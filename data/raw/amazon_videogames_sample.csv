4.0,False,"05 8, 2011",A31GUSMTXJN8FE,B0010AYJXI,H. Jones Jr,"Light and dark play a key role in Remedy's long awaited Alan Wake.  While at no point did I find Alan Wake to be all that scary, what I did find was a good story, combined with some great action sequences.  Unfortunately these action sequences do begin to feel a little repetitive and the facial modeling and animation of the characters are not very good looking.  It's not perfect, but it stands alone as a pretty unique thriller.

Dark and Light:

I shall try to keep this review free of spoilers, but I may let a few through just to warn you.  The basic premise of the game is that you are Alan Wake, a struggling author who is on a trip to Bright Falls, a sleepy town in the pacific northwest to try and get inspiration for your next novel.  Before you know it Wake and his wife become embroiled in what looks like one of Wake's novels come to life.  The story is pretty good, with a fair amount of twists and turns.  Best of all it's presented in an episodic format so it feels a lot like a TV show, like the Twilight Zone.  You'll spend most of the game at night fighting your way through the ""Taken"", which appear to be supernatural, dark representations of people living in Bright Falls.  Wake's wife is taken in the beginning of the game and you'll spend the game trying to get her back and trying understand the mystery of Bright Falls, all the while wondering if Wake is just crazy.  Central to the game is the theme of dark and light, with light from your flashlight being your primary weapon against the dark things in the night.

Additionally, other sources of light serve as safe zones and additional weapons, but most of the time you will be using a flashlight to destroy the taken's shield of darkness and then a conventional gun to finish them off.  Most of the game plays out as a third person shooter, but occasionally you will also get to use a car or truck.  Controls for the vehicles sometimes feel a little sluggish, but they get the job done.  Otherwise the control is pretty typical for an over the shoulder third person shooter.  Fighting the taken is fun and satisfying, and can get pretty hairy sometimes.  I would say the challenge is decent, but not much more so than any other TPS.

An Audio/Visual Feast, for the Most Part:

The lighting effects in Alan Wake are great and for the most part the game looks great.  The way the light of your flashlight affects the appearance of the environment is fairly striking, and in these moments I feel like it is one of the best looking games on the 360.  The inky blackness of the night surrounding the few light sources in the game, combined with patches of fog really sell the chilling, isolated atmosphere of the game.  The game really falls apart visually when you look at the characters' faces however.  The facial detail and appearance of the characters looks horrible.  The facial animation is not that great either.  I expected more from a story based game released in 2010, and it seriously impacts an otherwise very engrossing experience.  The audio component is just fine though music is moody and very fitting.  Voice acting is pretty well done and the sound effects are engaging.  From the sizzle of light hitting the taken to the swirling woosh noise as a new wave of taken attacks, the sound is pretty much spot on.

Haven't I Seen This Before?:

The game's biggest fault for me was that the environments aren't varied enough.  I've read other reviews that have said similar things and I must agree.  While the set pieces are good looking and moody in atmosphere, they all start to blend together in the middle of the game.  The logging camps and outbuildings all start to look the same.  I suppose this can't be helped too much given the setting of a small logging town, and to be fair it is broken up nicely by some genuinely interesting parts, such as the power plant.  This combined with the fact that you fight largely the  same taken enemies over and over lends a certain repetitious feeling to the game.  This and the jarring facial modeling was enough for me to detract a star from an otherwise good game.

Bottom Line:

Visuals:  Spectacular lighting effects and moody atmosphere make most of the game a visual treat, but are offset by some repetition of elements in the game and some pretty poor facial modeling, which is a big issue in a game centered around character and story.

Audio: The sound is great and the voice acting believable.  Many great rumbling 'poltergeist' style moments lend authenticity to the enemies in the game.

Gameplay:  The controls are solid and the action is fun and blowing away the taken is great fun.  The game suffers, however, from a lack of diverse enemies and fighting the same taken over and over gets a little too repetitive.

Story: The story is pretty good with plenty of moments when you wonder if this stuff is really happening to Wake or if he's just going crazy.  The ending is great, just don't expect it to explain everything.

Overall:  Good game start to finish, but it suffers in a lack of diversity in enemies and environments and some of the poorest facial modeling I've seen in a big title in a long time.",A Good Supernatural Thriller,1304812800,,,

This game is loaded and was very well thought out from the ground up.  The running game is fantastic, and I love how you can charge your player up for a super move.  It takes some pretty good timeing to get used to, however its fun and sometimes effective.  Should we even mention the passing?  It's awesome.  I love having the ability to check out the defensive formation, see who is going to have one on one coverage and try and exploit the weakness its awesome.  Oh, yeah and its also nice knowing that the computer on offense or defense is not going to auto adjust its-self to counter act what ever play you pick.  And lastly there is the defense end of things.  Gang tackling is a must and is very incouraged.  However the ability to read what the offense is doing or what you think they are doing, just adds so much realism.
Next, I would like to mention the presentation.  The graphics are almost perfect.  The cheerleaders actually shake there money makers.  And your fans go crazy, with face paint, signs, the whole 9 yards.  Not to mention the half time summary is truly amazing.  And then there are the instant replays WOW!!

Sure, there are additional things to do like by garages, hire drivers, expand your fleet, etc, but this game is all about the driving.  And it does that really, really well.

For a game released in 2013, the graphics aren't really anything to write home about.  It looks like a PS3 game released in 2009.  It's not a bad thing, just a thing.  I assume this is because the developers are an independent studio without the resources of a developer with publisher backing.  Don't expect great textures, but again, you don't need them.

The driving is really, really fun.  I really don't know why.  You just drive.  Pick a job off the job board and drive.  All the jobs require you haul some specific product or resource from point A to point B.  You can gain extra XP by transporting fragile or explosive payloads.  You also have to drive carefully.  Failure to follow the rules of the road will result in penalties and/or fines.  You better turn your lights at night, signal when you turn and drive on the correct side of the road.  If you don't, you'll pay the price.

Honestly, it's not a game I can marathon because it's fairly repetitive; but I love sitting down for 30 minutes and completing 3-4 jobs, earning a little money and making sure my driving team is keeping busy.  I also think the menus could be a bit more friendly.  They can be tricky to navigate, in my opinion.

Yes, the game is playable on keyboard and XBox 360 controller, but I suspect a wheel is really the way to go.  I've not played with a wheel, but I'm doing just fine with a controller and some minor tweaking.

I have five DDR games and I have an area of my basement set up with the PS2, the pile of games and the dance pad. I don't tend to play ""one game"" (in terms of DDR). If I head downstairs to dance, I play a few songs on one game, swap games, play a few songs on the next one and so on. I get a lot of chances to compare them all against each other, the benefits and downsides of each one.

DDR X is certainly shinier than the other games. They are pushing the PS2 to its limits with the graphics here. Really, though, who is watching the graphics when they are dancing? Yes, I love having the treadmill-dancing video running for OK Go (and missed half the steps the first time I danced it because I was having so much fun watching the video). Which sort of proves my point - if you are watching or paying attention to anything other than the arrows, you'll be in trouble :)

Since the arrows really don't change from game to game, all that really matters is the song list. This is a VERY subjective judgment. We all have quite different musical tastes. For example, in DDR X there are four songs I really like - and I'm not really fond of the others. I'm sure other players will have a completely separate list of songs in this game they adore. That's why it's nice to have so many options in the game, so that you can pick out the ones you like and ignore the ones you don't like.

I'm really glad they continue to come out with games for the PS2 to continue out the DDR game line. I like the steps and songs in my various DDR games and am always glad to be able to add more games into my workout mix. I'm sure at some point with the PS3 they'll come out with a DDR that lets you download songs and old step sets from the old DDR games, and at that point I might convert up to the PS3. In the meantime, though, this is a great option. I definitely recommend anyone who wants to get a good balance and cardio workout to look into DDR, look at the song set list for each one and choose a few that you enjoy. DDR isn't about just having one and playing only it all the time. It's about having a few, with songs you like, and enjoying the songs.

And don't worry, this negative review isn't all just about the visceral hatred of high fantasy involving lots of magic.  The game itself has plenty of bad flaws.

I used to love Warcraft. But I hate Warcraft since they made it ""Blizzard presents: Magic: The Gathering"".

My favorite thing about Warcraft was exactly what they took out in III and World of: a sense of grittiness and uniqueness in a world of fantasy. There were no ""Thyalawynd"" or ""Darkheart""s or ""Ebonheart""s or ""Gyilwind""s magic fantasy crap with gravity-defying robes and swords made of silver and no shields or any semblence of tactics or strategy or even blood.

There was no ""We ah the Knoights of Lothar the Guilywind, son of Gunther the Loinhearted, son of Baxter the Baxton, son of Aragorn of Aragorn, and we foight fo peeeeeace"" versus ""Graarrgh we are demon spawns from hell who want to crush the world and kill everything that moves"".

Warcraft wasn't like that at all---Warcraft had the Orcs coming into Azeroth because their own world was destroyed by civil war, and rather than accomodate, the Humans responded with war. And it blew up in their faces as the Orcs destroyed Stormwind Keep and forced the humans into Lothleroin, with the Orcs following. I don't remember what happened after that, but I think eventually the Orcs were beaten back by the Alliance of Humans and Elves.

Then I completely do not remember a single thing about Warcraft III other than Taurens supporting the Orcs for absolutely no reason, and the Undead randomly appearing out of nowhere for no reason, and Night Elves appearing out of nowhere for no reason, and lots of pixie dust sprinkle winds magic and demons and wizards and keys and powerups and upgrades and magical fire pansy moves of doom for make benefit glorious magician of kingdom of Godwynn EverNeverwind P. Dark-Ebonheart.

Warcraft and Warcraft II were to me, the modern Medieval-fantasy equivalent of Conan the Barbarian, in that yes, magic was there, and magic was used, but only the magicians practiced magic, and the magicians could not stand up to an army of a billion Orc Grunts and Troll Axethrowers.  Sure, then there came Ogre-Mages, Death Knights, Paladins, and the like, but even those were but a small asset in an army made to fight with steel and wood and flesh, not just magic.

Instead in Warcraft III, and extending into World of Warcraft, magic becomes the centerpoint of virtually any army.  You can still use the backbone of infantry and cavalry and the like, but their effectiveness against magical heroes and magical elves and pixies is reduced by the sudden jump in population everything costs and the stupid upkeep.

But while magic would become the more central point beyond Warcraft III, War3's focus instead came upon HEROES!

The entire RTS aspect of this game is not fully broken, but rather fractured by not just the inclusion, but the heavy reliance upon individual heroes, who have dozens of hero-only chests to pick up for upgrades and equipment that can make them MORE powerful, and they have the ability to LEVEL UP and research MORE abilities and powers.

At least half the missions in the campaign I was apart of either involved playing ONLY as heroes, or playing in such a mission that only heroes could determine the outcome of battles.

Then, UPKEEP.

The idea of upkeep in this game is in no way relevant to how upkeep really works in games like Total War or in real life.  Upkeep is the cost of maintaining an army.  Upkeep does not exist in traditional RTS games.

In this game, upkeep means ""you no longer mine as many resources"" when you have too many units.  And ""too many"" ranges from 50-75 population points taken up.

And then comes the fact that full-army battles are rendered impossible when the average Orc Grunt starts costing THREE population points, and the maximum population is no longer the Blizzard standard of 200, but somewhere near 125-175 or so.

Controlling the first level of upkeep means your peasants now gather 7 of a resource rather than ten.  Medium upkeep reduces it to 5.  High upkeep reduces it to 3.  And an army under high upkeep can consist of a handful of heavy units not fit to take out a militia force twice their size.

This is only balanced by the fact that it affects all player on a map.  But another problem involving this is that because the basic units take up so much population and are so ineffective, the player is basically forced into an arm's race with their opponents, to build up their base technologies, upgrade all they can, then build the most powerful units available while ignoring the 90% of other units available to train, just to meet an evenly matched opponent who has done the same thing.

And then again, the RTS idea is fractured and shattered by the powerful emphasis on building superunits and superweapons as quickly as possible, and to hell with all other available units.

This is not how a good RTS works.  Starcraft comes to mind: an army of 30 basic Terran Marines can slaughter an enemy army of Hydralisks or Ultralisks.  An army of 30 Battlecruisers seems unstoppable, and yet can easily be torn asunder by a few Corsairs or Valkyries, or a flood of Scourges.  Or they can be broken up from all-out attack from an Arbiter's stasis, or a Ghost's lockdown.  They can suffer huge splash damage from Psionic Storms from High Templar or Infested Kerrigan.

In short, in Starcraft, every unit is effective if utilized properly.  You can win one game by playing a megalomaniac and massing dozens of super units, and win another game in the same amount of time with a ragtag militia and some special tricks of infiltration and the like.

Warcraft III has none of it.  Every unit that is not a superunit or a hero is simply cannon fodder and/or base defense until that superunit or hero is available for building.

And so what was once ""WARcraft"" and I so deridingly called ""Magecraft"" could more accurately be called ""Herocraft"", because heroes are so ridiculously overpowered that they become the center point of every game, EVEN the skirmishes, as you cannot start unless you pick a hero for your side.  AND you can get MORE THAN ONE hero on a map, one for heavy combat, one for support, and one for magic.",Where it stopped being Warcraft,1238976000,6,,

The story mode is kind of numb, and i really hate the fact that you can't buy superstar points in the shop. if you're like me, you like to create a lot of characters, and, if you're like me, you like to copy your best superstar, then edit the copied one so you can have a new superstar with a good rating. Basically, you can't change their weight class when creating a new character off a copied one, to reset the attributes, so you can change them up. The create mode is really lame. The clothing sucks so bad in this game. My best friend's name is David and they don't even have that as a superstar calling name when you enter the ring like they did in the last one. Last time I checked, David is a pretty popular first name. Hell, it's Batista's first name.

Like all wrestling games, it does have a degree of fun- a very SMALL degree of fun. but this game is really really lame, and I find it hard to believe that people are saying it's ""a turning point in smackdown history."" how the hell do you figure? seriously. did you ever play the other games? you can't sit there and say it's the best of the smackdown games, because if you do, you must have never played another smackdown game. If you create a character, and, for example, you make them from Las Vegas Nevada, the announcer will say ""On the way to the ring, from Las Vegas Nevada, from Nevada..."" Why the hell are they saying the state twice? Make anyone from a city and state and when they are introduced, the announcer says the state twice.

There are so many damn glitches in this game, it's unbelievable. You have to be a damn cruiserweight to be a luchadore or martial arts?! That's pretty lame. Anyone remember Nathan Jones or Steve Blackman??? Both martial artists and Blackman was a heavyweight and Jones was a super heavyweight.

Story mode sucks. All I am gonna say. Music in the game is better, except for that one damn Money in the Bank song, which is probably THE worst song ever recorded.

Also, where the hell is Paul London? Sure, we have 4 friggon Mick Foley's, but no Paul Lundon or, as gay as they are, the Spirit Squad. They really screwed this game up in every way possible. They really rushed this game. All the little 10 year olds who like this game have no clue about any other WWE game, I can assure you, because this game sucks big time.

The role playing game aspects of experience leading to new abilities and new weapons is really addicting as the leveling up is not tedious in the early levels and really addicting as you bring new weapons into play. Basically as you progress through the multiplayer game you have experience affecting your rank and personal abilities, along with unlocking new sets of challenges. Challenges are ways of increasing rank more quickly as you get experience bonuses for accomplishing a challenge. One challenge would be to kill 5 enemies while in the crouched position or perhaps to call in 5 UAVs. Then there are also specific challenges associated with each weapon in the game. By completing these challenges, you not only get experience but you can acquire new camouflage for the guns or new scopes and capabilities.

So multiplayer aside, there is a great single player campaign here as well, but it is missing a multiplayer coop mode that would have made this absolutely stellar. The single player campaign puts you in the shoes of 3 separate soldiers with specific objectives to meet. The missions are well scripted (much to the same degree that the missions in Halo 3 or other Call of Duty games are well scripted), the story is well told and missions range from easy to fun to challenging without getting to terribly annoying. I ran through the game on Hardened difficulty and really got stuck in only a couple of places where I spent ungodly amounts of reloads attempting to accomplish the mission. But the ending is satisfying and spectacular and very anti-climatic.

Here's basically how it works:  you play as a young, horned boy named Ico.  You've been banished from your home village and offered up as sacrifice, due to what is implied to be a curse of sorts.  But a stroke of luck gives you the perfect chance to escape.  On your way out, you find Yorda, trapped in a cage dangling several stories from the ground.  While you cannot communicate with her through words (both characters speak different non-existent languages), you still feel compelled to save this alluring young lady.

In order to achieve your escape, and that of Yorda, you must pull her around by her arm (or in some cases, call her to follow you) and guide her through puzzles and obstacles through environmental manipulation, while overcoming well-thought-out and clever platforming tasks to do this.  You must also use simple but fun combat techniques to keep the evil shadows from pulling poor Yorda into a dark portal, thus ending the game.

Sound boring?  Well, it's really not.  Read on!

While most games that require you to lug an extra character around tend to be bothersome and tedious, there is something so gratifying about tugging Yorda around the gloom-and-doom castle in which this one-of-a-kind fairy tale takes place.

With every intricate puzzle, you will have ""ah-ha!"" moments, and ""huh?"" moments, and sometimes you will even get ""wow!"" moments.  Few games have provoked so much response from me as a gamer, and anyone looking to connect emotionally with the on-screen character (or in this case, characters), would be a fool not to play this game.

3.0,False,"11 19, 2004",AMZCQIDUWDHLC,B000066TS4,John. N,"Mega Man fans have had it tough over the last few years, with the obvious decline of the original Mega Man series and the once great Mega Man X series (although Mega Man X Command Mission was one of the more recent brighter spots).

To me, Mega Man Zero is an attempt by Capcom to resurrect the classic Mega Man X gameplay that was lost soon after Mega Man X4. After X4, the series began to seriously suffer as it seemed Capcom just made sequels just for the sake of making them.

Mega Man Zero is a many ways a sucess, but at the same time is not. On the plus side, I was very pleased with the inclusion of many RPG-like elements that the game employs, such as the leveling up of weapons and how crystals act as experence points for the cyber-elves. The addition of an elemental damage system is also another high point (even if it makes some battles pathetically easy). In lacing the game with RPG elements (like they did in Mega Man Legends), Capcom has added a whole new layer to the gameplay.

The inclusion of different weapons was also nice, as you could change your weapon on the fly to adjust for certain situations. The fact you no longer gain abilties from enemy bosses isn't such a problem due to this.

Unfourtately, Mega Man Zero falls short in many categores. The fact you cannot revist many of the games locations once they are completed is very troubling - if you miss a cyber-elf in a non-revisitable area you are out of luck (and your going to have to play it again). This means you must know where everthing is and thus takes bite out the exploration factor that Mega Man games are known for.

While the RPG-like cyber-elf system is a very nice change, but many of the elves crystal requirements are simply too large. You'll easily double your playing time trying to get them all to the higest level (unless you cheat - and you shouldn't - as cheating is wrong! lol). Some of the elves are also too powerful (the one that removes all the spikes from the game is so cheap it isn't even funny).

Mega Man Zero also ditches the tired and true ""stage"" system that is used in practically every other Mega Man game. While this too is nice change, the fact many places aren't accessible later in the game and many of the places look nearly identicle (and very drab looking as well), it proves that the tired and true stage method is much better.

Storywise, the game is really nothing special. Even with the use of many story screen stillshots and the useage of more dialogue than one would usually find in a Mega Man game, one will find Capcom did more with less in the past Mega Man X games.

Mega Man Zero is a good addition to the Mega Man universe, but one has to wonder how many sequels Capcom will have to make before this series starts to crumble and wither like the other  series (especially when your pumping out a sequel every year). Will the Mega Man Zero series survive Capcom's habit of smashing their game series with ""the sequel shovel""? Only time will tell.",An honest attempt to revive a dying series...,1100822400,2,,

Story: Somewhere in a medieval, fantasy world, a young family is besot by tragedy. When the father turns very ill, the two children of the family (brothers) go on a perilous quest to a find way to cure their parent. Along their journey they meet amazing creatures and people who help them.

Game play: Using one controller (you can also use a keyboard if on PC) you move two characters. I was afraid it would feel unnatural or be difficult to move both characters at once but it wasn't. After a while it seemed natural. The game is mostly puzzle solving with a few boss fights but don't expect to be picking up weapons. You use intelligence and skills to make your way across the world.

Who should play: There are some heartbreaking moments in this game and a few frightening images. I would say a twelve year old could handle it but I would be wary of kids younger than ten playing it. Why........

(SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS) We come across some horrific scenes. A women drowns, a man hangs himself (you try to stop him, I wasn't able to ) and in a dark forest a group of children (?) are hanging. These are few and far between but because we can't understand the language being spoken by the characters we have no way of knowing what kind of war is going on. We just feel the danger. Many lighter moments balance out these scenes but they foretell the ending to come. So parents, be careful. Older folks, you can handle this I be thinking ;)  (END OF SPOILERS).

You can easily play this game in a long evening or afternoon. Its a beautiful, sad but completely amazing game and you should play it.

I bought the game code and played it through steam on my Surface Pro 2 with an Xbox 360 controller. I had NO problems downloading or playing. I had NO glitches or freezes. Honestly, this was the easiest game I've ever downloaded and played.

This blurring effect gets really old, really fast especially when it completely masks everything that's happening and it is obviously an out of place tacked on addition; it's not enough to break the game, but it most definitely takes away from the experience (there's not much to be horrified or disturbed by except the executions - well that and perhaps the language and bondage themes). The graphics are great, and the rest of the game is executed nicely - mission areas are well developed, they load fast, there are interesting obstacles and 'puzzles' (very minor) to overcome as you move along. The AI is decent, though one wonders what kinds of shadows there are in the world of Manhunt 2, even while being thankful for their amazing powers of deception. The NPCs also say all sorts of funny things - they're not comedians but you will definitely get a kick out of the things they say.

You have several feedback tools including alertness levels, noise meter and radar (based off of line of sight and noise - it's not a freebie). Your view is a little restricted, but since the emphasis is on using your environment and stealth effectively (i.e. you'll have time to look around from shadows and such - usually - and plan your next move) it's not a big deal. The environments are interesting and well done, complete with plenty of action beyond the player's area, simply to create an immersive experience. The game saves at checkpoints automatically allowing you to progress quickly and without interruptions.

If you have the patients and interest in a horror survival game that focuses on killing in a real world setting as opposed to simply surviving or monsters and such then this is a great PSP game for you. The game recommends playing with earphones, and it truly is a better experience this way - the sound effects are pretty good throughout (and the expletives are there throughout as well).
This game is not (in my opinion) particularly scary, though it does have a wonderfully dark environment and emphasis, even if the story is somewhat lacking in intensity.

This game is over the top, it's fun and it's unfortunately hampered by the fact that Rockstar Games was threatened with an AO rating. Thankfully it's still fun to play - so good luck Danny.",Interesting Horror Game,1194307200,12,{'Style:': ' Sony PSP'},

My favorite part is Aqua's sequence, where it's like a tech demo of the upcoming Kingdom Hearts III, though with the gameplay similar to that of Aqua's playthrough on Birth By Sleep.
Now, I'm not a die-hard fan of Kingdom Hearts, I'm a fan. I know of the story mostly, but it's too complex. The small thing I dislike in the KH series is that they always reflect back to the younger Sora and Riku from the images of the first KH. They annoy me. Since Dream Drop Distance was portrayed after KH II, would it of been so difficult to have the older Sora in it, and take out the whole ""Command Deck""? KH I & II is the most popular because they don't have complications with their gameplay, same with Birth By Sleep with its less complex Command Deck. But with the gimmicky gameplays of the handheld games like Chain of Memories' card deck and DDD's command deck/weird mini-games, it's hard to play it.

Pure isn't bogged down by realism. You fly through the air and do some of the craziest tricks you'll ever seen in a racing game. The environments are gorgeous and lush. You'll travel all around the globe to race through a series of ten circuits with about 4 challenges each. You can create multiple bikes that specialize in speed, tricks, control and other items. The only down side is that their are a limited amount of challenges that sort of just repeat themselves throughout the game. Theirs the standard 3 lap race. A challenge mode where you have to get the highest score doing just tricks before you run out of gas. And lastly a  5 lap race with a much shorter track that relies more on technique than tricks and speed boosts. You'll have tons of fun unlocking new levels, characters, bike parts, and save slots for new bikes.

The only other con I can think of is the soundtrack choices and how the game doesn't allow you to use the new XMB function to play your own music while playing a game. Also a lack of trophies is a bummer. Everything else about this title is stellar and nobody expected the best racing game of the year to come from Disney.

I hadn't even heard of this game until I was browsing new PS4 games and realized that this one didn't even sound familiar to me. Honestly, I'm glad that I didn't know about this because if I had, I would be itching to play it and waiting for the launch.

After reading many reviews about how awesome this game is, I pulled the trigger, drove to the store, bought it, and was instantly hooked. When I look for horror genre related books/movies/games, I am looking for something that will hold my attention and that is suspenseful, engaging, and realistic. This game is the perfect mix of all three of those. To top it all off, it is truly chilling.

Just reading the description, I was instantly engaged: ""When eight friends become trapped on a remote mountain getaway gone wrong, things quickly turn sinister and they start to suspect they aren't alone. Every choice the player makes while playing as each of the eight friends  even the seemingly trivial ones  will carve out a unique story. The player's actions alone determine who survives until dawn."" I mean, come on, that's just amazing.

Until Dawn is a game where player choice determines the outcomes in each chapter as well as the ending. With this being the case, you can literally play the game multiple times and have a different outcome each and every time. All I can say is give this game a shot. The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are even better.

The gameplay of Until Dawn focuses on quick time events, and discovering clues. A system is added to keep progress of all the secrets you find, which can help you piece things together. It's been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain. The player can take control of each of the eight characters, and can make simple choices which will effect the way the game plays out, resulting in deaths or other mayhem. There are over thousands of different endings possible in the game.

I'd love to hear from anyone on how they feel the game is the further they get into the story, and I will plan on doing the same.",A must-have for any horror fanatics.

My hands are fairly large but not huge. I mainly wanted this mouse for the 6 thumb side buttons. Most gaming mice with these buttons have too many. I thought 6 would be just right for me. The positioning of the buttons and shape could be improved. They are thin and a little tricky to press. I personally have no real need for the dpi features or profiles. The mouse is very responsive and I have to get used to the idea that I no longer have to pick up and set the mouse down to move the pointer around. Infact with the shape of the mouse it is a bit difficult to pick it up one handed and it is a bit heavy; which I like. It is training me I don't need to do that anymore. Now I purchased mine used so the pads on the underside are worn pretty good. Because of this I suspect is the reason I find just moving the pointer short distances and being accurate is a bit tricky. I'll try some things to fix this issue that should only be an issue for me being I purchased mine used. Again, mine being used could be the reason I don't feel the right and left click have enough audible and tactile feedback.

This game has everything:
Trade
Diplomacy
Scientific advances
War & Peace
Exploration
Culture
Money
Space Race
EVERYTHING
For those who are not familiar with Civ2, I will explain as simply as possible:  The whole idea of the game is to build the BEST CIVILIZATION possible.
What does this mean?  MANY THINGS.
YOU CAN WIN IN MANY WAYS:
1) Build a Civilization that achieves military dominance...CRUSH THOSE WHO OPPOSE!
2) Build a Civ that overwhelms all over Civs, so they want to be like you...IF YA CAN'T BEAT 'EM, GET THEM TO JOIN YOU!
3) Accumulate points that you are awarded for population, happiness of citizens, and even gaining knowledge.  BE THE BEST YOU CAN BE!
4) Expand.  Just be the BIGGEST Civ and you win by owning 66% of the world's land!  GO WEST/EAST/SOUTH/NORTH YOUNG MAN!!!
5) Be elected UN Secretary General by the players ...PLAY NICE WITH OTHERS!!!
6) Win the Space Race.  FIRST ONE OFF THE PLANET WINS!!!
Now, you may ask: Well, how do I do this?  GOOD QUESTION.
The answer is simple:
Build Cities
Have Wars/Declare Peace
Trade resources/luxuries
Gain Knowledge
All of this is done at the macro and micro level.  You can control cities' production of units, improvements, and wonders of the world.  This can also be given to a COMPUTER governor (AI).  This will speed up the game.  But if you love strategy and you love detail and control...YOU CAN DO IT ALL.  NONE of it remains out of your control...if you want.
This game is perfect because it allows you to control what you want, and nothing you don't.  The AI is good, the graphics excellent, the concept SUPERB, and the overall game STUNNING.

You take missions and try to defeat the enemy. Its a totally 3D, totally 1st Person game. You take the spot land, sea or air. You can be a solider or tank crew or piolet or ship hand in an online 3D game. I won't even go into the details of how realistic the game is. One really cool feature is if you want to take out a tank, you don't just have to blow it up. You could shoot the driver through the slit in the driver seat, or throw a granade in the top, or blow the treds off or shoot the driver when he pops his head out the top, or any other way that a tank was taken out in World War 2. Also the war is planned out by real commanders, beople who pay the game and worked there way up in rank. Also the units are true to the time and historically acurate, so you will have to wait for 1942 in the game, to be a US solider and fly the B-17, but you could always be a tank commander while you wait.

There are 12 sequences in this game, without spoiling anything, you don't really start your official Assassin storyline until sequence 6. The first 5 sequences are all backstory and set up. While I found the first 2 sequences pretty entertaining (and a doozy of a plot twist at the end to get you pumped for the rest of the game), sequences 3-5 are SOOOOOOO boring and slow. It's basically one gigantic tutorial, and more backstory and set up. For someone who's played all previous Assassin's Creed games and knows how to free run, and fight, and so on, these tutorial sequences are punishing.

However, once you make it to sequence 6, you start your proper mission in the game and then all things are forgiven. The world is absolutely massive. There are optional objectives, minigames, hunting, sailing, and other shenanigans to take up. If you liked Assassin's Creed games before, you will love this game once you get to this point. It is worth mentioning though that enemies are in much greater number than before, and makes the game much more challenging than previous games. The minimap is also not as helpful. It doesn't point you to hiding spots, and doesn't point out wanted posters to lower your notoriety.

Naval missions should be a game unto themselves. Seriously, Ubisoft, make this a game unto itself. I will buy it. Trust me, you have never played anything quite like this in a video game before.

Overall, I was glad that I only paid $35 to buy this game. The 6 sequences make it hard to recommend this game. Sequences 1 and 2 are interesting and have a great storyline by themselves with a heck of a twist, but 3-5 are just terrible. From that point on its standard Assassin's Creed fare.

There may be some out their who like the alien i.e. Strogg part of the game which is one of the few things that I liked. I guess I will list what I consider to be the goodies in the game. First all maps are available, You can play either side, you can practice with the bots. Strogg has Mech. That's about all I liked, What I didn't like, The sound is pitifull, your weapons sound like the very first games on a nitendo or a pc with a primitive sound card. Some of the vehicles you can't drive and shoot at same time. No 1st person view in the vehicles except for some turret views. A lot of these type of games can get repitive but are still fun, I was bored in about 2 hours and wished I had held out for Battlefield Bad Company and just rented ETQW. The graphics are medicore, To me the game looked like it was produced just to make money. Just from looking at the amount of reviews so far, two, it doesn't look like a lot of people have gotten too excited by it. Also some games the controller layout is pretty intuitive, this is not one of those games. No melee, you get a knife but by the time you switch to it or grenade, well it's too long to cycle through.

5.0,False,"04 11, 2009",A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00149MEWI,Cloud,"Silent Hill: Homecoming is a noteworthy addition to the series for 2 reasons: one, it is not made by long-time makers Team Silent in Japan but rather American company Double Helix. Two, it adds new things never seen in the series such as a new camera style and combat mechanics. Fans were understandably skeptical and thought ""god I hope it doesn't suck"". While it's not flawless, I have to say I really enjoyed the game and as a fan of the series I don't consider this a blemish or an absolute triumph the way Resident Evil 4's overhaul was. It's entertaining and creepy and that's really all I was looking for when I played.

Story: You play as Alex Sheperd, a young soldier returning from the war when news that his younger brother, Josh, is missing. Coming into the town of Sheperd's Glen, Alex finds the town strangely deserted save for a few residents who act less than normal, a thick layer of fog and strange creatures around.  Alex has to uncover the truth of what's happening to his hometown as well as find his brother and almost literally has to go to hell and back to do so. The one issue people might have with the plot is that it's probably the most straightforward of the series. In a series known for being slightly ambiguous, there's really nothing here you have to ponder over or ask people online what it was you just saw.  While the actual story is interesting, some might not like that it's a bit easier to ""get"" a Silent Hill game.

Graphics: Originally the game previously had static camera angles which made it frustrating when escaping from a creature had you running back to them thanks to the angle switch. Now the camera is more free-roam in a 3D environment and it is way easier to navigate the levels.  Plus the levels are actually quite detailed and from the peeling paint and missing floors to the grimy and industrial look of the transformed versions of levels look quite foreboding and grimy. Only issue is that character faces look kind of...strange and your flashlight frequently goes from uber-bright to near useless. But the fog outside and the grain filter on several cutscenes is quite good.

Sound/Music: For those who have worries about the soundtrack well no fear, Akira Yamaoka is here with his trademark rock pieces as well as vocals by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn just like always. It's what makes the game quite special since everything about it in the sound mix from the ambience to win a drum piece would start up and the delicate and haunting piano themes help to punctuate certain moments. As for voice acting, everyone particularly Alex is well done that is except for one character: the reason you're playing through the game in the first place, Josh. He barely emotes and he's so flat and disinterested sounding that you can't believe you gotta save the little snot.

Gameplay: Since the camera's changed, the environments are a lot more spaced out, fully 3D so you have to push stuff out of the way, duck under openings, and climb over ledges and whatnot. In addition, the same items return from first aid kits to health packs and weaponry. Your inventory (health drinks, puzzle items) are on the LB whereas combat (knife, pipe, guns as well as option to turn off flashlight and the radio) is on the RB. It's a lot easier system to use than having to cycle through menus though occasionally I'll use a health drink when I didn't mean to. But I quite like the control scheme and camera and I kind of dread returning to the old style now. Only thing I wish was different is the puzzles since unlike Resident Evil's old love of doors that need emblems rather than just, you know, a normal key, Silent Hill's puzzles range from little logic puzzles to the always-popular sliding block kind. They're a bit too flow-breaking and never really sat well with me on this one.

Overhauled is the combat system and it's one of those ""works but other times doesn't"" additions. Whereas Resident Evil 4's gameplay change helped it for the better, it helps it here but doesn't perfect it. Basically holding LT puts you in combat stance or aim mode and A is your weak attack while X is your strong attack which can be held for an even stronger attack (your log chopping swing for the axe, or baseball swing for pipe for example) and your B will act is the mandatory dodge button. While enemies were easily avoided in previous games, because of the level layout such as cramped rooms, it's hard to escape enemies so you have to fight but some have really cheap attacks such as Siam while the Smog can best be killed using handgun ammo and it's always best not to waste those. It's much better than before but it's still got a few kinks.

In a strange bit of irony, Silent Hill 4: The Room and even 3 was criticized for being too stagnant, too familiar to past entries whereas Homecoming with its changes for the better has people lamenting the old style. I think they just don't like Americans doing it, personally and speaking as a fan I quite like this one but not necessarily loved. For me, nothing beats Silent Hill 2 but as a new entry in the series, Homecoming works quite well.",A surprising and welcome addition,1239408000,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Graphically 4/5 I think theres some parts they could've improved but overall it's rather good. the system runs a little rough here and there, but It hasn't effected or bothered my game play yet. The classes are fun to be part of although I immediately changed my classes after getting through the first part with one class. If you've played DA in the past this is essentially a must have to feel complete.
The story is huge and i'm constantly picking up a new quest here and there while trying to complete another one for some fool who can't carry a sword to protect themselves.
I haven't even came to killing a dragon yet (although one killed me because I walked up on its roost and spooked it) and I'm already immersed in and loving this game. The more you get into this game the stronger it will hold you. There's endless areas to explore, things to collect, and evil doers to slay.

The menu system I think could've used a little bit of work as well, although i have grown more used to it. I get a bit mixed up gearing up all 4 of my characters at once trying to remember which one wears what can be stressful. however once you get past the rush style life we're used to and pay attention to what you have, one can carefully plan a magic defense, distance, or CQC defense depending on what area you're coming up on to attack.

I did do this game as a download through xbox live i'm not sure if the disk is any different but something I do love is that I turn on my xbox, watch some netflix or something and when I go back to the game it's loaded where I left, no boot up or anything, simply constantly ready.

4.0,True,"02 10, 2017",A1HVSLIS25RNY6,B00ICWO1XA,Amazon Customer,"It was absolutely intriguing. This was a game I was very happy to play through. This setting was superb, and the gameplay was agreeable.

However, I will speak on something I was not fond of. There is a character, Triss, that loves the character you play as, Geralt. I even read Triss's character page and it read, ""She loves Geralt and wants more than anything for him to choose her"" or something. So I got to know Triss, and I liked her. The voice actress portraying her was a good choice, she has a very sweet voice, and her character design is different than most women, as she has a unique hairstyle. Also, they give her good dialogue and she feels like a real person, as is the case with many characters in this game. So, anyway, there are whores in the game that you can have sex with, but I never had sex with any of them or did anything with any women in the game. I was hoping that there would be a dialogue option to tell Triss, ""I choose you,"" but, there wasn't. Nothing happens. At all. So for me I felt like there was no payoff for being faithful to Triss...

Anyway, a lot of the quests in this game are pretty interesting. I really have no complaints when it comes to the setting and story and what not. Except that I would have liked more options at some parts to choose what happens. So storywise and setting was pretty solid.

Combat was pretty lame in some parts of the game. After you get the hang of it, it is decent, but nothing special. It just doesn't feel satisfying enough, and it sucks when you leave a village and immediately a giant scorpion will just kill you in a few hits. And enemies always try to outnumber you and then you have to try and roll around and separate them a bit so you even have a chance to get some offense in. So the combat is acceptable, but by no means is it good.

The map was not the most cooperative, and sometimes I was not sure where to go or how to get to the next section. Also there were several quests that I did not know how to finish and ended up skipping them unfortunately.

A downside is how the game is fairly linear and has a beginning, a middle, and then an end, and that is it. There are no other game modes than Story, and after completing the story I haven't touched this game since. Well, I tried to play through it again, but after 10 minutes I stopped. Most games I do not like replaying the Story. After hearing the same dialogue a second time, it loses the appeal. And in a game where you level up, going back to level 1 and getting killed easily is just not fun and leveling up again is not at all fun.

So I give this game a 4/5 for the reasons above. But this is a review of the game itself, if I was comparing it to other RPGs, this is better. It's not really something you can compare to games like Skyrim, as that scratches a different itch, but for me, as RPGs go, this is certainly one of the best on the Xbox 360.",One of the Top 10 Games on the Xbox 360.

At first, I thought this game was great. After playing it almost every day for about 5 weeks, I have a very different view.

Pros-

Most of the games are actually fun at first. You'll probably learn some words and their spelling. Easy to pick up.

Now for the much longer list of cons-

This game does a terrible job of gauging your current level. It asks you far too few words, almost all of which are highly advanced, and placed both my friend and I FAR lower than it should have. There's nothing you can do about that. I'm 24 years old, and after 5 weeks of updating my expression potential to 34%, I'm still seeing words like kettle, jaguar, squirt, traumatic, solitary, airfield, canine, rephrase, acoustic, receptive, sparrow, nutrition, slang, stumbling, optimism, and so forth. I would say 80% of the words I've seen on here are elementary school level, while the other 20% are middle-school level. I have not ""learned"" a single word that I would consider calling high-school level.

You'll learn very little for the time you spend playing. Of the few words that were new to me, hardly any of them were repeated more than a few times, often in the same day. You are bombarded with far too many words over time, when it should just be reinforcing groups of words before moving on to more. Also, the only time you actually learn anything is when you read through the definitions after each game. There's nothing at all to be learned by playing the games. It teaches you like a dictionary does. But the worst part is that there is no context or pronunciation! After playing for long enough, you will eventually unlock a game that doesn't count toward your EP, but does have recordings of the words being spoken as well as context examples. However, you can only access these one random word at a time. You are given very little time to read the examples. This means that pronunciation and context are on the game, but you can't look them up or access them at all while supposedly updating your potential to express yourself with words you don't necessarily understand.

The definitions are often VERY weak. The part of speech (verb, noun...) is not given at all. If a definition is too long then it simply cuts off rather than allowing you to scroll down to read the whole thing. Many words appear in their own definition, which is never acceptable. Words with multiple definitions will only have one of them provided. Some definitions couldn't possibly be more wrong: inflammable is defined as, ""Things that burn very easily."" First of all, inflammable is an adjective and the definition is given for a plural noun. Also, while it is technically true, it has been a VERY long time since vernacular changed to avoid confusion, and even my dictionary suggests that you not use the word like this.

The simple little games become mundane very quickly. You would have to play this game for several months to really get that much out of it, but it will get very boring long before that. Most of what your coach says to you is hardly better than mindless dribble. The graphics are quite simple and the music is extremely limited and dull. One day it randomly told me that the word of the week is minstrel. Apparently the word of the week means a word you won't be learning, because it never gave me the definition or even put it in any of the games.  It's not that uncommon for it to tell me that my EP has been updated when in fact it is exactly the same.

Ultimately, the developers were too lazy to provide the necessary elements for learning a new word, make it accurately gauge your personal level, come up with enough games to keep it interesting for a long time; they didn't even make sure they got the definitions right! They started with a great idea, and released a product that falls unforgivably short of its potential.",Not for people who are serious about actually learning the words,1200614400,49,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo DS'},

I'm a long time role playing games fan and player. I was excited about Risen because the same group made Gothic 1 and 2 which were great games. But I was very disappointed after playing the demo. Many problems with the game. First, combat is boring and clunky. This is one of the most important areas in a rpg to get right since you will be doing combat for a vast amount of time in the game, in Risen the combat feels really clunky and hard to control and is boring on top of it. I can't imagine playing through the whole game with this kind of combat engine and mechanics.

Second, the world feels compact and small. You barely move over a hill or some ground and you are already in the next important area of the game. For some reason they put everything close together on the island. Third, the world has blurry graphics and terrible lighting. All the textures are hard to make out and they have some kind of blurriness to them, the lighting is very dark and should have been much brighter. Everything looks washed out, murky and blurry. It's not an attractive world to walk around in or explore to say the least.

Lastly, this game is basically an inferior remake of the Gothic 1 and Gothic 2 games. Most everything is recycled from those games, including the sound effects and monsters. Except the voice acting is bad and uninspired, where in the previous Gothics they had good voice work that was memorable. Also the combat in those Gothics was way better and more exciting. Even the graphics were better in that they were more pleasing to look at and create a superior atmosphere, even though they are outdated by several years, than in this game which had a poor artistic vision.

My advice is to try the demo before you buy the game. And then go ahead and buy Gothic 1 or Gothic 2 instead and play that if you haven't already, they are much better games than this inferior remake.",Try before you buy,1255132800,6,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

LA Remix also has ad-hoc wireless racing for up to four players.

In short, at $40, this version of MC probably gives you the most bang for your buck.

Plus exotics like the Aston Martin V8 Vantage Roadster, the Ford GT and Shelby Cobra, a brace of Lambos, and a Saleen S7.  No Ferraris or Bugattis, unfortunately...

There are shortcuts and multiple routes... cop chases and interference... wild power-ups and air time... and your car takes damage -- too much, and the race is over!

3.0,False,"03 1, 2010",A3IVYLKD0GN1NV,B000WJFZEA,Eddie!!!,"This game is alot of fun. I have had it since it came out and I'm writing my first review for it now 3 years later in 2010.

Its an online only game and you can grab it at such a bargain for a mere $20. Warhawk has a following only compared to SOCOM. Plenty of people play online still and theres no problem finding a game 3 years from its release. The graphics aren't Uncharted 2 amazing but they look great.

The game play is awesome. Alot of variety. You can drive tanks, jeeps, and airplanes(Warhawks). Its fun grabbing some body on the battle field in your jeep and then plowing through the opponents base,mowing down enemies while you drive and your friend shooting the turret. Did I forget to mention JET PACKS?? Yes this game has jet packs. You can grab a jet pack, fly around maps while sniping, rocket launching, grenade throwing, machine gunning, or flame throwing enemies!!!

Now, this game is an online game so of course theres ranks to move up. All the guns are pick ups in the game, so theres no unlocking guns or different vehicles. You rise through the ranks by meeting requirements. Each rank has a certain amount of points you need to acquire and a specific medal to achieve. You earn points by defeating enemies, capturing flags, capturing bases, repairing vehicles, or what ever your objective is. You earn medals by accomplishing a specific achievement. For instance destroying 5 Warhawks while in a tank, or Capturing the flag 3 times in one Capture The Flag match. Theres about 20 ranks. You unlock new gear to customize your character and new paint jobs to customize your Warhawk when ranking up as well.

Theres plenty of game modes, and the max number of players on a map is 24. I do have some complaints. One major one is Friend inviting or grouping. You cant send game invites, or meet up with your friends in a group then go right into a game and be all together. The only way to do this is one person has to create a room, then your friends have to go to there buddy list and find your name, click on it, then join your game. Its a pain, especially when you have about 5 friends that want to play with you. Plus, if your friends follow you into a game some one else made it balances out the teams. So, if all your friends wound up on the other team you won't be able to switch teams unless the there team is down a man. ANOTHER, issue is the balancing of vehicles. You can blow up a Warhawk with one tank missile, yet you can fire a barrage of missiles at a tank and it won't explode. The game is titled Warhawk yet the weakest vehicle in the game is the Warhawk.

All, in all this game is extreme fun. I refuse to trade this game in 3 years down the line because I keep coming back to it for days at a time. A MUST OWN for a PS3 owner.",SO MUCH FUN!!! HUGE FOLLOWING!!,1267401600,,"{'Edition:': ' No Headset', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

First, the Plantronics feel great. The plastic feels sturdy. Also, the headphones are extremely comfortable. I wore them for over three hours and didn't realize I had them on until I got up and nearly dragged my PS4 and iPod across the floor!

The set up was a bit tricky. The instructions are easy to follow but -- there are some wires to deal with, coupling that with the many that are already all over my floor ... it's not pretty. It is a sacrifice. But to have custom soundtracks while playing all the launch games I purchased, and knowing that I had the ability to chat comfortably, and not worry about that horrible ear bud that came standard with the PS4 made it worth it!

What I do/don't like about the Rig? I honestly can't think of a negative. I swapped out my iPod and tried it with my Cowon X7 and it still worked. I tried it also with my PS3 and my 360, and got the same results. It also comes with two mics so you can use the RIg on the go. I wanted to see how these held up with my Klipsch. I use Klipsch on the go because the sound on them is EXCELLENT and if they were to be lost I wouldn't have to break the bank to replace them (they're reasonably priced).

I can forgive an incomprehensible story, but I can't forgive terrible platforming mechanics and a boring combat system especially if those two pieces of broken gameplay make up 80% of the game.

First the jumping/platforming mechanics. You will be really annoyed. The collision detection is spotty at best so you will fall to your death quite a lot and will curse the game for not thinking through the fixed camera's poor choice of viewing angles.

The combat system is a based on three weapons and every type of enemy has a weakness to each. This rock-paper-scissor system would be fun if it weren't so poorly executed. You have essentially one main attack per weapon and you'll spend the entire game mashing on the one button to fight the same three re-skinned enemies. Fortunately there are boss fights that break things up otherwise it would have been seven hours of monotony. Aside from that, the attacks are far from accurate and you never feel like you're wielding a giant magical blade or massive gauntlets, it feels like swinging around a wimpy wad of wet newspaper producing equally wimpy sounds.

It's so quite when you play a game and makes little to no noise when you are on YouTube or other media services. It's so majestic with its led lighting and parallelogram shape. The controller IS a step up from the PS2/3 one but I'm still getting used to it. The only bad thing that I encountered was how long it took me to download games that I had from PS3 that included free upgrade to PS4 like COD AW. I was also sent a voucher code for my choice of 1 of 4 games for free, naturally I picked Far Cry 4 and ignored the others, it wasn't until 11:30pm till I was able to play a game I wanted because of the download time but I tested my connection and it was at 12-14 Mbps compared to the normal 35-40 Mbps that I'm used to so Internet was slow that day. So it's just me. But I will probably buy physical games for now(maybe) just to avoid the download time. Biggest game I have is COD AW at 45 GB compared to biggest game on my PS3 which is at 22 GB(same size for Destiny PS4) so 500 GB is probably not as big as first expected, for PS3 yes but for ps4 tyou will eventually run out of space. Luckly Sony lets you UPGRADE the hard drive unlike a certain company. So I might upgrade to a 2 TB later in the year just so I won't have to worry about space anymore. I will also install intercoolers because it maintains the motherboard cool therefore making your console last forever.....until the intercooler gives up of course.

graphics: I thought that this game will be a next gen  game but the graphics are just a little bit better than call of duty modern warfare 3 about 15% so I don't understand why does the game take so much space to install?

weapons: the weapon selection is very nice and they look very good but the sound of the gun shoots makes you thing that you are shooting a toy, I understand that this is a game but when I compared to the sound of the guns in battlefield 3 or 4 or medal of honor warfighter which by the way looks graphically  better that ghost you realize that they developers did not care about the sounds of the bullets fired by the weapons.

They're not ""oh my god!"" amazing, but they are far better than I expected for the ~$45 price tag. I anticipated burning through them fairly quickly (out of dissatisfaction or low build quality) and moving up, but I always like to give entry-options a whirl. These are a surprisingly great piece of hardware!

Pros include really decent sound (both headphone and mic), nice inline controls, really well designed microphone (I love how it bends and easily swivels out of your way if not using), comfortable padding around the ears, a nice braided cable, nice swivel ear cup design, and other features that I would anticipate on a higher quality set only. However, it's not without some drawbacks. The biggest drawback is that, despite the fairly ample padding on the headband, these things hurt the top of my head. I've gotten used to it, and they no longer bother me, but for a long time, I could only use them for 20 minutes at a time or so, before my head was really sore. Wearing a hat helped some, but ironically, now seems to make it worse. The only other problem I've had with these is that the sound from the headphones sometimes bleeds over into the mic. When I'm playing a game and I'm talking, people can often hear my in-game sounds, whereas they should only be hearing my voice. I don't think it's a volume thing with sound escaping the headphones. I get the impression that the audio is bleeding over somehow, be it a hardware or software problem. Then again, I could be wrong about the origin of the problem.

That said, it's a small drawback in an otherwise really great headset. I'm not sure that paying two or three times as much as any chance of netting you a two or three time gain in quality.

Puzzle Quest manages to stand on it's own thanks to it being an incredibly addictive mash of puzzle and RPG elements that set it apart from the rest of the pack.  Starting out as a typical RPG, you perform combat by partaking in puzzles that are reminiscent of Bejeweled.  You take turns moving pieces around and the game even requires some strategy to it as well.

Not to mention that many of the enemies throughout the game can be very frustrating, but the good definitely outweighs the bad here thanks to the addictive gameplay.

-  Similar to other past superhero games, each level/checkpoint looks exactly like the one you just left...with some minor changes.
-  Also, the enemies came at me in waves so familiar I could feel a spider web shooter slowly forming on my ring-hand wrist.
-  I always seem to be destracted by how the camera angle is not adjusted during play with the right stick.  The default angle serves you pretty well undr most conditions but I kept hitting the right stick late into the game expecting to move the camera.
-  I can't wait until technology finally catches up with the potential for superhero games.  I'm burnt out on the small character in the middle of the screen with limited powers and no ability to fly at will.

The Good:
-  The did a good job with the ring weapons.  There are enough I didn't get tired of them through the whole game.  And, you can't over-use any single one since your enemies will demand certain attacks.
-  The two player set-up is good, you're able to join in at any time.  I do not beleive the 2nd player can earn achievments.  But, that second person comes in handy for sure, especially if you don't play on the easiest level.

Come on video game makers! We need a new mindset or something when it comes to these classic superhero's being brought to life in games.

Instead they give you a simple mftr slip with the control scheme and Steam activation process. Read steam part thoroughly before anything else of course. Now the game is awesome. I reinstalled Windows XP and everything else just to be on the safe side being I was getting errors previously. Put in the DVD-ROM and I was off to installing HL2. Steam didn't take long and I was gaming within forty minutes. Steam installed the other included games as well. I've never played any previous HL variants and I must admit I'm itching to try HL Source1.

Great thing about DVD-ROM is none of the annoyance with swapping installing CD-ROMs otherwise DVD-ROM is not needed to game. Definitely want to clear out HDD space or defrag at least prior to installation. Game runs great and very DOOM 3 like scares/chills around every corner. The biggest nuisance for me are the getting STUCK BEHIND OBJECTS (Stairs, steps, ladders, flat objects/debrew inches off the ground!) often in the most critical moments. Thats a big bug it definitely ruins the moments that should be flawless.

Game progress is very good pace. Playing with all in game video settings set to *High, but the game still doesn't look as sharp as Far Cry or Doom 3 on my PC. Of course my PC is nothing special either. System specs: Gigabyte NForce2 GA-7N400 PRO2, Athlon XP 2600+ 2.079 GHz, 512MBx2 Geil Value PC3200 Dual Channel, ATi AIW 9600 XT, and Thermaltake 480W PSU. I'm happy with the video display I get, but definitely know I'm not getting the full experience. I guess HL2 auto-detect won't allow for Very-High settings if system can't run smoothly, because my game play is quite smooth even at HIGH settings with 2X AA. Definitely give this game a go, but make sure you have Internet connection first. Also I trully recommend at least a videocard upgrade to an ATi Radeon 9600 PRO 128MB (around $100 at NewEgg.com) or anything equivelent or better that fully supports DirectX 9.0b features. Being STEAM is a long-term uncertainty and unsure about reinstall process definitely make the first run the best. Do yourself a favor and buy this game.

4.0,False,"12 24, 2015",A3F8T3BRXRX5P3,B00HNYWFMC,JWINK,"This compilation comes with Far Cry 2, Far Cry 3 and Far Cry Blood Dragon and my particular disk has all three games on it that you have to install to the PS3.  None of the games had download codes, so at least it appears with latest compilations being sold (of course that may depend on the seller), they are all on disk.  With that being said though, each game does take a bit of time to install from the disk, especially FC3.  I always tend to be a bit behind on games I want to play, mainly because I usually wait for the prices to go down from the usual starting price and the lack of time I have to play.  Because of that I sometimes miss some of the ones I want to play and the Far Cry series is one of those, but when I saw this compilation recently go on sale during the holidays for 12 dollars for the 3 games on PS3, I bought it.  I figured that if I didn't like it so much, it wasn't a big investment per game, plus it gives me a chance to decide if I like the series enough to get the new Far Cry games later on that are out on PS4.

Granted these games have been reviewed individually since they have been out a while, but since I am new to them, I will give my initial impressions to each.

FC2 is probably my least favorite of the three games due to some of the limitations in gameplay but considering this game is around 7 years old, it still has some things going for it that makes it fun to play.  The graphics are decent considering the games age, although it would have been nice if they had released a remastered version with updated graphics.  The sounds in the world are realistic from the wild animals in the jungle, to the crunch of the brush and even to the crusty old jeep you drive.  The story line is decent and interesting enough to make me feel involved in the outcome.  I am only about 20 percent in but there seems to be a lot of missions and things to do, although I will say some of the missions are a bit repetitive and at every guard post it seems you get attacked.  Sometimes it is hard to see enemies as well when they seem to be able to hit you much easier than you can them.  The whole malaria thing to me is a bit annoying but it does add a different element to the game.  I also think the driving with the GPS and using the map while walking is not as intuitive as I would like and a bit distracting, but it could also be because I have been use to different styles of gameplay from other games and it is taking me time to adjust.  There are a few issues I have found as well such as a guy shooting a different direction and I still get hit.  There is some variety in the weapons and upgrades but limitations with carrying them and ammo.  I am also not crazy about the save in certain spots limitation the game has on the PS3 as well.  As a game on its own, I am not sure I would have made a solo purchase but as part of this 3 game package, this is a decent enough to make me feel like I got my moneys worth.

As it is expected with sequels (especially one that has nearly 4 years since the previous FC2), FC3 is sleeker and sharper with its graphics with a large environment that has many more things to do than FC2.  In addition to the missions, there are the added elements of hunting and making things in the game.  Although I am not quite as far into FC3 as I would like to be, mainly because I want to finish up FC2 before I move onto to the next, I have so far enjoyed this game enough to make this purchase worth it for this game on its own.  The graphics and sounds within the game are good and much improved over the previous FC.  The story for me is interesting enough to get me involved right away with the game opening with you stuck in a cage trying to make a dramatic get away.  The missions seem at least to me from the onset seemed to be more focused and directed but not so much that it detracts from the open feel.  There is a really nice balance of stealth and combat here that gives some variety in how to approach a mission.  There are a few minor issues that I have come across but they are not enough to make me stop playing.

Blood dragon is something a little different than what I have come to expect in the series but with being different with its tongue and cheek sci-fi approach.  Since I am working on finishing the first two games, I have played this the least but the game play seems to be pretty similar to FC3.  Considering this was DLC originally this is pretty good game overall, but as with most DLC it is not as deep with as much gameplay as the FC3 main game.  As part of the 3 game package though, this makes a nice diversion to play once I finish the first two games.

Overall, for a 3 game compilation at less than 20 bucks, then this is worth it, especially if you are like me and missed playing all of the games in the series when they first came out.

3.0,False,"06 22, 2012",A1CB8HH9YJ2YZE,B003VAHYQY,TheITMan,"I like this controller, it works for basic games, but the joysticks aren't the best. They do have some deadspots,and just don't respond well. Also my up button on the D pad randomly shorts out every once in a while. I had my camera view bound to that button and my view would randomly change from time-to-time. I deactivated that button and moved the camera view to another button and it never happened again. It seems to short out or something while playing.

Some of the buttons aren't reconized by games. I play Dirt 3 and the D pad and buttons would not work on the game menus. I had to use the keyboard to change options or settings or join or leave races. I thought it was the game that was designed bad. But today I got an XBOX 360 controller and hooked that up. The D buttons and other buttons now activate the game menus so I no longer need the keyboard at all. Also, the game now provides me with extra options that I've never even seen before, like changing the person who I am spectating during the race or changing over view settings that I never new existed so I now get more functions with the game. Those functions never even showed up in the game until I plugged in the new controller. The icons were always there, but they were grayed out.

I don't know why this controller wouldn't operate the same menus. And there is no way in the games options to bind the keys to any menus.

I do like the controller and I'm going to keep it incase my XBOX 360 controller breaks, but I probably won't use it anymore.

Also, the B button seems to short out as well. I had my horn bound to the B button and it would randomly work and if I held the button down after a few seconds the horn would stop. I thought that was the game as well, but that doesn't happen on my new controller.

It's a nice controller, and feels good in my hand. But for a few dollars more, you can get one that is much more responsive and provides more support for game functions.

4.0,False,"09 19, 2010",A11JU33HMT5XPU,B00002STIE,S. Lawrenz,"Broken sword is an Adventure style game that follows the adventures of an American named George Stobbart in Paris.  While at a caf, he is nearly the victim of a bombing.  Driven by irritation at the fact that he was nearly killed and that someone died as well as a sense of adventure, he begins a private investigation into the bombing.  He is helped along by a young woman journalist named Nico.

What he finds is a conspiracy that stretches across Europe and holds within it, the secret of the lost treasure of the Templar knights.

Review:
I have played one of the sequels to this game and found it somewhat entertaining. When I found this game I thought it was worth giving it a try.  I was wise to do so as Broken Sword is easily one of the more entertaining adventure games I have played in some time. It's not an entirely serious game and has some somewhat comic moments. But it has a decent plot for an adventure game and enough of a hook to make the player want to keep playing to the end.

Graphics:
As a game released in the late 90's in the middle end of the Playstation's lifecycle, Broken Sword is something of a throwback. It boasts hand drawn backgrounds for its various locations. The characters are cartoonish sprites rather than 3d renders.  For this type of game, that is generally to be expected.

The game boast various cut scenes as well. These are cartoon animations, somewhat cheesy in nature, but staying in the same style as the character animations in the game itself.

Obviously, the Playstation graphics are not as nice as those found on the PC, given that the Playstation has a much lower resolution than the PC.  This does hurt the game a bit I'd say, but certainly the game is par for the course in terms of this type of game on the system.

Sound:
Broken Sword is fully voiced.  There are probably around 15 to 20 fully voiced characters. The major characters are well voice acted, though at times the sound quality seems a bit spotty.

Music and sound effects are mediocre.  This is not a strong point for this game.

Gameplay:
Gameplay in Broken Sword is traditional point and click adventure fare. This is actually the first time that I have played an adventure game on the Playstation.  Given that it was designed for a point and click interface, it easily could have gone horribly wrong. It doesn't, but it does have its moments.

Be sure to read the manual. It warns that the mouse cursor has three speeds, medium, which is the default speed, slow and fast.  The game moves the cursor more quickly by skipping pixels on the screen, which is still far slower than a computer mouse. The slow and fast modes are activated by holding the shoulder buttons on the controller.

I did not realize this at first. After dying in the game, I retraced my steps and for the life of me could not collect a critical object needed to advance.  The cursor needed to be within a few pixels of the object to detect it.  The default speed kept jumping over the item. It took a while to realize what was going on and use the shoulder buttons. This could be a potentially game breaking problem, though if players are aware, it's easy to overcome, though hunting the pixel will thus become more prominent.

There are also some points in the game where quick action is required or the player will die.  With a mouse, this would not be a problem, but with a controller, it can get tricky if you're unfamiliar with the controller or the game controls.  Saving your game often becomes a necessity as these points are game enders.  Thankfully, there are only a couple of them.

As a side note, this game is compatible with the PlayStation mouse if you have one. I have no idea if a mouse works on the PS3. I didn't actually try that.

Aside from the above, Broken Sword's puzzles are really not that difficult and for the most part, fairly logical. At only one point did I feel the need to use a walkthrough and I feel it was at the only point of the game where it wasn't clear that the action could be taken.  I would say that this game is a medium level difficulty game.

Story:
The plot of Broken sword is standard conspiracy theory stuff twisted in with some amount of real history. The Templar Knights feature quite heavily.  George Stobbart is a fun character with a dry wit and of course, Nico is appealing with her French accent.

Players travel all over Europe looking for clues and meet characters that are unique and memorable.  I seem to recall that this was the case with the other Broken Sword game I played. Characters were something developed quite heavily.

Some things seems to come just a little too fast for my taste. I felt there should have been more build-up for the revelation of the conspiracy and also, for the romance between Nico and George.

Bottom Line:
Despite being 12 years old, Broken Sword remains a fun game and a nice diversion. The puzzles are really not that difficult, especially for experienced players, and the story is solid enough to keep a player's interest.  Controller difficulties can be a problem at times, but forewarning can keep those to a minimum.  Playtime probably would average 8 to 12 hours depending on player.  4 stars",A solid adventure game gets a turn on the Playstation,1284854400,,,

I say this as a gamer who, if absorbed and entertained enough, will spend a few hours of my weekend trying to get farther.
I have been a fan of Squaresoft since I first rented Final Fantasy 3 when it was first released on SNES.  I then proceeded to enjoy Secret of Mana and Secret of Evermore.  A few years later, I bought a Playstation and quickly acquired Final Fantasies 7 and 8 and Legend of Mana.  I also currently own Final Fantasies 9 and 10, and Final Fantasy Tactics.  These are simply a few of the great games I have bought, received as gifts, borrowed, and rented over my 16 years of life.
When I first heard about Kingdom Hearts, my reaction was the same as many Squaresoft fans, ""Squaresoft and Disney!  What are they thinking?!""  When I went to Amazon.com, however, to see what other gamers said about Kingdom Hearts, I found many people who shared my reaction, but had bought the game anyway, and all of them had given it five stars.  So I bought it.
There are so many things that make this game what it is.  For one thing it has a fantastic storyline.  Although it took stories from about 10 Disney movies, the story line in Kingdom Hearts is quite original.  Most of the movie plots were changed to allow for disc space and for the story of the game as a whole.
The voice acting is quite superb, especially the voices of Sora and the villain.  The game is made so that it can be enjoyed by all ages.  It has no ""mature themes,"" but is full of emotion.  The fighting is restricted to cartoon characters, and is not as violent as most other games of the genre now can be.  The action is enjoyable because it is always moving, action constantly continues unless there is a movie scene.
I just recently completed the game on normal mode.  As soon as ""The End"" came on the screen, I went and started again on expert mode, which, when I complete it, will give me access to hidden extras.

I have an original DFP wheel, I have the G27, and I had a G25 as well.  None of them feel as good or as accurate as the DFGT... and the DFGT costs half as much as the G25/G27.  Plus the DFGT has those great extra adjustment buttons/wheel for tweaking car settings on the fly, very useful for games that want to force driver aids on you (sometimes you can use the DFGT to turn off ABS and such).  And the force feedback, wow it is so great that you can practically drive one-handed and have no problem countersteering accurately to save slides as your other hand is working the sequential shifter or something.  NO other wheel I've tried can do that (I've never owned anything from Thrustmaster though).

Of course the pedals are not so good - fortunately my dead G25 donated its pedal board to a re-wire so it will work with the DFP or DFGT.  That is a fantastic combination, and even on PC games where I could combine any wheel and pedals I want (e.g. DFGT wheel with Fanatec CSR Elite pedals) I eventually would come back to just using the modded G25 pedals - no load cell brake, but somehow the pedals just feel nice for my feet.

Do be careful with this wheel though - it tends to get a little loose around the middle after hardcore use.  You certainly don't want to have any percussive maintenance from game rage, it will not withstand very much of that since it's all plastic.

3.0,True,"06 29, 2011",A2MYRRBXB3WTNO,B003UF9E0O,Craig H. Dolphin,"Many of the issues I have with this game have been clearly articulated by others. To sum up: over the top combat animations, lack of a tactical camera, excessive 'waves' of enemies during encounters, repeated (ad-nauseum) sterile environments, and pretty lame story (the unkindest comment I can give for a studio like Bioware).

For me though, the change to the art style from the 'antique baroque' of origins, to the 'sparse semi-anime cartoon' of DA2 was not a positive. Granted: appreciation of particular styles is entirely subjective. But for me, at least, I hated the bland and empty environments, the sadly comical take on darkspawn, and the uglification of the elves. The sole improvement was the redesign of the qunari who do look a lot badder (in a good way) than they did before. Although, even here, they do tend to look like clones of each other. Not sure if that's meant to be (lore) or simply more copy-pasting by the dev team.

If you played origins, be prepared for a more responsive combat experience (a plus IMO) but along with it be prepared for some absurd and ninja-clownish combat animations (especially if you like playing rogues). Amongst my favorites (not) are the exploding enemies (apparently darkspawn and people in DA2 are actually water balloons that explode on contact), and the cartwheeling in-place rogues (try THAT without a treadmill). And placing area-of-effect spells without a tactical camera on PC was a real PITA.

Also, the game features a new protagonist (Hawke) who is human only, but thankfully who can be either male or female. S/He is also fully voiced, unlike origins. Personally, I liked that. Your mileage may vary. The dialog interface is now a radial wheel featuring short paraphrases as options, like in Mass Effect, with the addition of icons to let you know that the dialog choice may lead to provoking a fight, pursuing a romantic plot, etc.  For myself, I'm neutral about the new system. Most others either love it or hate it.

The skill tree system in DA2 is one of the few genuine improvements over origins IMO. As is the option to make equipped helmets 'invisible' to the player so you can actually see facial expressions etc instead of endless shots of another stupid looking helmet.

Speaking of equipment, as it turns out, evey armorer in Thedas has apparently identified Hawke as the only customer whom they will design armor for. That's right, none of the items you find (aside from rings, amulets, and belts) can be used to equip your party members. Instead, you can purchase or find upgrades for their own distinctive armor. It leaves me cold personally, but it is a triumph of style I guess.

For me, the worst aspect of DA2 was the new take on the way you interact with your party members. In origins, you could initiate dialogue with your party members wherever you happened to be. In some contexts, the response was relatively limited, and in others, more options became available over time. And, of course, various locations triggered some other conversations as well. It was a mixture of player initiaive, situational triggers, and location/event triggers. In DA2, they have removed the ability to initiate conversation with your party members anywhere except in the party-member's home base. So basically, when I played through it felt like the party members ceased to be 'people' the moment you stepped away from their home base and simply became walking combat statistics. (To clarify, there are also still location-triggers for conversations too). Their personality was largely hamstrung IMO. And I guess it should be mentioned that many of them had a unpleasant personalities to begin with. One of the few bright points was being given the option to kill off two of them (but only near the end, and long after I'd begun praying for the option).

There were a lot of other problems with the game too: from a static 'world' that never felt alive in any way, to the absurdity of a mage pc casting spells in front of templars who showed not the slightest interest in the phenomenon, when the entire game revolves around the persecution of mages by the templars.

I think the reason I felt most sad about this game was that DAO was such a great game, and DA2 was a merely competant game. I felt little towards the party members, and even less towards the city of Kirkwall. It is the first time I've played a Bioware game and not loved the NPC's and the setting. The endless cutscenes, and the lack of player intiative in starting dialog, made it feel to me that while it was Hawke's story unfolding in the game, I was merely a button pushing bystander. Large gaps in the timeline exacerbate that feeling. Hawke starts each chapter encountering / talking to people he knows, but who you don't. After a bit, he ceases to feel like my avatar in the game world, and instead I'm left feeling more of a voyeur in his story. The story itself is almost completely linear, makes little sense in some spots, and has very little replayablity IMO.

I realize I've focussed primarily on the negative here and I don't want to leave the impression that I hated the game. The thing is it's hard to find positives when all you can feel is massive disappointment and when very few of the stylistic changes actually align with my own subjective tastes. I suppose I could give thanks for the lack of in-game DLC salesmen this time around?

For me it was a 'meh' game at best. I regret preordering it to get the signature edition bonuses. In retrospect, waiting to buy it at a lower price would have been the right move. I most certainly will not be purchasing any of the post-launch DLC for DA2. And more than likely I'll not be preordering DA3 given that the developer's new direction has so markedly and suddenly diverged from my own preferences.

If you like JRPG's, then I think you'll likely find DA2 to be more in line with your taste in gaming than I did. Otherwise, I'd recommend waiting to buy it once it hits bargain bins. I gave the game 3 stars, which I think is fair. It doesn't suck totally, but I certainly can't rank it anywhere near good or great games.",Meh,1309305600,,"{'Edition:': ' Signature', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

I gave Rome Total War 1 star because I simply hated it, boring to be honest, stunning graphics, but a snooze, Age of Mythology scoring 3 because it had a better story, but this one is a lot more interesting than the others because it puts YOU in control making YOU feel like you are God or something with 4 meter tall robots coming out of the factories screeching lines like ... I am here to serve you master, so you link it with about twenty flying infantry, a leader and off you go with a row of tanks to smash up the enemy orc base. Sounds like any other game, but not Warhammer, just because it is so immersive and the new developments in what you can do and build are many making this the best thing since Red Alert.

The story however is a bit of a let down, a massively impressive opening sequence however with a little bit of back story but the cut scenes just get in the way of the action and you have a good idea of what you must do, get building, get creating, set up defense, make up a strategy and listen to the robots as they hail you to take them off to war as if they really want it. There is a nice change of character types, new items and places to explore. Although somewhat short it packs a whopping punch to boot.

Linear in terms of start here, finish there, all RTS games are nearly the same, save for Dungeon Siege, but that is another game altogether. Here the science fiction world of robots and armored killing machines meets orcs and space entities that all want a bit of your land. There is simply something new at every turn to ponder.

I am impressed by the quality of the battles, very smash 'em up with buildings going up in smoke, space jets flying around the place and giant robots mashing up an enemy mech squad, all pleasing to the eye but require a high end system to match the graphics.

If it is RTS you are looking for then WH40000 is really where it is at. The only disappointing aspect is that the backgrounds are either white or blue with no atmosphere which makes the low angle battle scenes look set against a giant blue bitmap that could have better. Still though, that aside, it is just a big mecha juggernaut of a RTS game that deserves the week or two you will get out of playing it now and again.

If you liked grand theft auto (v or otherwise) then play that game for the driving and shooting stuff. The controls in Watch Dogs were uncomfortable, even after allowing a week of daily play to adjust to them. The driving was horrendous, and, I'll admit, I'm a terrible video game driver, but I much preferred the mechanics in GTAV and I didn't like those either. The ""snap to cover"" concept was poorly executed as well. One last thing and I'll stop complaining: the Pice de rsistance was supposed to be the hacking capabilities that the main character had. This, too, fell short for me and left me thinking that this hacking idea was more of a gimmick than an actual pivotal part of the game.
Okay, so I lied. The final thing in my diatribe, is the story. Never in all of gaming's history have I been so uninspired to play the story out. The characters were all cookie cutters from other stories and were too cliched and without any real depth. This is a REVENGE story, end of point.

A good part of the excitement on the show is the different personalities and Howie's comments to the people and all the silliness.  The voice of Howie Mandel is real in the game, but there's no way to have the interaction and the give and take that you have on the show.  That said, if you were playing the game with other people in the room watching in 1 player mode, or playing one of the custom games with up to 5 players, the conversation on your end might supply the party atmosphere that you see on the show.

Everything is otherwise much like it is on the show, with the audience, the banker, etc. and you can play with your Mii which I thought was kind of a nice touch.  The one thing I was not impressed with is the graphics.  Howie looks similar to the real Howie, but there are lots of ragged edges to the graphics.  They should be smooth.  I'm playing on a big screen TV and using component cables, but the graphics were rough enough that I went back to check my settings to make sure that I had it set to 480p instead of 480i.  For me, graphics in a Wii game don't have to be fancy, but the ragged edges are distracting.  Maybe on a smaller screen it would be less noticeable.  I posted some photos under the customer images, but it's kind of hard to see since they reduce the size here, but have a look anyway.

There are several options in the custom games that can be played with up to 5 players.  There's a Special Event where you can have from 2 to 13 $1,000,0000 cases.  There are also challenges in the 1 player mode like the Variety Ladder where your play one game of each special event type and try to win as much as you can, or Risky Business where you have to win increasingly larger amounts to keep playing.  In the Banker's Challenge you play 3 games in a row against computer opponents where the first game is against one, the second against 2 and the third against 3.  Again, you try to win as much as possible.

There are some mini games included such as Sharpshooter where you shoot the cases, Blackjack which plays like the card game but instead of 21 you're playing to $2,100 and instead of cards, you're dealt cases.  There's also a Marathon that has you playing each mini-game in random order, trying to score as much cash as you can.  It's probably good that they have the mini-games since playing Deal or No Deal would get boring after a while.

All in all, I think for the price it's a reasonably good game except I wish the graphics were more smoothly rendered.  I think it would be a good game at a party, even with only one player at a time because the interaction would make it more like the TV show.

My first thought when playing my first song was.. wow, this is sort of difficult for me to get straight in my head.  I played guitar for about 14 years and used to play some of the songs in the game.  The odd thing that happened though is the controller feels like a guitar but the the fingers on my left hand want to do something else!  Oddly enough, I unlocked the Slash video and hey said basically the same thing and I didn't feel so crazy anymore.  He said that the game would be much easier for someone that had never played guitar before!  I'll have to agree.  But the cool part is, its not that hard to overcome.  You'll just have problems playing on the medium settings.

On Easy, you basically can just look at the colored dots and match them up to your buttons.  The problem I had on the medium settings is many passages in songs only wanted me to take actions 1/2 the time, but my brain knew how the song went from playing it on real guitar and I had a really hard time not picking every note that was supposed to be there.  Expert however tends to make you do something for every note so that part at least is easier.  The issue I notice on expert though is, somehow those 5 little buttons are harder to play than 6 strings and 24 frets on a real guitar!  The last song, Metallica ""One"" I used to play on guitar, I tried on expert mode in Guitar Hero III and I couldn't even come close to doing it!

Just like real guitar, if you want to play in expert mode, you're going to have to practice every song many times to get it.  I actually had quite a bit more fun playing on easy, there were quite a few songs where I felt immersed into the song and had the feeling as if I were really playing it.. that was really cool!  Expert mode, well reminded me of the days of learning a new song on the guitar.. except using 5 buttons and a strum paddle.  I'll tell ya.. I wish i could just plug my Strat into the Xbox and just play that way.  I would start practicing guitar again for the first time in 10 years and I'd know more about what i'm doing.

Dont get what I said so far wrong.  The fun factor on this game is huge.  My roomate that never has played guitar in his life, in fact, never really plays video games at all got into this game.  I can actually picture having a party and people fighting over who's next on this thing.

My hopes are that Guitar Hero III will bring rock guitar back and to a new level and hopefully spawn a new generation of guitarists!  Anybody that likes rock music, is going to love this game.

I had a nice time just roaming around and watching the scenery.  The rides from city to city on the horses were alot of fun for me, but the Middle-Eastern names and storyline made it a little difficult for me to keep up with at first.  I really had to pay attention to know who was who.  Some subtitles would've been very helpful.  (Did I somehow miss those, because I sure did search)

Even though there are places to hide from guards, I never saw a reason to do it.  It was easy to kill them in large numbers without dying.  I think the game is too easy in that regard.  I had a few odd glitches also.  Sometimes Altair would freeze in battle while everyone else continuted on.  And there were times when horses would sink halfway into the ground when I approached them, or their hind legs would be stuck out horizontally.  If I sliced at them, they would run off with their legs still stuck in a horizontal position.  Very very odd.

4.0,True,"11 23, 2011",A1RL028B7L3BC1,B0053BQU4G,Mr. H,"Let me start off by saying that I have played every single Smackdown series game except for Smackdown 1, and SvR 2007. I've also played the N64 greats such as No Mercy and Wrestlemania 2000. I only say this so anyone looking at this review will know i'ts the real deal and not some random guy who picked up the game and wants to point out all the bad parts without saying what is good.

Starting off, this game is tough. I think it's partly due to me switching consoles. I had played all the original Smackdown games on PS2, then from 2008-2011 I was always on Xbox so going to PS3 kinda threw me off. I had a pretty hard time fighting normal and easy mode AI bots. After a few games I realized that I was using the D-Pad to move which is actually the taunt button, and I was using right stick for grapples which is actually the X button. Anyway, after getting used to all the controls this game got a lot more fun. My only gripe is that it is hard to do reversals, but i'm sure i'll get used to it as I play more. But my biggest dislike is the way you kick out of pins. You have to hold the X button to move up a meter and stop it on a precise spot on that meter to kick out. Sometimes i'll lose a match early just because I mess up on accident. Again i'm sure i'll get past that.

Another downside (for me, a fan of the attitude era) is the horrible roster. The only good people you start off with are Triple H, Undertaker, and Kane. I do have The Rock which is great, and I have also unlocked Steve Austin who is my favorite wrestler. I used to watch WWF/WWE every week back around 1999-2004 then stopped because it got boring. I have nothing against people who like John Cena or Randy Orton but personally I think they're just boring and overrated. I'm glad I get Steve and Rocky, but I'd like to have some of the other legends.

The graphics are great this year, i'm pretty impressed. They seemed to have not put much thought/effort into Steve Austin though. He is without a doubt the greatest WWF superstar of all time and should have had more effort put into him. There is just something about him that doesn't look right to me.

There are two ring announcers from what I can tell. One of them is alright, and the other one is TERRIBLE. I don't know how this guy got a job at WWE. I guess i'm just nostalgic for Howard Finkel.

All the little cons here and there aside, this is a great game. You just have to put the effort into getting used to the controls and it's smooth from there.

----Update 11/24/11

I've now had the chance to play this game a bit more. Reversals are starting to get a little easier, you just have to really anticipate the opponents move, requiring a bit of skill rather than just pushing a button constantly. Kicking out of pins is a little easier for me now too, but I find that later on in a game when your guy is worn down it is pretty hard to do the kick out. I just wish you could do some button pushing instead of ONLY using the meter system.

I looked over another review that said the AI bots are too easy. Playing a little more, I now play on the hardest difficulty which is legend. I do find it easier than the maximum difficulties of the other games, but this game has a cool little option that can fix this. You can go into the options and increase the AI abilities. By this I mean simple things like raising their percentage of reversing your moves, and other things that make the AI harder. I would assume if you max everything out then you would have an unstoppable AI force.

Online play is pretty smooth, the WWE '12 team posted an update today that said they're fixing server issues that are causing lag. I'm glad the team is working hard on this. As usual, there are player matches and ranked matches. It kinda sucks that with the millions of people who get this game, you'll only see like 15 servers up at a time for each section.  I really recommend you to play offline and learn all the controls and be able to beat legend mode computers before playing online. I lost a few matches online to horrible players just because they could reverse all my moves and I sucked at it.

Don't get me wrong, its not that Guitar Hero II was a complete flop, it just didn't feel as inspired as the original Guitar Hero; most of the songs were re-makes, and some of them were pretty lazy ones at that. I know quite a few Guitar Hero fans who were quite disappointed with the second installment, and I have to admit that Guitar Hero II had half the magic that Guitar Hero one had.

Well, there's a new Guitar Hero in town, and this one is bigger and better than the rest of 'em. Guitar Hero III boasts over 70 tracks including such hits as ""Bulls on Parade"" - by Rage Against the Machine, ""Black Magic Woman"" by Santana, ""When you were young"" by the Killers, ""Suck My Kiss"" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, ""Pride and Joy"" by Stevie Ray Vaughn and many more. A much better set list makes Guitar Hero III easily the best iteration yet, but the greatness doesn't stop there.

Guitar Hero III introduces the much anticipated and long overdue online play. Go head to head against a stranger in the new Battle Mode, or team up with a fellow rocker in online co-op.  The great thing about it is that there is minimal wait times; there is almost always someone ready to play either in battle match or the co-op.

The online interface is simple yet effective; you have a choice between Ranked and Player matches (ranked matches track your stats while player matches are for fun). The Player matches consist of Face-Off, Pro-Face Off, Co-OP and Battle. while  Ranked has all but the Co-op.

You can do a search for the first available match or you can create your own match. The ""join a quick match"" makes match finding easy, but you can also be nit-picky if you choose and set filters (difficulty, number of songs, type of match, ranked or player) for the search.

Like Guitar Hero II, when you are in a mutliplayer match with either a physical buddy or an online one, you can choose whether you want to play Bass guitar or Lead Guitar (and sometimes you get to pick Rhythm Guitar), and like Guitar Hero II you can each select your own difficulty (this especially comes in handy if you happen face off against someone who is a master of the Expert difficulty.

The control and star power are exactly the same as the last Guitar Hero, but for battle mode Red Octane has devised a cool gimmick. Instead of star power during a multiplayer battle ( or a boss battle, yes you get to battle ""bosses"" at the end of certain stages, like Slash from Guns N Roses and Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine), you can earn power-ups that you can use against your foe. You can break their guitar strings, force them to use their whammy bar, up their difficulty, wreck their amplifier or block the view of their fretboard, making it near impossible to see the notes for a small period of time. You can also force them to play left-handed (this just reverses the button order).

I picked up Guitar Hero III on Saturday and I have been playing it non-stop. Tracks like ""One"" by Metallica and ""Striken"" by Disturbed are strangely addicting; I've played through medium, most of hard and the beginning of Expert. Online competitive play encourages me to keep my practice up and gives me more than enough reasons to keep hoisting your trusty old axe atop your shoulders for ""one more go"". Oh, and there are achievements galore, and they are HARD! Some of the achievements are standard fare (score this many points, or beat this difficulty), but others are darn complicated; one achievement requires you to beat ""Through the Fire and Flames"" by Dragonforce on Expert. For those of you who do not know this song, it is probably one of the most complex and THE most fastest guitar shredding song in the world. There are over 1500 notes in that song alone, and they whiz by in a flurry of blinding speed.

Like the other Guitar Hero's before it, III has a store where you can upgrade your guitars, buy new guitars, buy new characters, songs, videos and a download link to Xbox Live (no downloadable content yet, but there will be soon).

My only gripe with this game is the over saturation of in-game advertising; familiar brand names and logos litter the environments. Lets see, Pontiac, Red Bull, Zabian, Guitar Center and Axe body spray, just to name a few. I guess its not all bad though, because most of the songs on Guitar Hero III are the actual song and not a re-make. I have a feeling that the in-game advertising and the profits from Guitar Hero I and II helped with that.

Amazingly, the game isn't just a drive around and do missions. It actually leaves you free to walk around and do things that will affect your business as a ""made-man"" with the Corleone family. Yes, you have to do the missions to keep the story moving but at the same time, you can ignore the missions and just go about doing other things to increase your ""business"" and contribute to the Corleone family. Take for example what I did in the game. I did about 50% of the missions and I decided to just clean-up Little Italy (where the Corleone family is based) from the Tattaglias; taking over these businesses, their warehouses.

One interesting mode in the game is the ""Mob War"" mode. This happens when you hit a crime family too much, they eventually declare a mob war with the Corleone family. Only to win a mob war is to either bomb one of their properties or pay an FBI agent to come down hard on the rival family. It's good fun really, and quite different. I usually bomb a place and then head to my apartment and let things calm down a bit. These fresh concepts  make this game quite unique in its way.

Speaking of families, you need to wrestle control of NY from all the other rival families. The biggest rival that you'll be pitted against is the Barzini family who owns Manhattan. By the way, the game recreates an almost perfect replica of New York, even the streets are accurate. I know because I'm from NYC. One trick I did to test the accuracy was fifth avenue and madison ave. Fifth avenue is just across Madision ave, which is correct in the game. Canal St. and Mott St. are real streets in NY, with Canal St. being Chinatown today.

Going back to what I am doing now with the game, I've basically knocked out Tattaglia from NY. Only thing left is go to and overrun his family compound. One important tip if you're planning to buy this game. The moment you get about $16,000 in the game, buy yourself the most expensive shoes, suits, hat, and glasses. These accessories give Bonus Respect points on your character. Very important if you want to get that extra boost of respect points to get to the top.

So is this game worth it? Yes definitely. If you are into mobster-themed games, look no further. This is almost almost real-life. By the way, prepare to die a lot in this game. This game is not easy. Be patient and keep buying those safehouses all over NY.

The main character only has one weapon and a few items which most of which repeat themselves in a pattern throughout the entire game.
There are no side quests or red herrings to keep you intrigued, no easter eggs.

Keeping with the original Romance of Three Kingdoms (hai shi DW Three Kingdoms' new book The Greatest of Heroes) novel, they've made a game that brings incredible feelings of joy in playing through its characters in a totally new world to which say only Dynasty Warriors 3 can compare.

The new fighting systems, graphical environments AND their details eg shape of the land and interactivity, and enemy AI, all make the game something we've been waiting half a decade for.

It is truly beautiful - with 3rd gen console quality cutscenes (and real voice actors now!) the story is vividly retold, threading together the historical battles of ROTK (half the reason for the games' popularity and KOEI's success!). With this formula reinvigorated, KOEI should now win over millions more to its series with the Chinese story, which have complemented each others fame in recent years.

The combo ""Renbu"" system is a nice change, allowing more powerful attacks as you show your skill rather than button mashing ability, and the game allows enough foes on screen for it to become worthwhile.

Having a new skill system, although copied from other games, is one of the wisest ideas KOEI has had. The warhorse and weapon development are some of the ways that makes the games' time consumption feel more worthwhile, but the only critisiscm is still just that - time consumption. It's a long game (but based on a very long story! - ROTK is 3x as long as Lord of the Rings!) and with dozens of characters to play through and level up, its one that can accomodate the casual player but even better the DW/ROTK addict.

So overall, an incredible game - the kind we've been waiting for.

I'd give it 9/10 - the best since DW3.

The chinese online version is still the kind we are waiting for however - where the mechanics and joy of Dynasty Warriors can be applied against HUMAN opponents - but until then this will suffice.

In the meantime however, DW Three Kingdoms has also released their new book, based on the same story as Dynasty Warriors, and is a great compliment one of the best games of 2008.","Finally, a Dynasty Warriors worth buying and playing through!!",1203638400,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

I created a character, which took like 30 minutes, then it took me 3 more hours to make the house like I wanted. Then it took like an hour to figure out cheats and how to play better. Then My character meets somebody, falls in love, then it turns out that that character has a dream goal of breaking as much hearts as he can.

There isn't a huge leap like from Uncharted 1 to 2, but what makes Uncharted 4 standout from 3 is the graphics, combat variation, and more natural character interaction whether its from Nathan Drake talking to other people or mumbling to himself through his adventure instead of making a lot of one liners.

Graphics one of the best on PS4 so far. Very life like especially with the grass/leaves growing around and out of buildings. They always seem to pop when traversing the landscape. The animation and movement of the characters are very organic to how Nathan lands on his feet after a jump or miss jump to the slight body movements when he tries to get back on balance when someone shoves him from the back or shoulder.

Story revolve around Nathan Drake's brother coming back in his life, and asking for help to find a hidden lost treasure. There's a lot more cutscenes and introspection in terms of story telling compared to previous games. The pacing is a bit out of place and there a lot of highs and lows in terms of action sequences, flash backs, puzzle segments and level traversal. Instead of sprinkling them out, they tend to do it more in bulk in this game, which sort of discourages binge gaming.

Gameplay. Instead of scaling up buildings to reach the next destination every time, there's awesome wide traversal in the game making it a nice change of pace with a larger view of the world instead of a narrow upward momentum in past games. There's a new rope swing mechanic where you wall walk and swing around corners with enhances exploration.

Seeing the wider open landscape there's more options to attack your enemies during combat segments as you no longer have to fight through narrow corridors and feel trapped, hiding behind boxes while you constantly shoot a bullet sponges. Now to can easily flank and traverse around characters as well as stealth kill you way to the next checkpoint without initiating a breakout fight. The AI use the larger levels to their advantage as well, so the game encourage you keep moving instead of staying in one fixed location.

There are vehicle traversal segments to switch things up a bit, but I find the vehicle controls horrible and should have been omitted from the game, but the landscape you ride around has really nice vistas. Just that tight corners and narrow passages ways kills the mood when driving in them.

Partner AI is very good in this game. They react to your overall intent whether it's stealth taking out your enemies or letting you crawl pass them when climbing buildings.

Online is similar to Uncharted 3's multiplayer except  there's a supernatural element to it where you can use items called mysticals to call in snipers, pin point all enemies on the map, and teleport among other skills.

Trophies are similar to past games: do certain actions/use weapons a set amount of times, collect relics, complete game on variety of difficulty settings. etc. If you tried trophy hunting in Uncharted 1-3 it will feel familiar to you.

Marvel VS. Capcom 3 breaks into the scene facing a great deal of expectations and anticipation, and in most aspects it delivers, but unfortunately it falls just a bit short of being the spectacular game it could have been.

The gameplay and general mechanics are essentially a mishmash of those from both Marvel VS. Capcom 2 and Tatsunoko VS. Capcom. You're given three characters and a series of four core buttons to work with, those being Light, Medium, Heavy and Special attacks. This closely resembles the setup of TVC, simplifying things a bit from the punch and kick commands of MVC; a wise move, given that it generally trims the fat of the previous game's complexity.

The Assists, Hyper Combos, crossovers and many other advanced tactics all return, but there are a handful of new alterations and quirks. For one, unlike TVC, there is no Mega Crash (although it is possible to break away from certain long combos) or Baroque; instead, there's the X Factor, a completely new tactic that may only be used once per match. X Factoring allows each of your characters a brief speed and power boost, along with gradual health recovery. These effects are strengthened depending on how many of your 3 characters are remaining (it is at its maximum if you only have one character left). This occasionally adds an interesting element to the gameplay, but many have argued that it's an unnecessary feature which can unfairly turn the tide of a fight, and there is definitely some validity to this complaint. Adding to the imbalance of this is the fact that different characters receive different boosts, leading to some characters gaining ridiculous power boosts while others don't really become much more of a threat.

Switching out, or swapping characters, is unfortunately now a sorely obnoxious task, requiring the player to press and hold the Partner button until their other character appears; mistakenly tapping the button will cause a crossover Assist, and as many veteran players know, initiating an Assist when you're intending to switch out can cost you a character, or worse, a match. Needless to say, this can take a bit of getting used to, particularly for those accustomed to the simple back+/Partner command that came before.

`Simple mode' from TVC also returns, allowing a significantly simplified control scheme in which special moves and Hyper Combos can be more easily initiated. This may sound unappealing or unfair to those more willing to adjust to the traditional controls, but simple mode also disallows certain attacks and abilities, so it's more of a tradeoff than a wholehearted handicap; it's ultimately a more accessible and user-friendly version of the control scheme.

The roster has been among the most debated-over aspects of the game; MVC2 had a whopping 56 characters to choose from, while so far MVC3 only offers 36. Granted, unlike MVC2, you'll find no recycled sprites here; each and every character is brought to vivid new life and design. Many staples and favorites return, so fans of Ryu, Wolverine, Morrigan, Storm, and many others won't be complaining. Devil May Cry's Dante and X-Men's Deadpool are among some of the exciting new additions, while a surprising number of more obscure fan favorites also managed to make the cut. Some of the exclusions are rather upsetting, however, particularly the lack of Venom, certain X-Men characters and most shocking of all, Capcom's flagship character Mega Man. There's more downloadable content to come, however, so we'll have to see what the game's future has to offer.

Some of the game's modes and single-player options are more disappointing than others; the online mode is overall pretty satisfying so far, allowing players to either log on for a quick match with a random player or friend, or join a lobby of several players in a sort of informal tournament system. Players can `friend' opponents they'd like to play again and even speak to one another through console-compatible microphones. Lag is generally minimal or non-existent, and thankfully you'll be forewarned of the connection strength in the lobbies before joining. There are also of course leaderboards and rankings for the best of the best, but you can only gain ranks through random Quick Matches, and sadly there's no spectator option; this is particularly frustrating when you're waiting around for your next match in the lobbies.

The single-player modes aren't quite as satisfying. MVC3 has a rather standard Arcade mode which features nothing but a series of random battles followed by a boss fight and usually anticlimactic ending sequence which differs by character but is merely a brief series of still pictures and text. The end-game credits are nice the first time you watch them, but they're the same regardless of which character you win with, and therefore aren't nearly as interesting the second, third or fourth time around. Super Smash Bros. Brawl's Subspace Emissary wasn't what a lot of people were hoping for, but it was more engaging than what's offered here. Although the Arcade mode serves its generic purpose, a few more cutscenes or character-specific individuality would've made it really worthwhile.

MVC3's biggest asset is it succeeds in a few of the key areas where both TVC and MVC2 failed. TVC offered an overly simplified control option which occasionally allowed for disproportionate advantages, and yet was oftentimes preferable to the needlessly complex alternative. MVC3 manages to find a healthy balance between MVC2's ice-cold complexity and TVC's desperate attempt at accessibility; both regular and simple mode in MVC3 are useable without being cheaply advantageous or impossible to understand. Although deeply advanced tactics will be reserved for deeply skilled players, as they always have been, most players will gain a deeper understanding of the control schemes offered here more quickly than they would have in MVC2.

Unfortunately, as expected, opportunities to be cheap present themselves in MVC3 just as they do in most fighting games. Thankfully only a small handful of the characters seem genuinely broken or overpowered, but the ones that are can be truly frustrating to go up against; both Sentinel and Iron Man can fill the screen with enormous and heavily damaging beams and projectiles, while Phoenix becomes virtually impossible to approach, let alone defeat, once she transforms into Dark Phoenix. Ryu spammers are also expectedly back in action, but thankfully so far it doesn't seem quite as common as it was in TVC.

The game has a visual style that is distinctly American and heavily influenced by comic books; as where MVC2's artwork and aesthetics felt more authentically Japanese, this game comes off as though it belongs a little more to Marvel than it does to Capcom. This works both for and against it; most of the Marvel characters look amazing, and several of the Capcom ones do as well, although the heavy Americanization of the likes of Tron Bonne and Morrigan can come off as a bit wonky at first. Aside from that, however, the visuals are vivid and gorgeous; one thing you'll never be bored with is what goes on onscreen during matches.

Although the complaints may have seemed heavy, MVC3 is in fact a very entertaining and visually appealing game; the online mode is extremely fun and engaging, and some of the downloadable content to come, namely the new characters and complete costume revamps, seem very promising. Tuning up the roster and 1-player mode-adding more modes in general, for that matter-would have really made it nothing short of excellent, but here's hoping they really take popular demand into consideration for DLC.","Great game, but not entirely what it could have been",1298073600,39,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

...but some years have passed.  I have revisited the dark tale in order to once again discover its brilliance.  But the simple truth is that ""Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem"" is a product of its time, and was put on its pedestal way too soon.

I am not writing this review to simply analyze the videogame's faults.  Frankly, there are ton of 5-star games available on Amazon that are well worth your time and money in spite of their flaws.  But with ""Eternal Darkness"", you must tread carefully.  You are reading the reviews of memories, not the review of the game as it is in 2009.

I guess the best summary I can give you is that for every great idea in ""Eternal Darkness"", there's always some sort of caveat to remind you that you're holding a controller in your hand.  So, my personal review is going to be a ""This Is Good, But"" kind of review.  Let's bullet-point this one, shall we?

* The game's combat is much simpler and easier than most survival-horror games.  You will often control a sword, or other form of blade, with the occasional pistol or projectile thrown in.  Frankly, the guns are worthless.  The game will quickly teach you how to take down your enemies.  BUT ""better"" doesn't mean ""great"".  The combat leaves much to be desired.  Even with the magic system (more on that later) implemented in the later stages of the game, you are still hacking and slashing some pretty boring-looking foes.

* ""Eternal Darkness"" is famous for its sanity effects.  Whenever your character is spotted by the enemy, you slowly lose your sanity, which can eventually lead to some very frightening moments.  I'll leave those moments for you to discover, which I'm sure are on YouTube in case you wanna pass the game up.  BUT, other than eventually harming your health, these sanity effects get old once you've seen them.  The only way to really enjoy them is to deliberately delay killing your enemies.  Some may get a delightful cackle from going nuts, but it's not THAT genius when you think about it.

* The game uses a magic system in order to not only enhance combat, but to solve some nifty puzzles.  As the game progresses, you learn more spells, and can make them more powerful.  There's even a Ro-Sham-Bo kinda system to the magic.  BUT, learning the spells is kinda cheap.  In order to create spells, you need Runes.  In order to use the runes, you need to decode them.  Learning the spells requires little to no thought whatsoever, because you learn them by just searching for different pieces throughout the stages.  Because you take little part in creating the spells, learning them is tedious.

* ""Eternal Darkness"" has a mythology and story that spans centuries.  You will play as various characters who've encountered a supernatural evil, leading to moments of sheer horror.  BUT this method of storytelling means you only get a brief adventure with the characters.  Their histories, their dreams, their motivations, their effects in time...you will learn less than you hope.  It becomes very apparent that main character Alexandra Roivas is merely someone who just finds their different stories in her family mansion.  You want to know more about how her grandfather was mysteriously & gruesomely murdered.  Instead, you begin reading the stories of others, waiting a long time before Alex is personally involved.

* The game featured some great graphics for its time.  The levels in particular look pretty sharp even today.  I never understood the criticisms for ""Resident Evil"" graphical presentation, because it immerses you in artistic creation.  The environments (except for the Persian desert) are uniformly strong.  BUT, the character models aren't consistently good.  Some look amazing in closeup, while people look blocky.  Some are very well-animated in their movements, while others move like constipated apes.  Even the corpses aren't consistently drawn well.

* Sound plays a major role in this game, and it's the only near-perfect element in the game.  The music is subtle and minimal.  The screams are terrifying.  The shocks are heart-stopping.  The voice-acting is excellent.  The weapons sound good.  The creatures are intimidating.  What's most remarkable is the background & surround effects.  Early in the game, you're in a monestary where if you approach an office, you can hear a muttered secret meeting taking place.  Other than maybe the Roivas mansion's ""gong-gong"" rhythm, I've no complaints here.

* The game has three different endings.  BUT, the differences are mostly cosmetic, and minimal at best.  Finishing all three versions of the quest will unlock the ultimate ending for the game, but the drive to complete the game three times is questionable.

* ""Eternal Darkness"" has some good scares in it, some of them ""BOO"" moments, others just disturbing.  BUT, while disturbing moments leave long impressions, this game is only as scary as you want it to be.  Once you go through the jump-out-of-your-seat moments, you're not likely to be scared on your second playthrough.  And going back to the sanity effects, only you are in control of how mad your character gets.  Sadly, there are only a few moments when the player doesn't control the sanity...those are the best surprises.

I first played ""Eternal Darkness"" in July 2002.  I thought it was extraordinary.  If I had done an official review, I probably would've said 9.5 out of 10.  To this day, most critics' reviews average out to that score.

A few years later, I popped the game back in.  I finished the game, but somewhat reluctantly so.  I put the game aside, and told myself, ""Maybe I'm just not in the right frame of mind to enjoy this fully.  Another time, perhaps.""  After all, some great games can't be played on a regular basis, and need time to grow in your memories before you revisit them.

So, now it's 2009.  I have tried a third time to play ""Eternal Darkness"" from start to finish.  About halfway through, I have decided to stop.  It's just not that fun anymore.

There is nothing shameful about a videogame that pioneered a genre years ago, and has fallen by the wayside.  Our memories are real.  We really did enjoy the worlds, tales, and experiences that ""Eternal Darkness"" gave us years ago.  But it's time to acknowledge that its core value as a videogame is diminished.

If I may quickly sidestep, one of my all-time favorite series is the ""Metal Gear Solid"" franchise.  Those have much more emphasis on story & cinemas than they do on actual gameplay.  But the differences is that those stories are brilliant, a pleasure to revisit, and the gameplay itself holds up in the time passed.  ""Eternal Darkness"", on the other hand, has a good story that isn't worth playing through.  I loved the end, but don't like getting there anymore.

""Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem"" belonged on its pedestal in 2002.

4.0,False,"04 17, 2016",AHL35XZ3OND2Z,B00Z9LUFHS,Amazon Customer,"Dark Souls 1 is hard to match.  It was not only a subtle improvement over the systems and design of Demon's Souls, it was this huge, intertwined word to explore.  When the game is over, much of what stays with you in Dark Souls was the atmosphere and the feeling of going on a journey. I never got that from Dark Souls 2.  The 60 FPS Scholar of the First Sin release made the game a lot smoother to play, but there were some gaping design problems. Even after 100+ hours, I never warmed to the trash mob design philosophies or world design. Also, F*** the Fume Knight. Seriously though, Dark Souls 2 may have been HUGE and challenging, but it just wasn't as charming or fun as the original. And why were backstabs so hard to pull off? Dark Souls 3 knows this.

The Bloodborne influence is evident early on. The game simply LOOKS like Bloodborne - mostly for the better. Enemy placement is far more thoughtful and the game controls far better, faster even. The backstab is now a cinch to do most of the time, even on some bosses. And the bosses are mostly good too, if not quite original. This is a sequel after all and for better or worse, there are TONS of Dark Souls 1 callbacks. TONS, I tell you. The Bloodborne DNA is mostly welcome, but there are some things missing.  Yharnam, like Lordran before it, was a giant sweeping and intertwined place of mystery.  It felt lived in.  There were signs of other days long past.  You walked among not just ruins, but places where things actually happened.  Lothric easily trumps Drangleic in this atmospheric respect, particularly in High Wall and Undead Settlement. Overall though, variety is missing here.  This is a great sequel and the gameplay is better than it has ever been and that alone is worth the price of admission.  But the world isn't quite as interesting and the bosses not nearly as surprising.  Dark Souls 3 is a much better game than Dark Souls 2.  But it isn't quite as good as Bloodborne or the original.  This is like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: Missing the magic from the original, but a solid improvement over Temple of Doom.

Some notes:

- Beat it. Missing only Nameless King fight to clear out. Completely satisfying, but slightly shorter than Bloodborne overall.

- Having the game both on PC and PS4, crashes aside, the PC version plays vastly superior.  The 60FPS frame-rate make combat far more satisfying.  Get this one if you have the choice.

- Summon co-op occasionally makes for easier boss fights, but it also makes Dark Souls 3 more fun to play.  Don't think you're ""Cheating"" by bringing in a phantom or playing the phantom helper yourself. Teamwork has it's own rewards.  Co-op leads to many tense and often hilarious encounters topped off with some emote banter.

- Some boss mechanics are recycled in a few places, particularly with the duo encounters.  Also having a boss recharge their health meter mid fight isn't fun.
- Rings and covenant grinding for trophies is pretty tedious.  Just outright boring really. Chances are I'm going to just bail on the Platinum grind.  I got my money's worth.

EDIT:  Three, playthroughs down on two systems.  A level 134 character on NG+ and someday I may get that Dark Soul achievement.  Dark Souls 3 was worth the time - with some network glitches that have popped up.  Occasionally if you are summoned for a boss fight, you walk around like a statue and take no damage from the boss while pummeling them with DPS.  It's a weird glitch I think is down to network lag.  Only have seen it two or three times, but should be addressed.  Kind of takes the wind out of a fight if it takes no effort to win.

Final EDIT:  Six clears. 200+ hours. Hanging it up on DS3. 88% trophy completion. I just don't have the heart to clear the PvP grind for spells and another NG run for rings.  By far most value of any game this year. My time was respected and it was fun and far less frustrating than I remember DS2.

5.0,False,"11 29, 2004",A15UXO3PDUOGJY,B00008KTNW,Ironblayde,"Imagine: you round a corner, minding your own business, when suddenly you're faced with three guards, swords on their backs and automatics in their hands, ten meters away. How unfortunate... for them. You effortlessly intercept the incoming arms fire with your sword as you rapidly close the distance, and drive your assailants back with a flurry of blows delivered almost too quickly to follow. You take to the air then, and savage your opponents with a barrage of precisely aimed shurikens as you pass overhead. Finally, you stride off the wall twice, bringing you behind the three, and as you turn, your sword screams around in a lethal arc, decapitating all three of your hapless attackers with a single, fell stroke. By the time you hit the ground, you're the only one left alive. Elapsed time: six seconds. Sound impossible? Not if you're a ninja.

The above is only one example of the countless spectacular feats you'll find yourself performing as Ryu, the protagonist of Ninja Gaiden. It took less than a minute for me to become obsessed with this game, as I learned how Ryu could flip through the air, stride up and across walls, dance across the surface of water, perform all manner of aerial acrobatics, and of course, deal out death in any way you can name, and more than a few that you can't. Playing the part of Ryu is wonderfully fun, and with the intuitive control scheme, it's surprisingly easy to get into as well.

The game's visuals are astounding, some of the best I've seen on the XBox. Its numerous and diverse locales are all very convincingly rendered, as are the various characters that populate them, making for a highly immersive experience. Everything clips along at an excellent frame rate as well, with nary a moment of slowdown to be found, even when you're fighting five guys at once and they're breaking out the incendiary shurikens. The sound effects and the score are excellent as well, spanning a wide variety of themes and always fitting the game perfectly. The voice acting could have been a little better, perhaps, but it's not bad... certainly it's no Resident Evil, so you needn't fear on that count.

One thing a lot of people have mentioned about the game is that it's quite difficult, and it is, but I count that as a point in its favor. Ninja Gaiden gets the challenge factor just right, in my opinion: it's challenging enough that it will require real skill, and multiple attempts at some of its harder battles, but not so challenging that the difficulty detracts from the fun of it. One need only have a little patience, and before long you'll be handling multiple foes and stringing complex combos together like you've been doing it your whole life.

With a superb array of weapons to employ, a numberless horde of foes to engage, a fine variety of secrets and extras to discover and unlock, and such a wonderful world to play in, I'm hard-pressed to imagine what more one could want from an action game.

Being able to play though it really makes it fun for me. Plus, I love all the achievements I can get during the game play.

I was actually able to play through this game one time and because I didn't do so well on questioning in the beginning I can play though again and try to answer the questions correctly.

To put it short: Cars fan? Buy this. Not a Cars fan? Nothing here for you.

Let's face it, young or old, you don't buy a CARS game expecting Gran Turismo. You buy a CARS game because you like the characters, and you enjoy the unique experience of racing around in a living, breathing (they don't have lungs, but they definitely inhale and exhale) automobile while other vehicles taunt you and Doc Hudson offers encouragement over the radio. In what other race game can you play as an aging Sheriff car who--as the race begins--sighs, ""Am I getting too old for this sort of race? I sure hope not."" Then, after pulling off a tight maneuver, chuckles ""I didn't know I could still do that!"" and, upon winning, declares ""Sit-choo-ation is under control."" (Or, in a loss, grumps, ""This is a complete and total disgrace!"") These cars have personalities. Their mood changes depending on their place in the race, they whoop with joy when catching big air, and they yelp when they hit obstacles. THAT is why ya buy a CARS game, and this game delivers that element in great generous heaps of humor and fun.

If you're a huge fan of the movie, you'll enjoy this game a lot. You'll just learn to avoid the problem areas and spend more time with the sections that work great.

PROS:

* Better controls this time around--Wii Wheel works great with this one.
* Sheriff's a playable racer again!
* Sharp graphics
* Radiator Springs Speedway is a fantastic track & environment.
* Tons of gameplay.
* Huge environments to explore.
* The banter between cars is as entertaining as ever.
* Power Boost and Backwards Driving available from start.
* Some fun new characters (Bubba's awesome).
* Slick menus.

CONS:

* Framerate gets AWFUL when many cars are ahead of you in busy environments. This is, by far, the game's worst flaw. Stay in first place, and it's not an issue!
* Terrible pop-in scenery in Tailfin Pass area. Ugly, ugly trees will appear just yards ahead of you. And you'll wish they'd just stayed unseen.
* Story's not very compelling. The generic little cars that make up the competing schools are not very interesting as playable characters.
* Sound glitches crop up during Pre and Post-race info windows--these moments have a rough, unpolished feel to them.
* Still no replay camera feature.

That framerate issue will be the deal-breaker for a lot of players. It's very inconsistent, and seems to depend on how hard the environment is pushing the Wii's limits. The opening races on Radiator Springs Speedway play fairly smoothly, while later areas like Tailfin Pass and Santa Carburera suffer greatly. If you stay out if front, no problem. If more than three or four cars get ahead of you, prepare for framerate chaos. I guess you could view that as your punishment for racing poorly! Despite those problems--and the terrible pop-in trees in Tailfin Pass--the game, in general, looks great. The cars are detailed and sport nifty reflective effects, and everything has a sharp, detailed, colorful look. I wish the developers had been given more time to tweak the game engine to run more smoothly on Wii--maybe dropping some detail to save the frame rate during crowded situations, and redesigning Tailfin Pass, which is clearly asking more of the Wii than the poor little white box can pull off.

 BUT...and here's the good news...IF you can overlook those cringe-inducing moments, there's still a ton of fun to be had in this installment of the Cars franchise, because most of the game plays well, looks great, and delivers all the charm and personality you're looking for in a Cars game.

Besides, the framerate isn't always an issue. Most circuit races play fine, Free Driving is a pleasure, and the Rustbucket and Monster Truck races are entertaining and smooth, as are the fun little Guido Kart mini races and Sheriff's chase. Another trick is to switch to first-person camera, which not only increases the framerate, but provides a genuinely thrilling sense of speed.

There you go, no need to read further. You're wasting valuable playing time.

For those with a bit more of an attention span: Game of the Year --- because ---

While it seems at first glance that Fallout 3 might just be Oblivion reskinned, spending a little time with this game will dispell that notion completely. Yes, it's made by Bethesda and if you've played their earlier RPGs Morrowind and Oblivion you will see a lot of similarities and will definitely feel right at home with this game. But the similarities quickly fade into mere recognizable structural convention as the player begins to see that there is a rather stout and unexpected FPS mixed with their RPG.

Okay RPG players it's not going to be all mindless or super difficult finger twitching gun battles --- you are thinkers --- well the VATS system is only one button away and you can take a half an hour to pick a limb, body, or head shot if that's how you wish to play. All the strategy of leveling up, what powers to get, weapons to get, and what armor etc. are still there --- there's even a very lite version of co-op play if you find the right characters.

And to the skeptical FPS players --- I've played 'em all --- all the Halo games, Far Cry, Bioshock etc. etc. etc. --- whatever --- and this is as smooth and solid as any of those games as a shooter. I repeat, smooth and solid. But when you want a little extra sauce on your kills, once again, the VATS system is the answer for you as well. Very satisfying slow motion ultra-gory head explosions and full utilization of the Havoc psychics engine are just a button push away. Really that's nothing but pure fun.

This is an extremely detailed and fascinating world that is brought to life with great care, ambition, and talent. Also, as simple and predictible as the story might be, I found myself actually following it and often being amused by it instead of completely ignoring it on my way to the next action sequence. I swear, I have no idea what's going on in Halo for example --- nor do I care.

And lastly, for the Fallout 1 and 2 players --- you probably won't think anything will be as good as those games. But really this game has captured a lot of the flavor those games --- while attaining a very next generation playability --- besides we need to move into this century now. Here's a tissue.

Bethesda, Nice effort on this outstanding game and also on the excellent collectors edition --- cool bobble, art book, video, and lunch box. My favorite CE so far.",Oblivion Reskinned or Game of the Year,1228176000,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,True,"05 4, 2005",AR7HOO02LJAAI,B0002RQ3H0,JS,"This game is a blast!

Graphics: The graphics of the girl wrestlers are the best I've seen of computer woman anywhere. They claim they used 10,000 polygons per character, and it shows; whole body frame moves from breathing, breasts sway, hair flows, you can even see the fat on their bodies. Its hard to believe this is done on a PS2. One disappointment is the mud pit (which is more like muddy water) but they got the most important thing right, the girls. I just wish that they had included a bigger variety of body types; a few women who were a little older or maybe a little heavier would have been interesting.

Wrestling: The game works well and is a lot of fun. Some people have complained about the low number of moves, but actually each girl has dozens of moves, because the most of the holds and throws have a different effect when you are moving, or just after an evasion move, etc. The only problem is that the reversals are damn near impossible to pull off, and since you can't rotate the camera in a match, sometimes its hard to see the game properly. The game tracks your energy to pull off special moves, your body damage, and your ""humiliation"" rating. It can seem complicated, but you can ignore all that if you want to. Just wrestle the best you can, and the rest takes care of itself.

Arenas: There are only 4 different arenas to choose from (including the mud pit). A few more venues would have been nice. Except for the mud itself, the arenas look great.

Story: As others have said, the story mode is badly acted and quite ridiculous, but the dialogue is funny so I didn't care. You have to take it with a sense of humor. Each wrestler's story is a little short, but since there are 20 or so wrestlers to go through, there is a huge amount of gameplay here.

Also, the game uses a very nice feature, where, by using certain moves in a ""vow"" system, you can change the face/heel rating of your wrestler, in effect, turning toward good or evil. This changes the personality, costume, wrestling moves, and story for each character. My favorite is the schoolteacher who can be unlocked as a dominatrix.

Extras: Since the women are so gorgeous, there is a gallery mode where you can rotate the camera and zoom in and zoom out while the women stretch out and answer interview questions. Its something that didn't have to be added, and its actually pretty cool.

Entrance: This is something I haven't seen anyone else comment on yet. Each wrestler has a different entrance number before her match. Most of these are incredible, and worth watching all by themselves. The best is Becky the cheerleader (the good version of Candy). You can turn these off if you get tired of them.

Bottom line: This game is not simply a gimmick. Beyond the gorgeous women, there is a real wrestling game here loaded with extras. There is a lot of depth to this game that's not readily apparent if you only get it as a rental.",FUN is the word,1115164800,7,,

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"Wario and co. have always shown us what kinds of interesting ways our Nintendo consoles could be used for. In WarioWare Twisted, we saw how cool it was to tilt the Game Boy Advance to shave a guy's beard or guide a ball to a gap. In Touched, we used the stylus to scratch backs, tap buttons, and the mic to blow away Fronks when we weren't supposed to. In Smooth Moves, we used the Wii Remote in all sorts of weird ways (even positioning it by our noses!) and antics like dancing, balancing, shooting, etc. In Game & Wario? We are only given around a dozen demonstrations.

This is because Game & Wario is supposedly a WarioWare ""spin-off"" deviating from the 5-second quirkiness of hundreds of microgames and instead diving into minigames that last minutes. Think each one as a boss microgame in a traditional WarioWare game, except playing each one individually makes for more potential to be fun. You can shoot arrows at baddies, go skiing, take pictures of suspects, and jump from foothold to foothold.

While most of these minigames can be fun in their own right (But not without a few duds), the single player campaign leaves you playing the first level of each one. It doesn't take long before you reach the end of it. During my playthrough, I went ""Wait...That was it?!"" when I saw the credits screen.

That's not to say Game & Wario is a mediocre game. What keeps it from that territory are the games that are truly fun to play when you play them individually, as well as the multiplayer minigames, which never disappoint when it comes to intense hijinks with family and friends!

My only real problem with it is that for that price you'd hope that the quality of the hardware would be better than that. It looks (and probably is) made out of cheap plastic (it's not a big surprise that one of my ear cups broke off after just a year...)
But Tritton makes up for it with an awesome customer support (they are going to replace my broken headset even though I'm 3 months out of the warranty limit ! Way to go Tritton, I wish more hardware makers were like you...)

Pros: real surround sound, compatibility across the board, remote on the wire, awesome support from Tritton (on the phone), two sets of ear-pads, pre-amp that has secondary output for another surround sound system ! (this is so awesome to have)
Cons: sound quality isn't the best but as good as the average headset, quality of the plastic, the mic barely adjust, mic sound quality isn't the best either.

To conclude this headset isn't the perfect headset but for my use of it (online gaming) it's the best I could find out there. (and I love the fact that I don't have to switch between my surround speakers and the headset, I can even listen to both if I want to !)

The Wii U, when first revealed, had a majority of hate from typical gamers of today. But I liked it. I could already see the potential within this new Console and Controller, the screen acting as a scope for a gun, the map always available but never taking up part of the screen. I was excited.

I waited, read various reports (bad and good) and saved for Nintendos next gen gaming machine.

and Finally the day arrived.

I got the Wii U! I was stoked, I rushed home, plugged the controller in to charge, waited for the light to disappear and started the system.

I was in awe. Of course the next task was the update (which I have grown use to owning a ps3) So I had to wait even longer... but it was worth it.

after setting up my account I quickly popped Nintendo land in and I was in heaven.

Nintendo land Like wii sports basically showed off what the new system is capable of. And my gosh! I was in love, the different ways the controller was used... my mind was blown. Nintendo never seems to fail me in terms of recreating the magic of video games every chance they get. I even rushed out the next day to pick up Zombiu and later in the week downloaded Mario U.

Now I have heard many complain about this system... but I guess nobody realizes that the system ""just"" came out. The ports seem to be poor, but given the fact that the developers didn't have nearly the time they had when developing said ports when they made them for the ps3 360, I'm surprised how good they turned out. And after playing Nintendo land and seeing the true potential this system could have, it makes me look at the ps3 and I can tell it's last gen.

So don't let the constant complainers fool you. This system is amazing. Also, take into account that Nintendo is reaching out to the ""hardcore"" crowd and even created an appstore of there own that is easy to develop for. that's a sign they are even interested in indie developers.

  Hyrule is a kingdom that's always in trouble, and its up to Link to save the land from a terrible enemy.  Link has the help of Navi, a fairy that gives you advice or tells you what you should do next.
  During his adventures, Link will learn spells, be swallowed by a huge fish, and saving the land from the evil Ganondorf.  This game is a classic and worth the money.",A timeless classic!,1018396800,10,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

He's very much like Luke Skywalker, who receives a lightsaber and suddenly possesses a power which enables him to destroy every vestige of evil in the universe!  Raiden, like many other hollywood heros, is unsuprisingly, a pathetic joke. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's tired of game developers producing young, inexperienced, moronic heros, guided by the belief that gamers will be able to relate to them better. If that was true, then why is MGS 1's hero, 40 year old Solid Snake, the most revered hero in computer game history? Now, I understand that Snake couldn't have been used for this game due to the storyline, but still, I would have preferred someone who was less submissive, who could be perceived as strong, and who wasn't a girl which Radien arguably is! Since Raiden is essentially a pathetic joke, it's hard to believe that he's the hero they make him out to be.

Many people hated the MGS2 storyline, but I think the story could be percieved as fascinating by some or absurdly bizarre by the rest.  I suppose the nearest thing it could be equated to are those conspiracy theories that you find on the web, like massive underground alien bases, LSD experiments, mind control experiments, etc... If you're a fan of that stuff, then you'll probably find the storyline interesting.

Other than Raiden and the storyline, the game is pretty good.  The gamplay, the innovations, the graphics (unexampled still) and the AI can't be faulted, it's just that some might feel that Raiden and the storyline have pulled this game down into the s******. The game's lengh is a problem too. But that's about it! All in all, the game is good, but it's nowhere near as good as MGS 1.",The actual game's excellent!,1097798400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"01 2, 2014",A36QNRQGBFKC5Q,B002BRUTT2,Alan R,"I play video games for their story and here is my top five now that I've finished Nier:

1.  Xenogears
2.  Xenosaga series
3.  Nier
4.  Planescape: Torment
5.  Final Fantasy X

This game is a MASTERPIECE when it comes to the story and never have I seen a game tell its story the way Nier does.  Basically you play through the game, then have the opportunity to play through it again.  And playing through it again is NOT just the same story with a different ending, prepare to have your eyes opened and to be hit in the gut ad you experience it all from a new perspective.  It's very emotional and amazing.

So I made it clear, the story of Nier is original and incredible.  What about everything else?  Well, the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard and the voice acting it out of this world.  Not everything is as amazing though.  The world is kind of small and there is a LOT of back tracking through the same locations over and over.  The side quests can be a terrible grind for little reward, but some of them tell great stories too so it's worth it to push through.  The game isn't perfect, but the story is so good this game MUST be played.

And I will say this final statement:  If you put in the time to play through Nier once and watch the final credits, you are doing yourself the ULTIMATE disservice if you do not do the Newgame+ feature.  Actually you could say you haven't even beaten the game or seen the story unless you have at least played through twice.",One of the best stories you'll ever experience.,1388620800,2,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

There are some aspects of this game that may let you down, but it is still a game I consider worth buying. A lot of people reviewing or commenting on this game are focusing on the bad aspects but there are tons of great things about this game!

- Driving-
By far the most complained about portion of this game. Physics are unreal, and driving is less enjoyable than expected. Nothing like our favorite open world game from Rockstar. There are a lot of cars in this game, (65 they say) but you might not want to be spending a ton of time in them. 7/10

-NPCs-
Great and rather realistic, a new bar has been set for conversations and actions of NPCs.
You can listen in on conversations and arguments that these characters have and it is rather believable. 9.5/10 (some physics make this not perfect)

-Graphics-
Looks very good, when it gets dark the city looks awesome. Walking looks smooth, running is a little weird, but nothing to get worked up over. Animations are fluid and for the most part natural. 8/10

-Overall-
Great game, lots of playability, side missions and extras all over. Graphics are good, but not the best we have seen from the ps4 so far. Biggest issue is driving. 9/10

In the end if you like the idea of playing a game where hacking is a big part of it, along with roaming a large city, and picking up plenty of side tasks get this game. There are a ton of negative reviews, but those will come with any game no matter how good.

3.0,False,"11 6, 2014",A2AWMJMLLPBHDK,B00MU1YEE0,B. Cravens,"About 10 years ago, CoD4 started my affinity for console FPS gaming. It was the reason I bought a 360 and spent countless hours playing with my friends. MW2 then came out and ended up being my series favorite. Its also the game that made me start caring about W/L and K/D stats competitively. I stayed loyal with the series through WaW and Black Ops. I put many hours into Blops, but I did it more as a chore than enjoyment as I felt the series was veering into a same-y direction. I skipped MW3, Blops 2 and Ghosts as they felt unoriginal to me and lacked that special fun feeling present in MW 1 & 2.

After watching many gameplay videos and reading different reviews, I decided to rent Advanced Warfare from Redbox. I played the first few campaign missions and about 6-7 hours worth of multiplayer. I was very impressed and ended up buying it here on Amazon. The campaign seemed interesting enough to get me to complete it soon (which is more than I can say for other CoDs personally), but where I mostly spend my FPS time is in multiplayer like many.

Im very happy with the direction Sledgehammer has taken AW. The Exo Suit adds a lot of combat versatility to the point where 1v1 engagements can have an epic feel with the maneuvering possibilities. Kill streaks don't have the ridiculously discouraging snow ball effect they started having after MW2, and with the Exo Suit verticality, camping seems to be drastically lower in AW. This last one makes me very happy as the increasing camping was a large reason for me leaving CoD originally.

I do have some concerns. Servers can be laggy probably 1 out of every 3 or 4 games on average. However, the game just came out. Remember BF4's launch? I am a major BF fan, and I can tell you AW's launch is smooth as butter compared to BF. There is talk about the lack of dedicated servers being the main issue, but overall the lag was not enough to make me stop playing.

Another concern is how quickly each gun runs out of ammo. It's common for a magazine of 30 to run out in a matter of seconds during full-auto. What this means is that poor aim in an engagement or when an opponent is Exo-maneuvering will likely get you punished hard. Similarly, melee is horrible right now. It only works if you are literally right up on another players face/body. I wouldn't even use melee at all until they patch it. Just stick with hip fire for now.

But my issues are not greater than what I like about AW. The map designs go very well with the Exo Suit and actually remind me of some of MW2's. The game is definitely fast and it is not as easy to score a high K/D consistently, but kills feel very rewarding overall.

Haven't had this much fun with CoD since MW2. Im glad Sledgehammer managed to bring back that arcade fun-ness back with Advanced Warfare. If it's been a few years since you played CoD, I'd recommend giving this a shot or at least renting it from Redbox. If you liked Titanfall, then I would highly encourage you to try out Advanced Warfare.

EDIT:

Advanced Warfare started off great. Once I hit the 15-hour mark, lag & latency issues made themselves present. After hitting 20 hours, I realized they would not be going away. Even after checking in every few weeks, rubber banding, getting killed in one-shot and getting killed after entering corners all were regular occurrences. I docked my review down by 2-stars due to these permanent issues.",Fun for the first 15 hours...,1415232000,,{'Format:': ' CD-ROM'},

JUST CAUSE 2 takes that experience and magnifies it in every way. The world is huge, the visuals are crisp and very beautiful, and the action is as over the top as it can get. I'd be lying if I said the writing and the missions were amazing, but even if you set all of that aside, you'll still have one of the best sandbox games on the market.

Take these comparisons to OBLIVION lightly. JUST CAUSE 2 doesn't even try to have any kind of depth when it comes to the story, the missions, and the sidequests. This is a game for people who like to explore, cause mayhem (chaos), and test boundaries. The people who made it their life's mission to get to the airplane in GTA 3 without unlocking the third island. If you try to dig any deeper than that, you might find yourself disappointed. If you enjoy JC2 for what it is, you'll have yourself a game you can come back to again and again.

Like I said, the story is a flimsy one that would probably be better suited for a '90s Steven Segal flick. You play as Rico Rodriguez, a special agent who's been sent to the (fictional) Southeast Asian island of Panau to track down another agent who has recently gone rogue. To find this rogue agent, you have to gain the trust of the three major gangs on the island. To do this, you have to cause ""chaos"". To cause chaos, you have to, more or less, cause as much damage to the island as you can.

There are several ways to cause ""chaos"". One is to destroy military bases; another is to destroy military-owned structures; another is to blow everything else up: cars, planes, gas stations, broadcast towers, water towers, propaganda trailers, surface-to-air missile sites... the list goes on.

But to get back to the island of Panau - which was the main selling point for me - this place is HUGE, and I do not use the word lightly. To walk from one end to the other will certainly take hours, and even traveling by plane takes at least fifteen minutes. You'll have over 400 square miles to work with, which is 25x larger than OBLIVION, and 5x larger than WORLD OF WARCRAFT, making it one of the largest video game worlds ever created. And it's not just empty space. The developers put a lot of time into making sure that they reward people for exploring every nook and cranny of the game with plenty of easter eggs and vistas that you'll just want to stare at for hours. From lush jungles and beaches to cities and mountaintop villages, there are plenty of unique places to discover on the island.

And just to drive home the ""over-the-topness"" this game allows, you're equipped with a personal grappling hook, and you can do almost anything you can imagine with it. Hook an enemy to the back of your car, tether to an enemy chopper and hijack it in the air, use it to scale mountains or buildings. You're also given a parachute that you can deploy at any time, so if you want to fly as high as you can go, jump out, and land harmlessly: go for it. The game really goes out of its way to make sure that you have a fun time messing around in Panau.

If none of that sounds appealing enough to warrant a purchase, then look elsewhere. Outside the massive world, the dozens of unique vehicles, the spectacular graphics, and the ability to go anywhere and do whatever you want, there's not much else. There's the story, achievements, and a lot of collecting to do, but I definitely wouldn't say they're the game's redeeming features. It's everything else, and there's a lot of it.",Here comes freedom!,1303776000,3,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},
5.0,False,"11 18, 2006",A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B000FW8FK0,Movie Nerd,"This is a really fun wrestling game even if the X-Box 360 controlling takes awhile to get used to. I'm used to the Playstation 2 controlling. Plus I still find Here Comes the Pain the one that's easy to want to go back and play again and again. I mean the season mode is the funnest since you can add legends or created wrestlers to the season mode roster. Then you can play any other match on a card besides the matches for the wrestler you chose.

  I don't think season mode is that fun without that feature. I mean otherwise you just play season mode to unlock the legends and never go back once you got them. While in Here Comes the Pain I kept going back to play season mode even if I did unlock every legend. This game is fun enough to make you go back for more and more even if it's not for season mode. The GM mode is cool where now you can hire writers and pick the one who's best at writing things like David vs Goliath stories and much more. You then pick the two wrestlers that a best to fit in that feud. I also like seeing Title Mode back. Where you can defend or win a title any time you want.

  Plus I love that you can rip-up signs from the audience ""though I haven't learned how to do that yet. You can also fight in the audience this time around which especially adds more to hardcore matches or Last Man Standing matches. The game also has a good roster even if some are pretty bad choices to have in the game. I mean I always forget guys like Vito, Viscera, Snitsky and Paul Burcham are even in the game. Plus do we really need 4 different Mick Foley's ? I mean you'd think they would've learned by now. All they had to do was have one Mick Foley and just give you the option to change his costume before a match to either Cactus Jack, Dude Love or Mankind. It wastes 3 spaces when they could've added other Legends instead.

  Instead of Viscera you could've had someone like Sabu instead, instead of Snitsky how about the Sandman, instead of Paul Burcham ""how ever you spell it"" how about Paul London, Brian Kendrick should've been on it as well. It also feels weird not seeing the Spirit Squard after they've been thrown in our faces constantly on Raw. I also wish Jeff Hardy was on this game. Plus instead of 3 Mick Foley's we could've had Rick Rude, Randy Savage and Owen Hart.

  Some fans complain about Bam Bam Bigelow and Taz being Legends but I like that. I was a fan of Bigelow in his ECW days. All the WWE did with him was have him lose to a football player at a WrestleMania. While in ECW the guy was almost as unstoppable as Taz. The WWE wasted Taz and of course you wouldn't think of him as a Legend  after seeing his WWE Jobber years. However in ECW the guy was an unstoppable animal that is truly worthy of being called a Legend. He was the Stone Cold Steve Austin of ECW. I also like seeing Shane a Legend but if he's one on the game then why isn't Vince ? It feels weird being able to play as Shane but not Vince. Despite minor complaints this is still a really good wrestling game. It is of course still light years better than the first Smackdown vs Raw which I never played as much as Here Comes the Pain.

  Complete list of Legends I'd like to see in the next game: Hogan, Bret Hart, Eddie Guerrero,Owen Hart, Anvil, King Kong Bundy, Earthquake, The Big Bossman, Brian Pillman, The Demolition Axe and Smash, L.O.D Hawk and Animal, Vince, Shane, Razor Ramon, Diesel, Arn Anderson, The Rock, Steve Austin, Mr. Perfect, Vader, if you unlock Mick Foley you get all his personalities in one without him taking up 4 spaces, Chris Jericho, Yokozuna, Rick Rude, Randy Savage, JBL, Jerry Lawyler,Trish Stratus, Lita and the Ultimate Warrior.

  The next game should also have a complete list of ECW wrestlers such as RVD, Sabu, The Big Show, Tommy Dreamer, Kevin Thorn, Test, C.M Punk ""who I wish was in this one!"", Mike Knox and Hardcore Holly.

  I also wouldn't mind that if you play as a certain popular wrestler in season mode that you can unlock legend type matches as well. Like if you play as the Undertaker you unlock a body bag match that he used to have back in the early 90's. Or that when you unlock Stone Cold you unlock 3 Stages of Hell. Plus would be cool if Psycho Sid was on it and if you unlock him you also unlock the Lumberjack match since he had one with HBK once.

- The game is on rails. There are very few if any choices of any kind. You can always tell where you need to go because there are obvious handholds. There is no alternate path, the treasures buy you nothing. You never talk to anyone to obtain clues, etc.

- The reliance on shootouts is too much. The guns are amazing and the shooting mechanics are great. Even the enemy AI is extremely well done. But the antagonist being guns and fighting too much, and puzzles too little, makes it less fun than it should have been.

- The movement mechanics are good at best. Some parts are great such as the climbing and grappling hook. But the jumping, evading enemies, the circle button that means evade, fall, and hide all at the same time depending on where you happen to be standing...makes the already lame shootouts much worse.

I have been flying PC-based flight sims ever since 1983, when I installed the original ""Microsoft Flight Simulator"" on an Apple IIe with a monochromatic-green monitor.  Since then, I've put in roughly 10,000 hours of ""flying"" on essentially every PC-based flight sim ever made, from Microprose F-19 Stealth fighter all the way up to Falcon 4.0.  For whatever it's worth, folks, I'm an expert on this particular subject.

A few years ago, Shockwave Tri-Synergy came out with the equally magnificent ""Wings of Power,"" that included the coolest airplane ever designed for MSFS 2004, the B-29 Superfortress ""Doc's Deadly Dose.""  I said then that ""Wings of Power"" was worth the $30.00 for that airplane alone.

I am please beyond words to report that, in ""Aircraft Powerpack 2,"" the geniuses at Shockwave Tri-Synergy have utterly outdone themselves yet again.  This time, the star of the show is the absolutely magnificent and totally addictive P-51D Mustang, ""The Flying Undertaker.""  Ladies and Gentlemen, there has simply never been a finer airplane designed for Microsoft FS than this utterly FANTASTIC P-51D.

The other airplanes are all great too.  In fact, they are so good that I feel bad giving so much of the spotlight to the Mustang.  But anyone who is a part of the aviation community will understand.  If there is one airplane in the history of all aircraft that has the biggest aura of ""The Right Stuff"" hanging around it, it is the P-51.  Quite simply, if you were to survey all the serious pilots on earth and ask them what their all-time dream airplane is, I'm guessing that the Mustang would beat out the next closest answer by a huge percentage.

In this nearly perfect simulation software, Shockwave Tri-Synergy has given this legendary airplane all the attention it deserves.  Quite simply, this Mustang and all the other fighters included in this package are so good that they will give you a reason to go out and drop $5000 on the hottest gaming platform made, simply so that you can crank up all the scenery and frame rates to their max and immerse yourself in the ultimate adrenaline-pumping flight sim experience.

Very few of us will ever fly, much less own, a real P-51 Mustang.  For several thousand dollars, you can get an hour in ""Crazy Horse"" down in Sanford, Florida.  For several million dollars plus maintenance and operating costs, you can own your own irreplaceable piece of history and spend your nights awake worrying about some line guy backing his tug tractor into a propeller that would cost over $50,000 to replace.

Most of us pilots have had to content ourselves with watching Jeff Ethell's ""Roaring Glory"" DVD series and flying these airplanes in our dreams.  Now, thanks to Shockwave Tri-Synergy, we get to take our dreams to the next level.

Let's put it this way - nearly everything in the cockpit works.  And I mean nearly EVERYTHING.  Right after you install this and start flying the P-51D, you are going to wind up going online, looking for a copy of the real Mustang Pilot's Operating Handbook.  Plus, this cockpit isn't the battered, half-complete, half-modernized amalgamation that most half-restored P-51s have today.  This is a cockpit that you would find in a brand-new P-51 in 1945, with everything shiny new and all the switches, levers and buttons right where they should be.

No matter how experienced a pilot you are (either real or virtual) you will want to get to know this airplane cautiously.  Give yourself plenty of room - use the big runway at Edwards, or the one at Salina, Kansas.  Spend some time doing traffic patterns, and discover the big pitch change that comes with landing gear operation.  Discover the fact that you can't just pull the power back to idle on the downwind leg abeam the touchdown zone, like you would in a Cessna 172, unless you want to come down like a stone.  Discover the fact that full flaps need to be saved until you are crossing the fence at about 100 - 110 mph.  Discover that the tailwheel is free castoring, and that with the throttle all the way back at idle, you have no rudder effectiveness and have to use differential brakes.  Discover that when you put the nose down at 25,000 feet with the power at 50 inches, you will learn about transsonic control difficulties very quickly.  Discover that, without proper mixture control, you won't be able to climb past about 15,000 feet, and that with it, you can scratch for 40,000 feet if you are determined enough.  Discover that you can blast along a shoreline at over 350 mph at 100 feet, and then pull the nose up, up, up and zoom climb over a mountain, roll inverted and plunge back down to the ocean again.  Discover the ultimate piston-driven adrenaline rush.

And that's just in the P-51.  The Thunderbolt, Spitfire, Zero, Me-109 and Warhawk are all modeled with equal love and care, and I only have a few nits to pick.  For one, why do we get three almost identical Messerschmitts?  The Trop would be enough, couldn't we have had a Corsair, a FW-190 or a P-38 Lightning?  Why do we get the almost pre-historic looking P-47C, with its cage cockpit, when we could have had the far more beautiful bubble-canopy P-47D?  Why do the landing gear sound like little civilian electric motors, instead of like the real systems in the real fighters?

And that's my list of nits - there really isn't anything else to complain about, and there is SO much here to love!

I said this once about ""Doc's Deadly Dose,"" and I'll say it here again about ""The Flying Undertaker.""  To any serious pilot or aviation buff, this software would be worth more than $30.00 for the P-51D alone.  The other airplanes are just a fantastic bonus.

The action is also great, and the special weapons (like the 'land shark' or the 'pocket black-hole') are superb. I enjoyed most of the experience.

Why only 4 stars? Because of the idiotic save-game system! The way you save in this game is by visiting pubs that can be found in the levels (usually one per level). While visiting these pubs is great fun (take the time to listen to the dialog!), they do not work well for their intended purpose. For one, they are to inconsistently positioned. Sometimes, you may play for half an hour, just to find a pub 2 minutes before the end of the level. This causes you to replay very large portions of the game, some of which you literally have to learn by heart and play absolutely perfect (count your bullets!) to make it through.

The other problem with the pub-save-system is that the levels are way too big for a single save point (and the levels with more than one pub are generally the shorter ones for some odd reason). It's just not cool to play for 30 minutes or more without an oportunity to save. You often achieve major objectives with no save point anywhere to be seen.

Also, you will find yourself going back to the pubs just to save the game again. This means that you end up running through previously cleared parts of a level with nothing to do. For minutes at a time! Can you say 'boring'?

If this game had a better save-game system, it would be pure fun and an instant classic. The developers cheat themselves out of a great title with this sort of nonsense.

Pros
Sound: Really solid sound output.  The bass really hits and you can almost feel the headphones vibrating every time you squeeze the trigger in a shooter.  In-game dialouge comes through nice and clear as well.
Compatiability: If you're a multi console owner you can't do much better than these. PS3, 360, PS4, PC, iphone etc etc.
Length of cord: Again, wired was important to me because the last pair of wireless headphones I had suffered from the sound cutting in and out, probably because of all the wifi routers in my building.  This cord gives me the consistent and clear sound that I desired, yet I don't have to sit right in front of my tv to enjoy it.
Mic: No need to yell to be heard. I come through crystal clear on these and even when I don't necessarily speak with the intention of being heard by others, the mic still picks me up.
Options: You can simply slide a knob to set the microphone on or off.
Chat control: I love being able to set my mic in headphone volumes (meaning whether I hear myself talkinging in the headphones and the ability to adjust the volume of other players talking.
Build quality: These don't feel filmsy or cheap.  I stepped on them once and they're fine.

Cons
No optical support without using some sort of RCA cable adapter. I currently have the headphones hooked up to my TV as the PS4 is not compatiable with composite or RCA cables.

No way to really lock your sound settings in place.  There is a rectangular device on the wire running from the headphones that allows you to adjust the bass, treble, mic volumes, chat volumes etc but it does so via a sliding nub. This would probably skyrocket the cost of the headphones, but I would really love being able to set my preferred settings and not lose them because the nub is moved by accident.

Other than that, I can't complain.  If you have the means you can probably do better in terms of features and sound quality, but for this price and the amount of systems you can use this with, you're definetely getting a whole lot of bang for your buck.

I was warned that the Ninja Gaiden series was more than a challenge and the first of its kind was no exception  I had to endure the annoying back hit so many times (the player jumps back at a great distance when hit by responding enemies, often causing him to fall into a pit) and get use to the wall jumps because the player doesn't always attach on the walls that smoothly.  The obsticles of the levels and the swifter than lightning enemies may be a challenge, but fighting many of the bosses are kind of easy (or at least up until level 4 because I never made it past 5 yet).  I love a challenge as long as its fun and fair (horray for unlimited continues), and Ninja Gaiden is one of them.  I also heard that the second game is a bit more challenging, but the third game shows zero mercy (only for ""skilled ninjas"" for that one).  For now, I need to finish the first one before I challenge my limited skills on the harder sequels.",Fun Ninja Adventure,1353888000,,,

The plots were complete nonsense and I often wondered if the localization team for SNK ever took an engrish class at the highschool level. Luckily, you never pull at threads when you was schooling suckers at the arcade on these games. No one was more excited about this series than I was but what went wrong?

The Controls! This games controls plays like you fell asleep on your hand and then tried to control your PS2 with a Kinect flailing your numb arms around. Or maybe like somebody inverted your controller and then cut half way through your controller cord with a scissors before you got started. Good luck keeping your nostalgia glasses on while trying to relive your arcade days with these horrific controls.

Additional Warnings- This was not done in HD so anyone with a respectable tv will suffer the consequences. The load screens make you think of starting a side game of Skyrim for something to do while you wait for your retro fighting game to load. This was only marginally faster to load than the Neo Geo CD and that is not a good thing.

The King of Fighters deserved better treatment than this. Hell, SNK deserved better than this but that is a history lesson for another day. Seeing one of my favorite franchises being turned into shovelware brings a tear to my eye.

While MMXCM is a bit basic as far as exploration and storyline goes, it really shines in the fun department.  The graphics fit the game perfectly and the voice acting, while not the greatest, is adequate.  (Mega Man fans, this time our blue bomber doesn't sound like a little girl!)  Most of the MMX games are hurt by less than stellar voice acting :).

Combat is fun, in that you get weapon energy before each battle.  You can choose to use it, or let it build up for stronger attacks.  Then, you can even use Final Strikes, which means all 3 of your fighting characters jump in at once to deal out major damage.  And each character has a special transform move that makes them twice as tough.  Lots of strategy falls into the battles on this game, especially the boss battles.

There is a sort of mini game that really gets you hooked once you pick up the basics.  During the game, you find Deployment Robots.  You can send these out to stages you have already visited to pick up secret treasures.  They go up levels depending on if you placed them properly and used good strategies.  Very fun.

Speaking of Final Fantasy, I think this game easily blows away FF8, FFX, and FFX-2.

The combat system is fun and doesn't really get old, especially when you get all the characters and are able to switch them in and out of battle at will.  And unlike every other RPG I have ever played, every character is fun and useful to use.  In all the Final Fantasy games, there have been a few characters who I tried to keep swept under the rug at all costs.  Not so in this game.

I would have given the game an overall score of 5 if exploration had been a little better.  Other than that, this is a great game, ESPECIALLY for Mega Man fans.",Awesome game for RPG fans,1096588800,9,,

The first game came out in 1998 I believe and it is an iconic game in the industry and inspired many other stealth games. Each new game in the franchise has had heavy expectations placed on it. The new Thief, like Thief Deadly Shadows before it, has had a  mixed reception. There are those who expect each new game to be exactly like the original. And there are others who want Thief to be more of an action game. Then there are those that have always understood what Thief is about at its core and enjoy it for what it is: a damn good pure stealth series.

The new Thief is no exception. Nothing has given me the sense of skulking about in the shadows and having to use stealth in order to survive better than Thief has. This isn't an action/stealth hybrid like Dishonored or Splinter Cell that you can go in guns blazing and cut down half a dozen guards in a short amount of time. In Thief you have to remain undetected or face the consequences.

At first I was disappointed by the fact you can't use the rope arrow on any wood surface as before and can only attach to specially highlighted beams. But the game makes up for it in other ways. The new swoop ability is pure awesomeness. It gives a fluidity and speed to the game while still feeling stealthy and appropriate.

The graphics are quite good, with some of the best lighting and shadows I have ever seen in a game. The world itself is quite dreary and that may turn off some people, but it has character and a strange dark charm of its own.

The music could be a little more fitting for the setting, in my opinion, but the overall sound design is quite atmospheric. The voice acting is very good in the case of Garrett and fairly good in the case of most of the other characters. Garrett is such an intriguing character.

All in all I think Thief carries the stealth torch admirably, and probably better than any other modern ""stealth"" game. I've enjoyed it a lot and if you like stealth I am sure you will enjoy it too.",This is the best stealth game in years.,1393545600,7,{'Platform:': ' PC Online Game Code'},

Sure, the commercials for GOW 3 looked pretty epic, but could it really live up to all the accolades being thrown its way? Well, I figured I would give it a chance so I lined up at the local game shop at midnight to pick up a copy so I could play it for an hour or two before getting some pre-work sleep. One or two hours soon turned into four and then five hours. I was having a very hard time making myself turn the game off as I was getting deeper and deeper into the story. I kept promising myself that I would stop at the next save point, but then I would think, okay I will just go a bit farther and then turn it off.

Let's start off with the obvious, how does this game look? GOW 3 may possibly be the single greatest looking game ever made! No effort was sparred in bringing the graphics to life. Even the smallest and most distant background items are very detailed. Everything Kratos smashes with his fist or arsenal of weaponry gets covered with blood and gore. I'm not just talking about Mortal Kombat blood for the sake of blood that disappears within a second or two of being splashed into the air. I'm talking about blood patterns that alter the way the baddies and Kratos look as you continue your mission of blood lust. Even the water that Kratos occasionally has to swim and trudge through looks insanely real as it ripples away from his movements. The lighting and shadow effects are as good or better than I've ever seen. For an example of this just check out the Helios boss battle and the cave level that follows.

Next let's look at game play. GOW 3 plays like a dream. The controls are fairly simple making switching to the right weapon for the job and being able to double jump from platform to platform completely up to the skill of the player. I will admit that this game is what a lot of people describe as a ""button masher"". You mash buttons to perform combos, complete sequences, and have an extremely intimate exchange with a goddess...yep that last one really happens. The thing about GOW 3 is that button mashing, while it only gets you so far even on the normal difficulty setting, has never been so enjoyable. The melee combat system alone gives you approximately a dozen different ways to decapitate, disembowel, stomp, or throw your enemies. If that doesn't do it for you, simply grab one of the baddies and run around using them as a battering ram to destroy other baddies. Kratos gets a handful of other weapons and items with most of them having some unique use in different situations. My weapon of choice is the Cestus which brings new meaning to the phrase ""open up a can of whoop @$s"". For an example of just how devastating the Cestus can be check out the Hercules boss battle...I mean WOW, this is some brutally epic stuff!

Finally there's the story...because if this is just random violence wrapped up in a gorgeous package would it still be fun? In this case I think so, but luckily GOW 3 has a completely enthralling story line. Even if you're like me and didn't have the experience of GOW 1 and 2 you can easily jump into this game. You're given a nearly 20 minute history lesson when you first start the game. You will be up to speed and obliterating a multitude of enemies in no time. Kratos himself is an undeniably interesting character. He is completely brash and uncaring about all the death and destruction unfolding around him due to his own actions. He is blindly driven by his rage and need for revenge which leads to intense and at moments humorous dialogue. The voice acting and mannerisms displayed by all characters could not be more spot on! I can't stress enough how epic the sheer scale and weight of this story is. Smashing your way through waves of baddies and completing puzzles to face off against one of the many truly impressive bosses hasn't been this satisfying since the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System! With GOW 3 clocking in at slightly over 10 hours it's a very satisfying experience whether it's your first or even fifth time playing through. And yes, this game is that deep and visually stunning that 3-5 play-throughs will feel like a breeze.

It's time to wrap this thing up! I realize I'm way late to the party when it comes to putting out my thoughts on GOW 3, but it's something I've been meaning to do for quite a long time now. If you have not picked up this game by now then you're looking at some really good timing because you can get it from around $15 used to $25 new. GOW 3 has earned its place among a very select few games ever released that can legitimately be regarded as ""best ever"".

Dead Space 2 is great at certain points, and it's fascinating to learn more about Unitology, but the ""More, more more"" philosophy eventually makes the player numb to the horror elements, and the rest of the game doesn't do much to stand out.

Long Review:

As a rule, I always rent games before buying them, as I prefer to spend only a few bucks on a video game, rather then pay full price and find out I don't like it.  However, being a huge fan of the first Dead Space game, I made an exception and purchased Dead Space 2 on it's first day of release, looking forward to another trip into the world of Unitology, necromorphs, and outright insanity.  Sadly, it was a purchase I really regret.

Dead Space 2 follows Isaac Clarke, the unluckiest engineer in the Milky Way Galaxy, as he wakes up on a space station a few years after the events of Dead Space 1.  Not knowing how he got there, he quickly finds himself thrust into yet another necromorph outbreak, and a desperate race for survival, while having to battle a far more personal foe that may threaten his very sanity.

The first Dead Space was an outstanding experience in sci-fi horror.  You were trapped aboard an empty space ship millions of miles from rescue; ammo was scarce, and you had to use everything in your disposal to survive.  Naturally, the sequel would want to further build upon that foundation by giving the player more of what they wanted...more monsters, more guns, bigger environments, and more action.  However, the, ""More, more, more"" attitude completely backfired in almost every aspect, giving us a very disappointing shooter that somehow manages to make a misstep on almost everything that made the first game a masterpiece.

To begin with, the story of Dead Space 2 doesn't really feel important...there's a necromorph outbreak, and you have to stop it, so off you go on another quest to destroy another marker.  By the end, it doesn't feel like you've accomplished much, and it all feels somewhat weightless, with little dramatic weight.  Isaac's dementia, a huge selling point in advertisements and on the back of the game box itself, is not used to it's full potential, instead being used for a few hallucinations and seeing his dead girlfriend.  Isaac never seems crazy or suffering from his dementia, and it's a sadly underused idea that I would have liked to see expanded.

The characters don't fare well either:  Isaac now talks, and aside from sounding much younger then he really is (he's 43, but sounds like he's in his late 20's), he's still an errand boy, only now more people tell him to do things instead of just one or two.  Romantic lead Ellie comes across as a generic action girl, and doesn't leave an impression.  The main bad guy, Tideman, is so non-threatening that I wanted to give him a lollipop, pat him on the head, and assure him that he was a very good sport for at least trying (and it gets downright amusing how often he says something along the lines of, ""It all ends here Clarke!"").  The character with the most depth, ironically, is fellow mental patient Stross: he has the most fascinating story of any Dead Space character to date, and it was a delight to see what he would do next as the game went along.

To it's credit, I do like how Dead Space 2 delves deeper into Unitology, the not-Scientology-religion that's taken over earth in the Dead Space universe.  It's fascinating to learn about their beliefs and how they operate (""Give unto the church and the church will give unto you""), especially considering how most of the unfortunate residents of Titan station have miniature markers and shrines in their possession, along with taking up mass ritual suicide.

But while the Unitology element of the game is impressive, the story and characters are still weak; that alone won't break a game, but perhaps the biggest flaw of Dead Space 2 is it's policy of, ""More, more, more.""  So many horror elements are thrown at you throughout the game that you quickly become desensitized to it, and as a result, I found that the game just wasn't scary.  It's the type of horror where you're walking down an empty corridor only for a monster to suddenly leap out a vent and practically scream, ""LOOKATMEIMAMONSTAHRAHRAHRAHBOOGABOOGABOOGA!""  It's startling the first time, but quickly becomes VERY predictable.  In fact, there's only one area in the entire game where you walk around for an extended period of time without being attacked, but it doesn't last long before the monsters are leaping at you again and screaming at the top of their lungs.

Speaking of monsters, there are several new foes you have to face, along with almost all the baddies from the first game; the problem is that all of them are excruciatingly annoying, such as the puker, who's lovely vomit attack is annoyingly accurate; the leapers, ware are even faster and stronger then before; the damn stalkers, who will make you want to take a ripper blade to whoever designed them, and the pack, which consists of zombified children, who are fast, annoying, and DO NOT STOP SHRIEKING.  You're constantly swarmed by multiple types of necromorphs all at once, and they only get stronger as the game goes on, increasing the frustration level triplefold.  There's a multi-level battle in a red room, for example, that made me want to quit the game, simply on how many enemies I faced, and how many times I kept dying.

But what's most disappointing about Dead Space 2 is the lack of ""Wow!"" moments.  The first game had incredible boss battles, but shockingly, there's only one boss fight at the very end of the game.  You do fight a few mini-boss necromorphs throughout the game, but they are, frankly, forgettable.  There's also a crushing lack of amazing moments that stick with you once the game ends; the first game had several, from a trench run in the void of space to the final, titanic boss battle.  There are only a few such moments here:  A train ride, an astonishingly awesome free flight through space (the zero gravity segments, by the way, are MUCH improved, and a sheer joy to play), and a moment involving a rather large needle(which is the most terrifying moment in the series to date).  While these are the moments where Dead Space 2 is at it's best, it's so frustrating because once they're over, you won't see anything that comes even close to being as cool.

In keeping with not really standing out, the levels of Dead Space 2 don't leave much of an impression.  To their credit, the developers do try to have variety:  Instead of going through numerous industrial environments like last time, you go through apartments, malls, schools, military bases, etc.  The problem is that most of these areas are bright, clean, shiny, and well lit, which isn't scary at all.  A mine stage, for example, instead of being dark and creepy, is filled with brightly colored lights, to the point where it started to feel like the inside of a christmas tree; there's even a stage where everything is brightly lit with blue light, and it honestly wouldn't be too much of a stretch to see neon signs and disco balls hanging about.  You'll also notice that a lot of these environments start repeating themselves, as you'll go through the same hallways, plazas, and walkways again and again, and it reaches ludicrous levels about halfway through the game, where the amount of copying and pasting becomes absurd, and it feels like the developers were trying to pad the game out to make it longer.  However, to be fair, the entire last stage of the game does manage to become visually amazing, and stands out as the most exciting stage of the series so far, and is easily the most pulse-pounding and dramatic part of the entire game.

One final nitpick:  Isaac's dead girlfriend, rather then being a terrifying specter of horror and loss, instead spends so much time yapping away and shrieking about how guilty Isaac supposedly feels, that I wanted to slap duct tape across her mouth to make her shut up.

Overall, Dead Space 2, is, in my opinion, an example of how too much can really be too much.  Take the classic film, ""Aliens"" for example; it had a bigger location then the first film, more aliens, marines, guns, and explosions.  But the high paced action moments were spread out throughout the film, and didn't come nonstop, one after another.  If Dead Space 2 cut out about half the combat sequences and just slowed down, I would give it a much higher score.  But as it is, I feel it's a noble attempt to be a great sequel, but it stumbles badly.  There's a great game here; it's just too fast paced, too full of monsters, and tries to pack in too much for it's own good.","A shuffling, shrieking mess",1313107200,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

That is, until I saw pictures of Ecco the Dolphin.  This game simply had what I loved at the time- an underwater dolphin adventure.  I loved thinking about floating around underwater and loved dolphins since hey, they're beautiful fish right?  The game surely doesn't disappoint in terms of speed.  This game is REALLY fast!  Unfortunately the game seems to focus on speed above all else.  It's not as charming as it once was.  The concept was innovative at the time, but nowadays some of us chuckle at the idea of controlling a dolphin going on an adventure.  The game seems to have an element of history to it, meaning you get to hear stories of the Atlantis and even swim to those particular areas.  The problem venturing into new areas is that the game takes place underwater the entire time and your surroundings are never much different from the other places, so everything tends to blend together.

Ecco the Dolphin is one rock hard game too.  It's hard in that it's almost impossible to know where you're going without some online help, and as some of you may remember, back in the day we didn't have the assistance of online help so most of us just put the game away and saved it for a rainy day whenever the frustration level kicked up too high.  There's some carefully hidden places where you have to swim through rocks just to find new important locations, and it's really aggravating and time-consuming to place those particular areas in such a place most of us would NEVER think about looking.  Perhaps a guide detailing each area would help tremendously, but as far as I know no such map exists.

Another problem is that there's only a few varieties of enemies.  You will see the same jellyfish, sharks, crabs and squids over and over.  Ecco can take them out using a sonar move, or a charge move which is neat.  You'll also see several diamonds and rings that Ecco can push to open up new areas which is a pretty cool original feature.  I honestly think the game was designed all wrong however.  Instead of making it open world (or rather open waters) the game makers should have ditched that concept entirely and just focused on shorter straight forward levels where the object is to avoid and survive sea creatures until you arrive to the boss fight (and this game has a SEVERE shortage of boss fights).  I say this because the exploration can get monotonous after a while due to the game lacking entertainment and replay value.  Ditch the exploring aspect, and especially ditch the history lessons and storytelling since we're playing a game here.

But the good news is that the music is really tremendous.  An experimental rock band like Tangerine Dream would be proud to hear all these moody, ambient and very detailed and original songs (original by Genesis standards I mean).  Really incredible job overall on the music which does provide a feeling of underwater loneliness and desperation.  Usually I have negative things to say about the cold metallic music normally found on the Genesis, but not this time.

Overall well the high speed of our little Ecco friend is quite immaculate, the graphics are downright fantastic, Ecco's animations are really smooth and for some people the exploration may feel satisfying enough for some but to me the game's a little disappointing in that regard.  If we consider the lack of genres that focused on underwater exploring back in the early 90's however and recognize Ecco for being one of the first to have such a quest, well, that's pretty cool then.  But the game feels like it needs more to truly win me over.",ecco or echo?,1408579200,,,

I had very high hopes for this game.  I gave it 4 stars but really I should have given it 2.  The rating shouldn't suffer because I did though so I went ahead with the 4.
The people who loved this game I apologize to you right now.  I'm not a gaming genius.  I love games don't get me wrong and the look and sound of this one had me hooked.  It was a great idea.
Now for those who want to know what I didn't like there is a list and it's got several items on it.
I played the Gamecube version of this game and maybe that's why I had so much trouble out of it I don't know.
1st my guy was way too easy to kill.  I couldn't get used to the game because before I knew it I was dead.  I know big time gamers are blaming me and part of it is me.
However, this game didn't have a mode that I could find that once I saved at a certain place I could ever end up where I was when I saved.  If you die you start the level over from the beginning.  If you are a great gamer with lots of patience that's fine.
If you are like me and want to throw the Gamecube through the TV it's a different story(And don't do that I am not responsible I didn't make the game).
I really liked the game itself it had good ideas to it and I wanted to see the storyline carried out.
However when you are sitting on pins and needles because you might get killed and have to start over is a pain.
It would take me forever to get past a level and I only got to the place where you are out in the snow.
I'm sure it's because I'm not a good first person shooter player, but part of it is the game.  There is absolutely no room for error with this game.  Your checkpoints as they call them are your only real save point that you have so you don't have to start from the very beginning of the game.
I don't want to have to stealth around though and kill guys only to have one jump out and kill me right off.  The controls move smoothly but I didn't like the fact that if I am lucky enough to shoot one guy my gun perspective changes and next thing I know someone could be in front of me before I can get focused again.
I found this game frustrating at best.  When I did get the hang of it somewhat I got stalled in the woods in the snow and by the time I got the power turned on the guards would sneak out and kill me.
They could have made this game so much better by adding a dummy feature for people like me.  And when you hit save you were actually accomplishing something by using the save feature. The game usually saves your checkpoint so that's not a problem but into the level if you get any distance you better hold on because if you mess up your back to the beginning of that level.  That's  alot of protection to look for when you have guys coming from all angles.
The auto aim feature was awkward at best.
This game is well intentioned, but I only wish the creators of these game would also remember some of us enjoy games, but aren't excellent players. I understand programming these things isn't simple, so throw in a cheat code or something so I can enjoy the gaming experience without thinking badly about what would otherwise be a fun game if I didn't die every 5 seconds.",This game????,1071705600,4,,

Firstly, make sure you realize that while this is labeled for the DSi, it fits the DS Lite perfectly. My son was easily able to fit his DS Lite into the pouch and was also able to put six games in the pouch as well. There's also an extra pocket where you could potentially put more games as well, but he opted not to. He did, however, absolutely love the little spot for the stylus, allowing him to keep the stylus in the pouch or to have a second stylus ready to go - ya know, in case he accidentally drops the other one in the car and we can't find it...because of course that would never happen. Ahem, anyway, while he loved the design, I absolutely loved the hardness of the case. The back and the front have an extra amount of protection to them, so that if he just happens to drop the case - because of COURSE that will never happen (read the sarcasm there), it will have a bit of protection. He has a larger case, but this is the perfect size to travel in the car or on a field trip, and the fact that it has all the Mario characters on it (although my son pointed out that poor Donkey Kong never gets any respect and is not on the case) is just an added bonus!",Perfect Small Carrying Case for DS Lite,1307577600,2,,

First things first:  the sound quality is great.

My wife is a bit of an audiophile (and a Ratchet & Clank fan) - and the first time she put these on her exact response was, ""Holy @#!^, this sounds fantastic!"".

The first night I got it, I used it for the first three guided meditations, customized my happy colorful mandala, and used the play option some.  Then about an hour or two later, I felt a wonderful sense of what I would call positively energized peace and well-being.  I had been feeling kind of run down, anxious and somewhat depressed because of school, work, a stressful work environment, and of course holiday stress.  I have had virtually no energy, but at the same time felt sort of overly anxious so that I couldn't sleep well and my mind was laden with worries, worries, worries.  I knew beforehand that meditation had worked very well for me in these kinds of situations.  However, I had gotten off track because of a momentarily overly busy lifestyle and then this led to just getting totally derailed.  I heard about Leela from the tiny buddha website and picked up a copy at Gamestop.  I LOVE IT!!!

One thing I really like about it is that you have so many options of HOW to meditate.  You can choose to do guided meditation with the silky voice of Deepak Chopra guiding you or you can do silent meditation.  And within each of these categories you have various meditations to choose from or you can do them all as many times as you want.  If you want to focus on a particular meditation or a particular chakra, you have that option.

And what I really really like is that even if you are too tired or worn out to do these kinds of meditation, you can always do the play version which is absolutely wonderful!  In the past, the number one reason I have stopped meditating is because I've been too physically and/or mentally exhausted to even sit and meditate. Soon thereafter, I end up getting off track with my meditation practice and then it's simply not a part of my routine at all.  Inevitably, I end up getting so run down that I have to bring everything to a screeching halt and re-vamp my schedule/routine/etc. in order to fit meditation back into my schedule somehow because it works so much better than anything else I've tried (and I've tried all kinds of stuff!)  I have a very emotionally taxing job so it is critical that I regularly practice self-care; otherwise, I will not be able to give the quality of service my clients need and deserve.  This is but one important reason why this program is so great.  You have so many levels of meditation and choices at each level.

In addition, all the meditations have a beautifully colorful and abstractly organic scene to watch if you'd like.  There are also soothing sounds so if the visual focus doesn't work for you, just listen to the music.

I have read some good books on meditation such as ""8 Minute Meditation"" as well as many others.  I also have many DVD's of Qi Gong, Tai Chi, Yoga, etc., etc., and they are all wonderful.  I've also had personal training in many of these areas as well as martial arts and several forms of dance.  However, for someone who is serious about meditation and who has experienced the truly deep and expansive rewards of a good meditation practice, this is a very nice resource to have on hand.  Variety is the spice of life, they say, and it is this variety that will help keep you on track.  This has helped me keep on track, even though we all fall short of our own expectations sometimes.  After all, we are perfectly imperfect and that's just perfect, right?  ;-)  Leela is a great resource for beginners as well because it is just flat out the sweetest eye and ear candy I've seen and heard for meditation.  In actuality, it is the composite of all the features of Leela that make it so awesome.  The price is no more expensive than other Wii games so if want this kind of program for a game system, be ready to pay game system prices.  Plus, you have more flexibility on a game system than you would have on a DVD.  To me personally, it's well worth the regular game system price that it retails for.  I'd rather pay $40 for Leela that will benefit me physically, mentally and spiritually on a more steady basis than pay $10 on DVD's that I'll get tired of in no time, OR $40 or more a week for personal training.  I'd go with Leela any day.  :-)

I'm so glad that Deepak Chopra has created such a fun and user friendly meditation program.  This program fills a very needed void and I really hope that it will be the spark that turns more people on to the mental, physical and spiritual health benefits of meditation which have been substantiated by peer-reviewed research by very reliable sources.  I encourage you to investigate this for yourself.  You don't have to take my word for it.  The proof is waiting to be found.

What I'm now looking forward to is seeing this program/app/game on the iPhone and the Nintendo DS/3DS.  ;-)

- It has a really long connection cable that allows more room to move around.
- It has a very nice design with the buttons and all.

- It works with PC as long as you download all of the drivers.
- Plug and play for the Playstation 3

- It's wired. This one isn't really a con, it's more of a matter of preference for me. Some people like wired over wireless, but other (such as myself) prefer the wireless controllers.
- It feels cheap. This controller has a sort of cheap vibe to it, almost like it's going to break at any given moment.
- No Six Axis technology. This is unfortunate as some of the games I really like to play require this feature.

UPDATE - Ok, so I'm the type of reviewer that will definitely admit to making a bad call on any review I publish.  My initial review of this game was a bad call.  Yes, initially I did continuously turn it off in frustration.  However, I kept hearing about how good the game was, so I decided to sit down and work through my frustrations and really try to get into the game.  Well, that was a great idea.  It took some patience, that's for sure.  But once I got over a few initial frustrating points and actually got into the game, I couldn't put it down.  It really ended up being a great game.  I played through it all the way to the end (which took quite a while) and I must say, it is now one of my favorite games.  Just goes to show that sometimes you just have to be a little patient when a game has promise but starts out a little more difficult than you're used to.  Now, I stand by my comments about the graphics - they could be better.  However, once I got used to the control scheme, it worked great.  I'm a huge fan of this series, with Conviction being my favorite.  Double Agent is now my second favorite.  A must own...if you're a patient gamer.

I was half tempted to pay the extra money to make my GameCube Japan compatable just to play a harder game. I was appauled to find that he had reduced the difficulty of the game to suit American needs. He must have thought that Americans would have thought the games new graphic style to be, well, kiddy. Our economy would say no to that. If anything, you should keep it the same. America has the has the largest economy for games, man! Bigger than Japan! Give us some bang for our bucks. Come on Miyamoto. Zelda has left us enthralled for years, and we can take a change. I loved it!

Gameplay: 4/5. Good on land, but when you first get out at sea for the beginning of the game, it feels like slave labor moving the boat for 10-25 minute intervals. This added much of the time I spent on the game.

With that said, I was skeptical when I first saw Street Fighter IV.  Granted, it looked great but I wasn't too confident that it would ""feel"" like the old days.  Despite my reservations I bought SFIV yesterday and was blown away.  It feels so much like Street Fighter II, yet has been improved upon with not only the graphics but fighting system and moves as well.  The new additions offer a more dynamic fighter experience.  It's great to use the same old moves that are familiar but it's hard to beat landing a well-timed ultra combo.  The online play is the other great feature.  Arcade mode is fun and all, but the real joy is testing your skill with other players.

Whether you are an old school SF fan or just getting into it, definitely buy Street Fighter IV...it's well worth it.

5.0,True,"09 22, 2007",A34AB6PSS7QMHR,B00009XS6H,S. D. Johnson,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Toursist Trophy, I looked for something with a bit more structure and have been very satisfied with MotoGP 4. The focus of this game is MotoGP racing and includes all the bikes, riders, teams and tracks from the 2004 season in all three classes (125cc, 250cc, and MotoGP).  The three classes of racing are quite distinctly different in feeling and racing style, and each bike is different from the others in the same class, as well.

The heart of the game is the Season mode, where you can join the MotoGP circuit as a rookie on any of the various teams in the 125cc class. The better the team you choose, the better the result they expect from you. There are 16 races in the season and each race has a basic routine. First you engage in Free Practice, which allows you to learn the track and adjust your bike's settings for best performance on that particular track. Part of this will be due to your riding style and once you find something that works, it won't need much adjustment for other tracks, except to adjust top speed vs acceleration. Some tracks such as Mugello, will need higher speeds, while tracks with shorter straights will be better with lower top speeds and higher acceleration.

After you're comfortable with the track and your settings, you will run through Qualifying Practice. This gives you three laps to get the best possible time and will determine your position at the start of the race. Finally, you will do the actual race itself. The season can be set up to have races of 2 laps, 5 laps or full (about 21-28 laps, depending on the length of the track and the class you're racing). Regardless of length, you get a full grid of opponents to race against (18+ for MotoGP, more for the smaller classes).

During the season you will get the opportunity to test new parts for your bike, such as a new engine, better brakes, new fairing, etc. To get these you must complete a very difficult challenge, such as getting your bike above a certain speed by the time it crosses a line, or stopping within a coned area after racing down a long straight, but without any preparation.

Depending on your results in your first season, you may get offered a chance to ride in the 250cc class, again picking the team you want to ride for. Finally, after 2 seasons you may get a chance to enter the premier class - MotoGP.

In addition to Season play, there is an Arcade mode for one-off racing and both online and local multiplayer modes. The Time Trial mode allows you to use a ghost replay and also shows the racing line of the ghost image, allowing you to visually see what you did the previous time through, no matter where the ghost image may actually be.

A Challenge Mode includes 125 different Challenges. Completing a Challenge awards MotoGP Points and unlocks things you can ""buy"" with those points. The Challenges range from winning a championship in season mode to specific one-off riding trials and can be very difficult. The various trials include racing a section of track within a specific time, following a difficult pylon course on various tracks, and a ""survival"" mode where you run a continuous race of 1 lap each against increasingly good opposition riders and bikes.

The MotoGP points allow you to purchase various things from the store. These are generally unlocked and made available for purchase by completing Challenges. You can ""purchase"" new tracks (such as Suzuka '02), all the riders in each class for play in Arcade mode, and various videos and still images from both the game and real MotoGP. You can also unlock a Legends racing class, but I have yet to do that and can only imagine it goes back to the 500cc 2-stroke era.

One particularly enjoyable aspect of the game is getting to race against some of the sport's stars, especially facing the current ""young guns"" like Dani Pedrosa, Randy de Puniet, and Casey Stoner, while they were still in the 250cc class.

As for the graphics, I don't know what others are complaining about. There is plenty of detail, especially where it is needed in the track and the braking identifiers. There is less flash than in Tourist Trophy, but you get to race against a full grid of opponents on a wide range of bikes, instead of against just 2-5 opponents, sometimes all on the same model, as in TT.

Also unlike TT, there is a range of difficulty levels and the ability to race in wet conditions. You can choose between Easy, Normal and Hard for the opponent ability in races. This directly affects how fast they can go on each track. Next, you can turn on or off Sim mode and, if not in Sim mode, can turn on Automatic Braking, which means all you have to do is hold down the gas and steer, which is great for younger children. You can set the weather conditions of indivudal races in Arcade mode and can choose to race the season in all Dry, all Wet, or Randomly selected weather. Racing in the rain is a particular challenge in that you lose all your normal braking markers and must really know the track to be successful.

Highly recommended for any Racing Game fan, and especially to fans of motorcycle racing. This game is so good, I bought MotoGP 2 and MotoGP 3 used from 3rd party sellers to get a feel for the earlier seasons, including the transition year between 500cc and 990cc eras. MotoGP is a great sport and this game is a great presentation of the sport and a a lot of fun with literally hundreds of hours of gamplay!",Excellent presentation of the world's most exciting motorsport,1190419200,,,

I'll just say this is one of the best games of Playstation 2 I have ever played and the most underrated video game I've ever known. This is a 3D beat-em-up that avoids being repetitive by being difficult. You customize your own moveset and way you play, and mastering the game becomes nearly impossible by the balance system in place.

The better you play, the harder it gets in-game, going up 4 difficulity levels as you play. On Die, the hardest level, enemies can kill you in a couple hits. But you can always Beg For Mercy to make the game easier again. Playing it on its hardest not only gets you more rewards but tests your own limits and skill as well, which is where the true fun of the game comes from.

Other than your standard moves, you also get super moves, which are chosen by your roulette wheel. And you get the God Hand itself, which allows you temporary invincibility, strength, and speed. The game is hard enough though, where you'll need to save all of these for the hardest challenges or near-death moments. Even the best players will always have difficulty in this game. There's even an achievement (kind of) for playing through the game without using your God Hand and Roulette wheel. (A ""Kick-Me"" sign gets put on your back early in the game that goes away when you use the God Hand or Roulette, and the game challenges you to make it to the end with this sign still attached on you; which is nearly impossible!)

The game is just the right length, lasting about 8 hours or so, so it avoids getting stale, and by the time you get to near end, you'll be tired and exhausted (especially if you played all the way from the beginning in one sitting) but will still have enough energy to keep going and push through to the final fight.

The game also has an awesome sense of humor, cool characters, and great music, too. It's only downside, subjectively, would be the graphics. Or possibly, no multiplayer. That, and the fact that a sequel was never made. :(

God Hand is simply a cult classic and one of the best games you've probably never played. It's fun, difficult but fair, and just awesome, personified. Gene IS the God Hand. This is a must-play for any action game lover. I don't know who Clover Studios ticked off, because all the critics hated this, but ALL of them are dead wrong.

This one does improve on the past ones and doesn't try and stray far and make it into something it isn't by changing it a lot. The graphics are noticeably better and the gameplay is pretty smooth. The premise is pretty much the same. Start a band and play shows to become successful and unlock customization. One difference in it is that you can choose to do shows that give you more fans but less money and vice versa.

The guitar was not as great as MadCatz tried to make it seem it was going to be but it is definitely better feeling than the older ones (side note:I was sent a defective guitar that would strum down multiple times after a few strokes). I wasn't able to use my Singstar mics which is a downer but my old guitar and usb mic worked great.

The voting system is interesting and the freestyle solos I'll admit I am still getting used to because I am still not entirely sure how to properly do it. So far I'm not really a fan of them though

It does not have online but I can't say I miss that because it is more of a party game. I didn't even use it in Rock Band 2

For me the calibration worked fantastically. In the previous games no matter how many times I did it I could not get it to feel completely right.

I purchased Alpha Protocol for the PC only because it was less expensive than Xbox 360, however I later found out that it is very easy to earn a bunch of achievements in 1 playthrough, so in retrospect I should have purchased Alpha Protocol for my Xbox. Nonetheless, I found the game to be enjoyable. It is a 3rd person shooter/RPG similar to Mass Effect. There are mini-games to crack safes, hack computers, and bypass doors.

The inventory system is very easy to use, although it suffers many of the same problems as Mass Effect 1 where there are a bunch of different weapons in each family and you don't really know if they're good or not without quickly glancing at the specs. Many of these weapons are given fake names to avoid licensing issues with the real manufacturers. I saw the Remington/Bushmaster ACR, AK, FN SCAR among the assault rifles, and a few pistols. The weapon mods are plentiful and you can apply 4 different categories of mods.

The same goes for the battle armor, and you can carry up to 8 different gadgets depending on the capacity of the armor.

There are quite a few bugs and quirks in the PC game. When switching weapons, the zoom doesn't always work the first time so you have to push it repeatedly to get it to work. I chose to use my Xbox 360 controller to play the game on the PC, so it made the game easier to control except for aiming. The grenades aren't always tossed according to the dotted line, sometimes it hits invisible barriers and bounces back. This reminded me of Gears of War 2, except GoW had a better cover system.

The bypass, lock pick, and hacking mini-games got tiresome the first 300 times I had to use them. I later learned that having EMP grenades allows you to bypass the games but you can carry a finite number of EMP grenades on you at one time. The checkpoint saving is also very frustrating. To sum up this game, it is like a mix of Mass Effect and Gears of War.

I have been playing it non-stop for 2 months now every night for 2-3 hours and I still don't want to stop. Its a very addictive game. If you love comic book super-heroes and ever wanted to be one this is the game for you. Its as real as it gets. The graphics are excellent, the character creation is super and the mission are very entertaining. Its not a deep-rooted MORPG that people play like its their virtual life. Its a game to have fun with..just go out, be a one man army provide justice to the volience ridden city like only a super hero can and than logout and lead your actual life. I don't want to be spending hours running around shooting bunnies or crafting things for weeks to do anything meaningful(which is the forte of most MORPG out there). I just want a simple game that keeps my character progression and let me have pure fun. The game monthly fees is justified with the ever-changing new content NYC is delivering like 'Through the looking glass update' they just did. Nothing is for free, you watch a movie with your girlfriend you will end up spending twice of what you will pay for this game in a month. So its ok...I am willing to shell out $14 bucks if i can some good fun and relaxation after a hectic day at work.

They are two completely different games with two completely different styles.  Ok the first thing about this game that is amazing is the graphics.  I have never seen a more beautiful game.  The next thing is the fighting style, you have to take cover alot, and they make it really fun and interesting to do.  There is a small learning curve, but it is really easy and I think the new control scheme actually makes the game more realistic.  Of course shooting is still the same with the use of the trigger, but to aim you get to use the left trigger.  And you can aim while you are taking cover.  It differs from halo in that it is more strategic.  Instead of jumping in and shooting like a maniac, it actually requires you to take cover and be more  cautious about things.  However it is not completely stealth such as in the splinter cell series. This new formula of combining these two elements makes it very entertaining and realistic.  This is the most realistic game I ever played.  My adrenaline was pumping when the first boss came!  There are few games that I have played that make me jump put of my seat as if I am really there.  If you own a 360 you should already have this game.  If you dont, this game is worth buying a 360 for alone!  One complaint....  no jumping button.  However in reality if you were wearing 300 pounds of gear I don't think you would be able to jump.  That is my only complaint and with the absence of the jump button it actually makes the multiplayer so much more fun.  So not much of a loss there.  I will admit it was frustrating at first, especially since I use jump alot in Halo, but I am really glad with the omission.",AMAZING!,1163980800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"12 30, 2004",ARIHVRQ9VH0OQ,B0002RQ3ES,Nick Schwartz,"Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater, (said to be the last in the MGS trilogy, although a fourth has been announced) is not only the best game of the year, it is one of the best games ever made.  Gamers disappointed by the story and ""secret"" character in MGS2 Sons of Liberty need not worry; Snake Eater has no huge surprises, (although the plot does twist and turn).

  Snake Eater is a prequel to the first two MGS games; (and actually, I believe, takes place before the original Metal Gear as well).  It takes place in the 1960's, in the jungles of Russia, and as usual, a lone hero, 'Snake', is sent in to stop a nuclear battle tank from launching.

  Snake Eater is an enormous step forward for the series gameplay-wise.  Firstly, no longer do you have a radar.  You'll be utilizing various camaflouged uniforms to blend in to your surroundings and hide from enemies.  Also, since it is in a jungle, hiding from enemies is much more difficult.  No longer can you simply run around a corner or hide in a locker.  There are no corners or lockers, (save for a few instances when you arrive at enemy compounds).  You'll have to hide behind trees, on your belly in tall grass, or even up on a branch.

  New to combat is the CQC (Close Quarters Combat) system.  Get close enough to grab and enemy, and wealth of options are open to you.  Slit his throat; break his neck; throw him to the ground; use him as a human shield while shooting over his shoulder; or interrogate him for information.  Very cool, and very useful.

  Boss fights, and boss characters, as usual, are amazing.  The characters are intriguing, and the fights require skill and brainpower to beat.  PLus, instead of fighting in enclosed areas, some fights take place in the jungle, and one sniper duel in particular spans many screens, and a whole lot of space.

  The graphics are phenomenal, the best seen on the Playstation 2, and easily able to rival graphics found on competing systems.  Faces and character models are accurate and detailed, as well as extremely well animated.  The environments are huge, and varied.  Sun light streams down through the trees, fish swim in fast moving streams, snakes slither by you on the ground, and crocodiles sun themselves on small islands.

  Which brings me to another new aspect of the game: survival.  In addition to your health bar, you now have a stamina bar.  And instead of using rations to increase your health bar, your health will recover automatically over time, and the speed at which it recovers is directly determined by how much stamina you have.  Kill and eat food, (snakes, fruit, mushrooms, deer, rabbits, etc) to regain stamina.  If your stamina drops too low your aim will get shaky, and your wounds won't heal well.

  And on the subject of wounds, another new addition is the treatment of injuries you sustain during the game.  It is done through the pause menu, and you have to treat everything from broken bones, to burns, bullet wounds, and deep cuts.

  Add to all this the amazing story, and writing, plus the always unbelievably voice acting, (the MGS series blows all other games away in this department), and you've got yourself the game of the year.  I strongly suggest purchasing it.  I do not think you will be disappointed.",Perfect in Almost Every Way,1104364800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"06 19, 2003",A3BC8YL69NOCUP,B00004SPW9,MPG,"Square has always been known to develop quality titles and Vagrant Story proves its still one of the best in the game industry. Created by the same team who brought you Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story offers something quite different yet refreshing to the world of gaming. You are hero Ashley Riot, a Riskbreaker agent who chases the mysterious cult figure Sydney Losstarot into the city of Lea Monde. Throughout the game, you'll attempt to clear your name for being accused of murder while uncovering remnants of your past. Vagrant Story proves you don't need an overly epic storyline to make a game impressive, and this game definitely has one of the best scripts ever written for a video game.

Unlike other big-budget Square titles, which the storyline or visuals are the dominating aspects, gameplay is the star of Vagrant Story. As fair warning, this is NOT a game for casual gamers, which someone can just pick up and play. While battling, you target enemies' bodyparts with the use of a sphere grid. You'll learn to chain combos but your ""risk meter"" will rise, making you more vulnerable. You'll also learn to forge your own weapons and armor, do puzzle-solving and much more. The visuals are outstanding. You feel as if you really did visit Lea Monde with its dungeons and ruins. The character designs are equally amazing and the graphics push the PlayStation to its limits. Sound-wise, the music is hauntingly atmospheric and everything from the grunts and groans of monsters to the sounds of magic spells accent the game perfectly.

Although the difficulty level is a bit high and requires some patience and even frustration, it will still be an interesting but rewarding experience for anyone who really does get into it and understand the gameplay fluidly. The amount of time and effort you put into the game will determine how much fun will you have in the long run. You have to become deeply involved and immersed in order to enjoy Vagrant Story, but once you do, you'll realize you are playing one of the most unique games ever created. It's really like no other, even though it didn't receive enough recognition that it deserved. Give it a chance, it may grow on you.","Give it a chance, it may grow on you",1055980800,,,

And yes, the gameplay has been altered in a negative way.  However, any fan of Xenosaga is obligated to play this game.  Episode II contains exciting and emotional cut scenes, offers further development of the main characters and continues a deep yet interesting storyline.  Just be prepared for a few inferior modifications.

I, too, was disappointed with the change in voice actors, but I saw it coming and therefore wasn't overly bothered by it.  Not everyone sounds different; I only noticed Shion and KOS-MOS with different voices.  Thankfully, the characters' mannerisms and speech patterns have been left intact.  To me, that's what's important.

Another noteworthy downgrade is the music.  Episode I had a full symphony orchestra (with chorus) for it's soundtrack!  Not so with Episode II.  The music isn't bad by any means, but it's nothing that makes me want to buy the soundtrack CD, unlike the first game.  The sound effects are pretty much unchanged.

If you want to collect everything the game has to offer you must take on the optional sub-missions, called GS (Good Samaritan) Campaigns.  There are 36 of them, some of which are quite lengthy.  The time spent on these sub-missions is equal to, if not longer, than the main quest!  There's also Segment Files to discover, which Xenosaga veterans are familiar with.  They should have named this game's title Side-Questsaga.

Also, can anyone tell me why Episode II comprises two disks?  Episode I is only ONE disk, yet it has more cut scenes and is twice as long!  I suppose Episode III will comprise THREE disks and only be 1/3 as long as the first game..!  It's puzzling...

Oh, and why no database in this Xenosaga?  Episode I had a useful database of facts the player could access any time to keep track of all the terms, items and significant events in the game.  It was stupid to drop that feature.  There IS a brief recap of the events from Episode I available to read, but it doesn't make up for a missing database.

The one, single improvement over the first game is the removal of the mail/plug-in module system.  I found it annoying trying not to miss any of the items and information offered by the mail system attachments.  I was glad to see it go in Episode II.

Despite all the negatives, Xenosaga Episode II is still worth playing, at least for fans of Episode I.  Let's just hope for a grander epic in Episode III.  There's plenty to improve at this point.",Xenosaga's Brief 2nd Chapter,1131148800,5,,

If you want headphones so you can listen to music, but also want the mic for gaming or Skype, then I'd pass on these, personally. Even tho the product description says ""well defined highs"", in actuality they are muffled, and cloudy. When I plugged these in to a headphone splitter, and listened to them next to better quality headphones, the difference was huge. (Tho maybe its unfair to pay less than twenty dollars for headphones, then expect them to sound like two hundred dollar headphones.) Earphones I've tested in this price range, offer much better highs, than this set. I was listening to a Rolling Stone's song, and wondered, ""What happened to the guitar solo?"" It was there, but barely to be heard.  Also, these are not the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. There's no padding on the headrest, and the padding around the ears is a bit tight. After an hour or two, you're sure to have headphone fatigue, if you have a large skull.

ON the other hand, if you want gaming headphones, for playing video games, I think these would work great. In fact, if you're gaming for any length of time, the lack of high end would protect your hearing from nerve damage. If you are only listening to people talking, bottom heavy bomb explosions, or gun fire, these headphones will work fine. The mic flips down for on line chat with your gaming partners, or flips up and out of the way, when you need better vision of the screen. There's an ON/OFF switch, for the mic function, right next to the volume control.  I liked the volume control, in case you're getting sick of hearing that video music loop, or have one too many gun shots go off right in your ear.  Just turn it down for a second, while you concentrate on the game controls.  The mic and the headphones work with separate 1/8th inch jacks. Also, the design is simple, and contemporary. For gaming headphones, at this price, you should be happy. My own opinion is FOUR AND A HALF STARS, with the deduction due to the lack of highs, and sonic clarity and response. The bass sounds good, though. You shouldn't be disappointed there.

4.0,True,"06 12, 2012",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B004VQEO2E,Trenton Bennett,"Skylanders has to be the best use of an idea that I've seen to date:  it hits the kid-trifecta of video game/toy/collectible.  It makes parents happy with its game rating and content, and while it is only loosely based on Spyro the Dragon, I get the impression my dragon-loving daughter could care less because she's having too much fun.

If you're not familiar with the idea, here it is:  Skylanders are creatures (including Spyro) from another world who have been trapped inside little toy figurines.  The Skylanders game comes with a ""Portal of Power"", a wireless base that you can put within reach of you while you play the game.  When you plunk a Skylander figure down on the Portal of Power, they come to life in the game (and the Starter Pack gives you three).  Within the game world, everything looks like a fantasy playset.  Players go on adventures helping the little creatures that live in each world (and we get some entertaining voice acting, such as Patrick Warburton).  Each Skylander has unique powers, and each falls into one of several types (Fire, Water, Air, Tech, etc.).

Each figurine has its own skills.  Each type is useful--and sometimes necessary--to complete certain parts of a level.  You'll hear ""Skylanders of the Air type are stronger here"", or see ""A Fire type Skylander is necessary to unlock this door""...plunk the right type down on the Portal and you're ready to go.  The goal of the game is to enjoy trying out all the different kinds of Skylanders and switch them about on the fly, so it never gets boring.  And as each figurine ""levels up"", the money you gather along the way will let you buy various powers and upgrades, but all of it stays with that toy.  Take the toy over to a friend's house, drop it on their Portal of Power, and you're playing right alongside them, with all your skills and levels.  It's even ""platform-agnostic"", which means any Skylanders figure will work on any machine at any time:  the PS3, the Wii, the Nintendo DS, and even the PC.  My daughter plays on the PS3 and her friend has the Wii--both games play anyone's Skylanders without a hitch.

The dark side of Skylanders is the 'collectible' part.  As you play the game, you'll unlock goodies that certain Skylanders can have.  You'll see an animation of the Skylander and a clip of how they work in the game...but you can't play that Skylander and give them the goodie if you don't have the toy for that Skylander.  And some toys are less common than others.  Some are in more demand, and many are selling online by adults who make the rounds at your local toy stores and buy up everything in sight.  While the initial run of Skylanders is 32 figurines, there are most likely plans to make more kinds, but the ones that have been made won't be made forever:  their production run is limited.  Your child doesn't have to have every Skylander to enjoy the game (and maybe they shouldn't!) but chances are you'll run across one particular hard-to-find Skylander that your child really wants to have, and then you'll have to decide how much you're willing to pay for it.  Amazon is your friend:  they connected me to someone with Cynder--girl characters are hard to find, and she is my daughter's favorite.

Still, Skylanders is tremendous fun to play.  It is colorful, it allows two players to play together with the ability for either player to come and go if they want to quit, and it even tags figures to the savegame in which they were unlocked.  This last doesn't change gameplay in any way, it just means that if you have two siblings with their own figures, each can have their own savegames that note that the figure was first plunked down in that savegame.  Siblings with duplicate Skylanders can give each nicknames to tell them apart.  And as if that wasn't enough, the Expansion Sets are a clever, clever way to add more to the game--drop the figure for the expansion on the Portal of Power and the expansion playset gets dropped into the Skylanders world for play.  My daughter has a 'health potion' that you can put on the Portal once per level, and while it's there, players' health regenerates for a period of time.  Amazing stuff.

I tell ya, if we'd had Skylanders when I was a kid, chances are I would have totally ignored 'that Star Wars thing that everyone seems to be talking about.'  Skylanders is pure play/toy/game heaven.",Pure Play Perfection,1339459200,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

As a controller converter, it does its job well with no lag input. The device's drivers are kept up-to-date on ConsoleTuner's website with community-made mods available. The converter's drivers allows tons of customization for turbo function and controller input. I personally use the Titan One to get my last-gen arcade sticks to work on the Xbox One, and suffice to say, it works very well. There is even a driver option where the device locks itself in a mode called ""Tournament Mode"" with a ""T"" displaying on the device's display for those who compete in fighting game tournaments, where turbo function et al are disabled.

The converter is made with solid plastic and is pretty durable. I've dropped it once or twice and carried it around a lot in a bag and it still works to this day. The converter fits well into USB inputs and does not budge when wiggled. One thing though is that USBs inserted into the converter's USB input has to go in upside-down. It's not really a problem and is more likely a design choice to make the device itself small and compact.

Continuing on with the device's list of caveats:

- The initial set-up was a little difficult. Instructions can be found on their website, but it was also a bit difficult navigating ConsoleTuner's site for the instructions.
- The device requires a WIRED controller for the console of choice of which you want to get another controller to work on. So for example, if you want to get an Xbox One controller to work on PS4, you will need a PS4 controller.
- Every time you remove the converter from the console, the device does not retain the output of the device, so you will have to set-up the converter again if it leaves the console's USB. However, the converter will identify controllers within seconds.
- Apparently the PS4 has issues with the converter's compatibility requiring the device to reboot itself every 10 minutes. ConsoleTuners is currently working on a workaround, but PS4 owners will have to deal with that. The rebooting process takes like a second, but in a competitive setting, this is an issue.

Other than that, for $70, you can't go wrong with this converter. It's a solid buy if you can get around its caveats. No modding or real computer skills required.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To convert a controller:

1: Insert converter into the USB input of console of choice (e.g. PS4).
2: Insert the wired input of the console's controller (e.g. PS4 controller) into converter's USB input upside-down.
3: Wait a bit. The converter will identify the controller and will display a notification that the controller has been identified.
4: Remove controller's wired USB from the converter.
5: Insert the wired input of desired controller (e.g. Xbox One controller) into the USB of the device upside-down.
6: Wait a bit. The converter will identify the Xbox One controller and convert its signal into the console of choice.
7: Test controller.",Solid Converter That is Well Worth the Investment,1436400000,9,,

Before this game, I have never played UT. I would say it is also a fairly reasonable entrance to the UT franchise

Graphics. Yes, it is the year 2008 (or later, depending on when you are reading this review), so I will not be harsh on the game's graphics. For its time, UT2004 has stunning graphics. Throughout the game, you will have many of those breath-taking moments were you can see a gorgeous map in all its glory.

Sound. Appropriately technological. The sound builds on the supspense in the game, and seems to fit in very well with the levels. It is not really anything to take notice of, just there. Weapon sounds are good, but do not really vary, it is tedious hearing the same sounds over and over while using a weapon. If you play the game without sound, you are not really missing anything big.

Gameplay. This is where UT stands out, the gameplay in this game is superb. The game is polished to the extent that you will never really notice any bugs. The game comes with 15 unique weapons, each with at least one atternate firing mode. For example, the rocket launcher can fire a single rocket (LMB/RMB), it can fire two of three rockets (hold RMB), it can fire multiple rockets in a spiral pattern (hold RMB and tap LMB), and finnaly, it can lock on to a target (hold crosshair over an enemy). Each of the weapons are unique and extremely balanced. For this Epic's game policy is ""No weapon is completely overpowering, but in the right hands, any weapon can be overpowering."" There are olso vehicles in the popular onslaught game mode. Each one is completely original and fun to use. Along with that you have close to 150 maps to play in plus downloadable content and the ablity to create your own maps.

Multiplay. Well, the whole game is for multiplayer. And although there is a single player mode, it is a little bland in terms of fun. But with real opponents, the fun just never stops! If you do not have internet connection, this game is not really for you.

Replayability. It is just impossible to stop loving this game.

Story. No story, well at least, not really. In the assault modes, there is a glimmer of a story line that tells the history of the Unreal universe, but it is utterly confusing, and doesn't really give you any motivation to play this game.

UT2004 is a fun, and polished shooter that is right up there with Halo and Call of Duty.

I got this when DS first came out (so there were only a handful of decent games) and it was o.k. It's a very straight forward concept with an extremely shallow overtone. Sure, it's a dating sim, but the objective is clear: they wanted to appeal to a larger American demographic by making it like some rich kid MTV 'reality' show.

The gameplay (if you wish to call it such) is linear and there is very little room for movement. Sure there are alternate endings, but they have very subtle differences. Sound is okay; it's very generic and over time very unbearable.

The restricted nature, low replay value, and poor story line makes this game barely passable if you're a dating sim fan, and I'd assume less so if you weren't.

I also think they have inexperienced/inadequate development teams working on some of their titles. And apparently, when going in and fixing this or that is too costly or time consuming, they just add a new feature or two to gloss over the remaining crappy elements included in this title. I bought this game with little expectations, I read the reviews and said, how bad can it be? I've played Live 08, and it wasn't that bad. But this is BAD!!! The frame rate, as you may have read is really the issue. Players jerk and jostle about. You'll step out of bounds without trying, get locked into an animation as you go to the net and again, run out of bounds. The opponent double teams and intentional fouls you if you're winning with less than a minute to go - which sends you out of bounds to pass it in - which is incredibly annoying the 5th time it happens. But it's not all bad. I like the college feel, the arenas feel alive, the mascots, cheerleaders, etc. all feel like NCAA football. The low post play is pretty solid, as you can rely on an easy bucket by flicking the right analog stick when the defense posts up and move right on around him. Most players instead of a dunk do a up and under move that's pretty reliable as well. Still, the frame rate is the biggest nail in this games coffin. And where is the game you see in the screen shots? or even in the in-game opening preview after the title screen? A few more close ups of the pretty decent looking player models would be nice, heck if they can get the graphic quality to anything close to what you see when you win or lose and congratulate the other team, then this might be something to write a positive review about. But nope, it's just skinny kids playing ball. Eh, skip it!

Add-on 8/29: After playing this game awhile, it's starting to grow on me. Yeah the above issues are still there. But, if you slow the game down on the sliders to a snails pace, the gameplay is actually quite solid. I've enjoyed the mini games before each game and I like how it transitions from the playground to the arena, where all the fans cheer or boo as you make and miss shots. The recruiting part is actually kind of fun, sending emails, packages, scholarships, etc. are all fun. And like I said before, as college goes, it's really cool to play in the arena's with the mascots, fans, cheerleaders, etc. That might be because I didn't go to a big school, so I missed out.

This is a true, nut-and-bolt recreation of pen and paper Dungeons and Dragons.  The rules are extremely complicated and detailed, and the game takes place in turns.  Thus, it plays more like a turn-based strategy game than past RPGs like Baldurs Gate and Neverwinter Nights.  A simple combat against five bandits might take 60 seconds in previous games, but it can take 10 minutes in this game.  In general, the pace of this game is very slow.  I think that Troika did a great job of making a game that is both faithful to D&D rules and fun, but the game is really lacking some basic features.
By now, you have probably figured out that this game is not for everyone.  It isn't.  If you don't like +1 bonuses, die rolls, and inane rules, then you are going to hate this game.  However, if you are like me and you like a lot of this stuff, then this game seems like Nirvana.  It's almost a perfect recreation of D&D, and it's very efficient.  All of the rules, feats, skills, spells, and actions have been distilled down into a simple set of menus and screens that you can access with a few mouse clicks.  For the most part, it's intuitively set up and very easy to use.  The radial menu system works great.  If you know the D&D rules well, then you will be at full speed in no time.
It's impossible to overstate what an accomplishment this is.  You just right click on a character and by navigating the mouse, you can either drink a potion from your inventory, use the ""Power attack"" feat, or cast a Magic Missile spell.  The ease of use is one of the reasons why the game stays fun.
Combat in ToEE is the most fun and satisfying part.  The battles are extremely hard and they require you to utilize all of the tactical tricks that you can think of.  The turn-based system is what allows you to do this and get anything out of it.  I enjoyed the combat in this game more than Baldurs Gate or Neverwinter Nights for this reason.  The game doesn't blow by too fast for you to use your abilities without pressing the space bar over and over.
This game has surprisingly good graphics.  The pre-rendered 2D backgrounds are simply the most beautiful that I have ever seen.  They are not only gorgeous, but full of variety.  The monsters are also richly detailed, not to mention menacing.  The monsters are also the best that I have ever seen in an RPG.  My only complaint with the graphics is how tiny your party is on the screen.  You can hardly tell your characters apart without squinting, and you can't tell what they are carrying or wearing by glancing at them.  The inventory screen is also very unattractive and the items are very bland.  Baldurs Gate and Neverwinter Nights have much more attractive inventory screens.
I love the soundtrack for this game, but the voice acting is pretty sub par.  A few of the characters have good voice acting, but for the most part, it's not very good.
This game does have some problems that slow it down unnecessarily.  One of them is the inability to set hotkeys.  Customizable hotkeys was one of the great things about Neverwinter Nights.  Unfortunately, in Temple of Elemental Evil, in order to give a command 20 times, you have to go through it in the radial menu 20 times.  It gets old.  The map screen stinks, because you can only place a limited number of flags on it, and because you can't use it to jump to a spot on the big screen,  Finally, the manual that comes in the box is totally inadequate.  You need to buy the Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook to understand a lot of what is going on (if you don't already know).  I see this as being a huge flaw for someone who is not intimately familiar with the rules.
I really enjoyed this game, and I hope that we will see more Dungeons and Dragons games from Troika.  As I said previously it is not for everyone.  If you like planning and strategy, then I think that you will like this game.  You might want to get a strategy guide with it, because this is also the hardest D&D game ever made.","Promising, but lacking some basics",1064361600,13,,

4.0,False,"08 15, 2007",A12RYA1QNP9HOG,B000P0QJD2,V,"Ladies and Gentlemen... I give you Madden 06 for the XBox 360.

Madden 06?  Well...  yeah.  This is the version that should have been for 06.  2007 at the least.  But we won't harp on that - we'll just go off of this game and what we have here now.  And what we have here now is a pretty good game, I must admit.

To start off, let's remember that Madden 07 SUCKED.  Plain and simple.  If you thought otherwise, then... well, to quote the late Rick James: ""Cocaine is a hell of a drug.""  I reviewed it harshly, but accurately.  (It's the first one that displays)  I said - nay - SWORE that I would not buy another EA football or basketball title until they showed us, as consumers, that they were interested in putting out a quality product and less interested in that '#1 Selling Franchise' logo on the box every year.  I missed playing football games, as I usually do around this time of year, so I picked up NCAA 08.  I enjoy the college versions usually, and that one was no different.  Some of the upgrades on there had me a little curious about what they had in store for this year's Madden, so I kept my eyes open.  But I swore to myself - RENT first.

So I did... played a few games, different modes, etc.  Then a funny thing happened.  I went right back out and bought it.  Wow...  didn't see that coming.  And even more surprising than that, I guess, for some - the FAR BETTER version is on the 360 and NOT the PS3.

So let's see... where to start.  I'll start with the cons, since there aren't many of them this year, surprisingly.  But the ones that ARE there are biggies, and keep this game out of the 'Great' category and firmly in the 'Very Good' area.  (still better than last year's 'Rancid Camel $&?!#' rating)

New England is rated at a 97.  Okay, that's not really a 'con' but COME ON...  a 97?  Really??  Anyway...

Presentation - pitiful.

For a game that has exclusive rights to the ESPN brand, this is really horrible.  Games past utilized FAR superior presentation styles - including those that were ESPN licensed.  With all of the classic on-air/broadcast personalities over at ESPN, all they could come up with was Marshall Faulk doing a glazed-over pre/post game two-liner?  All-Pro Football 2K8 was a half-hearted attempt by the 2K Crew, yet it is not UTTERLY behind Madden - why?  Presentation.  The audio commentary, the little subtleties in the gameplay: players actually talking to one another and the ref, players getting out of the way of oncoming traffic while standing on the sidelines, etc.  Why does this seem to remain just out of EA's scope of imagination?  Play-by-Play is still a joke this go-round.  Madden was never on par with the classic 2K series, but this radio broadcast thing - doesn't work for me, and from what I'm hearing - doesn't work for most others.  I actually miss Madden's painfully OBVIOUS-isms. (""What you wanna do is... you wanna score more points than the other team, because THAT will put you in a better position to win the game.""  Thanks for that pearl of wisdom there, JM) Also gone is the ability to truly customize your menu playlists.  I hate that.  I want my own music.  Period.

I don't play online as much as in the past, but one rather large omission I noticed was the lack of Online Leagues.  Hmmmm...  that seems like it would add MILES of replayability, yet again, it's nowhere to be found.  Disappointing, moreso for some I'm sure.

And of course there are a few gameplay issues, but that's to be expected.  AI has been drastically improved, but there are still moments when your DB's and LB's will prove to be mildly retarded.
You fumble FAR too often on this game - the ball is too easily jarred loose, thanks in large part to the Hit Stick controls, but after awhile you kinda get used to it a bit. (annoying in itself)

EA 4th Quarters are still in effect: No matter how badly you've been destroying a team for 3 quarters, they will manage to drive down and score on you in the 4th.  Bumping the difficulty up a notch or two helps somewhat this year - I keep it on All-Madden.  Speaking of AI - how about a little AI upgrade for the crowd, coach and sideline players?  The fans are still there, cheering like psychos, even though their team is down by 48 in the closing seconds of the game.  Not likely...  The sideline players are still over there in their overly-generic animations, all moving in sync with each other - looks like an old Michael Jackson video.  And my coach, even in the snow, is over there getting his Kanye West on with a short-sleeved polo shirt and a headset.  36 degrees out, Coach...

There's still no way to save mid-game, though they did incorporate the SuperSim feature from NCAA 08.  You can (pre-game or pre-play selection) choose to simulate the entire game, quarter, half, possession or play.

The other biggie (besides the presentation) is the Special Teams play.  It effectively serves no purpose on this game.  The kicking game is still overly simplistic, every kicker has the ability to kick the ball out of the stadium, there are no useful adjustments for kickoff/punt formations (wedge, etc.)  Also, if the other team DOES manage to score, expect an onside kick.  50-point deficit in the 4th still?  Onside kick...  Why?  WHY???  Football is, when you get down to it, made up of 3 elements: Offense, Defense and Special Teams.  That's 1/3 of the game.  1/3 that they failed to represent.  Can't have a 'Great' game with those percentages.

Thankfully, the rest of the game is rather outstanding.

Graphically, the game is so far ahead of last year's it's not even funny.  Gone are the kickers with the 27-inch pythons.  You can tell Peyton Manning apart from Brian Urlacher.  Players are far more realistically portrayed in this installment.  Slow down a HB in the open field just long enough for 2 of your DB's and a safety to swarm in and gang tackle him into the turf. (FINALLY!!!!!)  The new animations (literally hundreds) make for a much smoother and free-flowing gaming experience, and the intuitive button configuration (fully customizable, of course) helps in just jumping straight into a game.

The stadiums are very nicely done, and the field looks phenomenal - PARTICULARLY during bad weather.  You see the destruction of the field in the heavy traffic areas, and it progresses throughout the game.  Even the rain itself tapers on and off throughout.  One suggestion:  how about some splashing, and more evidence of the messy weather on the uniforms/helmets.  The lack of water splashing kind of takes away from the beauty of the huge pools of water that you are being forced to hike the ball from.

Aside from the radio broadcaster, the sound is brilliant.  On-field trash talking, stadium announcer - everything is there.  The tackling sounds will actually have you cringe occasionally... especially if it's one of YOUR players that just got their head knocked off.

I mentioned the AI - leaps and bounds over 07.  Minus a few lapses here and there, you really have to use some THOUGHT when playing.  I actually enjoy PUNTING now!!  Throw to a receiver near the sidelines, and watch him (gasp) actually make an attempt to stay inbounds while catching the ball.  Loose ball?  Be amazed at how a mad dash will instantly ensue.  Gone are the days when a goalline stand was a mere formality.  1st and Goal on the one?  Don't be surpised if you end up with 3 points...

All of the other gameplay features appear to be back, more or less.  Instead of a dedicated 'Owner Mode' you can check in the Front Office menu and observe how your Franchise is running.  Check prices (can't adjust them though), revenue, expenses... even RELOCATE your team somewhere more profitable if your market is slow with the money.  Drafts, stats, roster management - pretty much the norm.  And all of the other little stuff, like the Rings, Trophies, yadda yadda - not that much into that crap, but they're there if you want them.  Connect to XBox Live and the ESPN Ticker will keep you updated with current stats and news in real time.  (I got several Michael Vick updates yesterday... nice)

Madden annually introduces some new gimmick to the franchise in an attempt to make it 'fresh' - this year brings us the Weapons System.  While it can use some tweaking for sure, this is - to me - the single best addition to this franchise since the ability to change your pass coverage came along.  Along with the traditional ratings system, you now have a Weapons system, labeling players by their strenghts and tendencies.  No longer are two 99-rated WR's mirror images of one another.  Steve Smith and T.O. are both great receivers for different reasons.  L.T. and L.J. are definitely different types of backs, but you'd never know it on previous Maddens.  Power backs play differently that elusive backs; Speed receivers go differently than possession receivers.  For every Weapon, there is a counter Weapon.  Hard Hitters can counter a Power HB by taking their legs out from under them consistently, but would have a harder time taking out an elusive back - while THEY would have more trouble with a Brick-Wall defender or LockDown defender.  See?  And it's up to you to set mismatches and play to your strengths and your opponent's weaknesses.  Smart players - there's nothing you can really do to counter them outside of choosing a vast variety of plays - don't become predictable.  Once your Smart Player's icon illuminates fully, they are able to see the play art of the opponent.  QB's will see the defense's plan - LB's will see the offensive play between the hash marks.  This all adds up to provide a football experience than Madden lovers haven't had, arguably, ever.

So how does it rate?  A solid 4 out of 5 for me.  The presentation and gameplay issues I mentioned earlier keep it from the 4.5-5 realm, but the KEY is that they are progressing.  The REAL TEST will be when 09 comes out - what will that be like?  Hopefully it's a step forward and not backwards, which has been EA's pattern over the past few years.

Is it the best football game ever?  No.
Is it better than 2K5?  Not hardly.
Is it the best football game for 08?  I'd have to say yes... slight nod over NCAA 08 (though the collegiate 'little brother' does more on the presentation end)
Is it better than Madden 07?  Ridiculously so, but again - that's not saying much.  So how about this:
Is it the best Madden ever?  Hmmm... that's tough.  It's at least where 05 was, which was arguably the best Madden.  I've had more fun with this year's Madden than I have in a LONG time.  So for me, I'd have to say... yes.

Much improved - very good effort from EA.  It's about time.  This game is a few gameplay tweaks, a massive presentation overhaul, and some miscellaneous additions (tats, unique animations, custom soundtracks, etc.) from being something TRULY special.  But thanks for finally giving me something to look forward to again each August.

Steering with the wiimote adds a fun element that is a bit hard to get used to at first, but does add some interest to the steering.

The wii wheel was kind of dumb. I finally just took my wiimote out of the wheel, because with a wheel, I want to, you know, turn it like a steering wheel! But in order to get anywhere you need to tip the wiimote back and forth. Steering normally does nothing, and the wheel was just frustrating because it made me want to steer rather than tilt back and forth.

The other annoying thing is that with multiplayer, you can't play the races straight through without interruptions (Grand Prix), and you can't seem to select between 50 cc, 100 cc, and 150 cc.

BE WARNED.  Sadly, the B button on this device - BRAND NEW mind you, is terribly unresponsive and requires really forcing your thumb into what feels like placing a puzzle for the dang button to register. Worse, once you've pressed and are holding down B, the controller doesn't register you holding it down, as it slips around and requires crushing power (following a response delay that cannot be overcome by strength) just to execute any moves than require, uh... B.  I paid as much as a new controller for this, and perhaps note no other issues with any of the buttons - will possibly reconfigure the keys around as in smash having both x and y and the analog pad up serve as a jumping action is a little overkill.

5.0,False,"06 30, 2003",A2TUCS8O6AJXKJ,B000083JTP,--,"Video games have been stealing from the ""Evil Dead"" movies for quite some time now. Take Duke Nukem, for instance - he really wants to be Ashley Williams, when it's all said and done, and that's why he steals the ""Evil Dead"" hero's quips whenever he spills the entrails of some invading alien. Oh, and what of Caleb, the undead anti-hero of the ""Blood"" series? Yes, he too owes the majority of his one-liners to Mr. Williams - who we have come to know as `Ash.' Let's face it, ""Evil Dead"" is the perfect movie-to-game property, and Ash, chainsaw-armed hero of the films, is the perfect gaming bad@$$. When it comes right down to it, it doesn't even matter how well ""Evil Dead: A Fistful of Boomstick"" plays, provided Bruce Campbell returns to voice Ash. Fortunately for us ""Evil Dead"" fanatics, Campbell is back, and the game plays pretty darn well too. You're in for some good, unclean fun, you primitive screwheads.
The story picks up sometime after the end of the third film, and we find Ash tilting a few back in his favorite bar in his quaint hometown of Dearborn, Michigan. Naturally, things aren't quaint for very long. A spectacle-toting professor reads an ancient arcane passage from the Deadites' favorite book on a local television broadcast, and it all goes downhill from there. The inhabitants of Dearborn begin to change into slavering undead freaks - and it's up to Ash and his boomstick to save the day.
The storyline is appropriately campy in a fashion that is consistent with the franchise, but otherwise unremarkable. Just the same, it provides all the motivation you will require to dismember hordes upon hordes of Deadites. The game plays out in a way best described as ""Tomb Raider"" meets ""The Thing,"" and the action, while a little bit on the repetitive side, is slick and bloody. Ash will uncover more ways to dispose of the opposition than you, as the player, will ever have time to use in one play-through, and it's just plain addictive. Some puzzles crop up to offset the mayhem, and they provide some welcome cerebral moments that are rarely illogical.
During the course of the game, Ash will venture through present day (but Deadite-infested) Dearborn, colonial Dearborn, Civil War era Dearborn, and post-apocalyptic Dearborn. This time travel scenario provides some much-appreciated variety in the locales, and an ""Army of Darkness"" ambience besides. It all looks pretty nice too - crisp and colorful, and fraught with detail. Only the segments of the game that take place in the forests around Dearborn are unattractive, point of fact, and that's saying something when you consider that this is a budge title retailing at about $20. What's more, the character models, while not bursting with detail, are very well animated, and usually quite convincing.
Any ""Evil Dead"" fan looking forward to this game is probably asking: ""So, how are Ash's one-liners?"" The answer to that is this: not bad, but not half as well-written as the ones from the films (which is to be expected). Even so, Bruce Campbell's delivery compensates for even the worst of them, and his vocal presence alone is worth the price of admission. Besides, there are some hidden gems scattered here and there that will tickle Deadite aficionados in all the right places. Add to that some well-made cut-scenes (and a BRILLIANT finale), and you've got the closest thing to ""Evil Dead 4"" you're going to see... at least for quite some time.
It's not all unbridled joy, though. The game is a bit on the short side, and requires a lot of backtracking and errand running. Boss battles are not very intense, and the solutions to defeating them are all but spelled out for you in a most unsubtle fashion. As an ""Evil Dead"" fan myself, I was also a bit disappointed by some of the enemies in the game, which don't really fit in the ""Evil Dead"" universe, and seem to have come instead from an entirely different game.
As a game, without any other considerations, ""Evil Dead: Fistful of Boomstick"" is good. It plays well, offers a few scares and a few laughs, and a whole lot of M-rated action. As an ""Evil Dead"" fanatic, the game delivers all of the above and the added delight of revisiting Ashley Williams and watching him kick all kinds of Deadite @$$. Finally, as a budget title, this game represents pure excellence. In a rare twist of fate, just because you're paying less doesn't mean you're getting less. Hail to the king, baby.

4.0,False,"08 14, 2004",A12WNZECREFGBE,B00025EJ1E,Hossmann,"As you know, I gave a pretty harsh rating to Rainbow Six 3 due to its online bugs which are history now (Action Replay and Molotov Cocktails to name a few) and the decent at best menu music really disturbed my judgement of the game. What Black Arrow does is give us what wasn't available to us in RS3 (2 new online modes, lone rush, co-op) but it's those few online bugs that gives this game one star less than what it deserves.

Pros: 1. Lone Rush Mode (kill terrorists alone like Schwartzenegger!)

2. Co-op terrorist hunts and missions (play with a friend, and it's cordless too!)

3. New Multiplayer modes (Total Conquest has you control all three satellites for 20 seconds from the other team and Retrieval is like CTF, except with a cannister instead of a flag, same objective though)

4. Xbox Live 3.0 is fully utilized (clan support, voice messaging, and clan competitions!)

5. New menu music (it actually rocks!)

6. Improved AI and sound (terrorists actually put emphasis in being shot or spotting you)

Cons: 1. Online Bugs. I will just explain these bugs to you. As I said before, these bugs were the only reason that I gave this game a 4-star instead of a 5-star. Trust me, the online in whole is a good experience, but it is these bugs that taint the image of the game. Here are the bugs that you will encounter in your online quest.

One, The AOL-ism when you enter a game. Once you enter a game, you go through the loading screens, map loading, and so on. And then you get through into a game you hear people on the speakers or headset, you hear music,... but all of a sudden, the music and chatter stops, and after 1-3 seconds, you see an play screen with no movement except for the loading circle on the bottom. About 5 seconds later, I found myself sitting in the main menu. Not only that, but it also boots you from the Xbox live service and you have to reconnect to the Live service! I have discovered that I can rarely get into a game when they are actually playing. I must wait until the game goes back into the waiting lobby before I can join it! Hopefully, Ubisoft will release a patch to fix this up (Apparently, there are always online bugs with the Ubisoft games. RS3 (Action Replay), SC-PT (quit and don't lose points and game is not ranked), and this game to be specific. What are the online testers doing?)

Two, Spawn Camping. UUUUUUGGGGGHHHHH!!! This problem is basically a problem with the newer online modes, where another team gets through to their spawn and just shoots everyone on the other team that respawns. Not only does it agitate the team that is getting spawn killed, but it takes the fun out of the game as well (I expected a challenge, not to just shoot people respawning!). I'll admit it to you, I have spawn killed before (did not initiate it, but joined in the process) and it is only fun to do for about 30 seconds to a minute, then it just gets boring. Either because you get sick of it, or the other team just quit or stopped respawning. And the attacking team has the advantage as well since you cannot move for a half second where they just shoot you and you, yes, die. Once again, where are the online testers on this sort of thing. Shouldnt Ubisoft have put up barriers on spawns or a time limit for being in the opponents spawn area (10 seconds tops) but no, We have to suffer until Ubisoft puts out a patch to stop this madness.

Three, you quit and your stats do not count for the game. It's self-explanitory. quit and the game will not count for or against you, it's not as bad as splinter cell where a player quit and the game didn't count, but it still irks me that this hasn't been fixed for a game that has been released AFTER Splinter Cell.

Final Verdict: I would still buy this game, since many people will abandon RS3 for the expansion pack, and besides, if you look past the online bugs, it is a very good game. and it's only $40. Good price for the game.","Great solo campaign, but frustrating online bugs deceive me",1092441600,6,,

As the battery life is terrible, only about 6-10 hours (and that's in power saving mode,) you will find you need to keep it charged whenever not in use, keep spare rechargeable batteries around, or plug it in and use it that way. With the weight of the mouse, it SHOULD have used 2 AA rechargeable batteries instead of 1 to at least give you a full day of usage.

Unfortunately the Logitech charging cable is thick and very stiff, needlessly so. As an alternative, I just use a regular micro-USB cable which works fine. It doesn't have the strain-relief of the Logitech, but as it's rather thin it seems to be fine.

The software is horrible both from a design and coding viewpoint. For example, in the definable profiles, you can set the DPI and report rate. For some reason, it takes 4 seconds for it to respond to a click changing the report rate or DPI up and down arrows. I don't know how anyone could possibly code something to perform this poorly on a core i7-3930K,  but not only should they be fired, but they should be barred from ever working in the software industry again. From a design perspective, you can assign multi-key macros to the extra buttons. The UI is bizarre though, you can enter key strokes but in order to also include mouse events, you have to right click on the keystroke window and choose insert mouse event....  Very non-intuitive. At the very least there should be an on-screen note to right click to do other actions. Also, in a macro, there is no way to have the macro send one thing on button down, and another on button up (which would be VERY useful.)

All that said, as a mouse, it works very well. It tracks fast and accurately and despite the design flaws of the software, once you set it up you are good to go. Being able to change DPI on the fly is awesome, as is having multiple profiles. For this reason, I'm giving it 4 stars but can't give it 5 stars due to the flaws listed above. You would think after being in the mouse business for so long Logitech would be 5 stars every time, but this just isn't the case with this mouse.

Update1: The USB receiver failed and I had to work with support to get it replaced. Really - that's a part that should never fail.

The ending was terrible in my opinion. If you're going to play this game for the story, you're going to be sadly disappointed.

Gameplay: It's all about parkour and combat. You'll be climbing/ sliding/ jumping through different obstacles. The open-world game was not a bad idea, but clearly, there's was a huge potential. Combat feels weird. This game clearly wants you to always be moving, but the combat prevents it. There's only two types of attacks: your standard normal and heavy. While you are able to knock your opponent in a different direction, the problem is the whole combat system. They honestly should've had a combo system against the enemies within the game. Also, the enemies aren't that great. Only one would try to fight you while the others would just watch their own teammates get their ass whoop. You have gadgets within the game, but AGAIN there is a huge potential for the use of gadgets in combat.

Some reviews have said it's too easy. I guess that depends how hardcore of a gamer you are. I guess I would consider myself a casual gamer, as I don't have time with work and a family to play all the time, but when I do play, it's games like this that I really enjoy.

The graphics and sound make for a really immersive experience, especially if you have good surround sound. There were numerous times I had goose bumps and was actually spooked a few times. Also, you are selling yourself short if you aren't set up for HDTV with the quality of games today. Playing this game on anything but 1080p is a disjustice to the game and your personal experience.

This game adds some different skills to the typical first person shooter. I really like the zero gravity. And the storyline is top notch and molds seamlessly with the game.

The power-ups hidden in the game were a thrill to find.  Learning all the maps proved most difficult and beating Kraid, the boss of the underground was as far as I got for years.  Why?  Cause I always ended up copying the stupid complicated password down wrong and could not continue. (Its crazy if you didn't already know.)
I finally beat the game in my sophmore year of highschool (without any outside help) after exploring every crany nook with my bombs and having the map of the entire game practically memorized.  That my friends is key to metroid, memorizing where you have gone which proved most difficult to do when I was a child.  Yes I killed Kraid, went to the statues and blasted Motherbrain to oblivion, and finally beat the hardest game in my youth - next to Kid Icarus- still haven't beaten it and probly never will...

4.0,False,"04 16, 2009",A3KZ7OH4VRL048,B000CA5FLW,Jonathan,"I'm writing this review from the point of view of a casual gamer who only plays against the computer; I like being able to quit a game whenever I feel like it. So, obviously, I'll only be commenting on the single-player modes.

The campaign modes of the game features nothing from the movies proper, instead focusing on the ""War in the North"" - the Goblins versus the Elves and Dwarves. The campaign is comparatively short, featuring only about 1/3 of the missions of the original BFME, presented in a fixed order. However, the locales and actual missions are varied and well-designed, avoiding the monotony that was 75% of the BFME I campaigns (a.k.a. destroy the enemy base, which was always located directly opposite you on the map, and maybe fulfill the ridiculously easy secondary objective).

As you can tell from the campaigns, three new factions are introduced - Goblins (roughly equivalent to the spam-happy Mordor from BFME I - units that are weak but cheap with a few random heavy hitters), Dwarves (incredibly strong and ponderously slow, very good on the defensive), and Elves (think Gondor from BFME I and soup it up, making them stronger and faster but are slightly weaker defensively as a trade off). Gondor and Rohan have been combined into the ""Men of the West"" faction, combining the best of both worlds, and Mordor has been made slightly more robust, including adding a few more heroes, but have lost the free orcs. Isengard, with the exception of adding new heroes, is pretty much identical.

My favorite addition to the game is the ""War of the Ring"" mode, which takes the campaign mode from BFME I and turns it into a Risk type of game, with territories able to be reconquered, garrisoned, built up and more. This adds a great level of strategy and fun to the game, and any battles can be auto-resolved or fought out in real-time. My only complaints about this mode are that the AI tends to be too agressive, leaving their territories undefended, and that the players only can have three armies that invade other territories (they led by pre-selected heroes you have at the beginning of the game; later heroes you build can't lead armies).

The create-a-hero feature is a cool concept, but I would have liked to see more options - each character can only have certain skills depending on their class (wizard, orc, et cetera), which is fine, but we only get 12 or so to choose from. Appearance options are even worse, with only a sparse variety - you can't even change hair color. And every hero costs 2000 resources, no matter how powerful or useless they are. (This was apparently fixed in the now-difficult-to-find expansion pack, ""Rise of the Witch King"")

Also, a lot of the little annoying things from BFME I have been fixed. Unit-producing buildings now can be upgraded by purchasing an upgrade, cutting out the rank-based-on-production system that never worked because the command point limit was so low - another issue that has been resolved in BFME II, with a base CP limit of 1000 that is adjustable (it also is realistic - player start a game with 100 CPs and, as they build up their infrastructure, get more). Resource gathering is now based on territory and buildings can be built anywhere, which makes the game more realistic - factions now battle it out for the entire map instead of trying to control one of several arbitrarily-chosen ""expansion points."" There is also a new difficulty for the AI - ""Brutal"" - for those of us who found the ""Hard"" opponents somewhat lacking.

All in all, this is a very worthwhile game that is both deeper than BFME I (thereby pleasing the BFME and other RTS veterans) while still being fairly easy to pick up (meaning the rookies will enjoy it). It's quality and fun, but has enough frustrations and shortcomings to land it squarely in 4-star territory.",A slightly more fleshed-out version of the original,1239840000,6,,

I think the difficulty just adds to the overall gloominess of the game.  All is hopeless.  You're stuck.  How could a game about a dolphin be so depressing you ask?

His family and friends are gone, the music has changed to some dreadful depressing music that is nothing less than a deep brooding despair.  You'll wander around the sea looking for your fellow dolphins and the pressing the button on your controller sends out a sound wave that in itself sounds like a eerie cry for help which always goes unanswered.

It's not long after this, that the actual game starts.  The music shifts again to a dark gloomy, but intense melody that perfectly sets the mood.

The game had a problem recognizing my Thrustmaster 5-in-1 wheel thinking it was a Thrustmaster Challenge wheel that has different settings for operations such as braking and acceleration.  I clicked on file properties and went to the game file's location.  There I found another file for the English manual. On page 20, or so, it explains how to create a wheel profile for an unrecognized wheel.  All I had to do was go back to the game, choose the controls section, and then create a new profile as instructed.  Different operation boxes were shown, and I then steered the wheel, stepped on a pedal, or pressed a button to create the profile.

I am now up and running on the realistic (for beginners) Extreme Arcade section of the game. The car on the screen responds well to my wheel even though the wheel is a less expensive model.  I like that the game's graphics resemble a race track and countryside without artificial additions and craziness.

Another plus,  is the modifications that can be made to the game such as downloading Formula 1 cars from [...].  I purchased a membership for a small fee, so that the download took minutes rather than hours.  I also had to download an unzip file that I found for free on the Internet.  The instruction in the readme.txt file explains where to place the other downloaded files.  They are put in the Steam file loaded on the hard drive.  The instructions say that the downloaded files are going into Race 07, but the files are actually placed in both the Race 07 and the GTR Evolution games.  When I purchased GTR Evolution, I also also got Race 07. The games seem identical except for the intro music.  The 2005 Formula 1 cars that I downloaded have the catchy shrieking sound.  I access the Formula 1 cars by clicking on BMW formula.  I then have the option of both types of formula cars.  The Formula 1 cars' fragility and tendency to spin-out make the game all the more fun.

This gen 3 model has slight cosmetic differences from gen 1 and gen 2 but overall feels pretty familiar. Felt identical to my others with one very nice but note able difference and that is the overall weight: Astro put these on a serious diet as they now feel as light as the A40s. This equates to a headset that is even more comfortable for extended periods of time which I didn't think was possible. Sound wise I notice that this new model sounds crisper in the mid and highs than the previous models. Mic quality out of the box is about the same but can be improved through the Astro Command Center.  Battery life is much better as I am getting about 15hrs out of the new model where 8 was about the best with the two previous models.

I ate and stuff, but most of the time I played this. I invited 3 friends over and we agreed that we hadden't had so much fun playing a game multiplayer since Halo. Most of the time all we did was play Armeggedon Hell in a Cell. (Kind of like a fatal four way, except with six people. I'm not talking about elimination chamber.) It has all the match types that deserve to be in a game. The only one I can think of that isn't in this game is the coffin match, which was stupid anyway. When you do matches in season mode you get smackdown! dollars you can use to buy stuff. You can buy Legends, (Jimmy Superfly Snuka, Ted Dibiase, Sgt. Slaughter, Old School Undertaker, Road Warriors, (rest in piece, Hawk) and others.) You can buy arenas (Wrestlemania XIX, pay per view arenas, times square.) You can buy move sets, diva loading screens, extra costumes for certain wrestlers, and the ability to change the bra and panties color for certain divas. Now, onto the two new matches. The elimination chamber, and the bra and pamties match. Elimination chamber is one of the funnest matches in the game. It is like a hell in a cell, Except ther are four chambers behind the turnbuckles. With a wrestler waiting in each chamber. Two wrestlers start out battling in the ring, and after a few minutes, a wrestler is released from one of the chambers. When you pin or make somebody tap out, they are eliminated. All six superstars can be in the ring at the same time, making a really insane crazy match. Bra and panties is stupid, I think. You objective is to tear your opponents clothes off until they are left in their bra and panties. Not very fun. In the season mode you start right after wrestlemania and work your way towards next years wrestlemania. But you can only go one year. But if you save it, you can go through season mode again with that character and carry over everything you did the last season. So say you are HHH, and you win the World heavyweight championship. And you still have it after wrestlemania, than if you track everything, it will be on the next season that you do. You can also upgrade your stats as you go along. Each wrestlers has 5 different stats that you can upgrade. Strengh, speed, technique, submission, and stamina. You get experiance for every match you do in season. Get enough and you can upgrade one of your superstars stats. They also have weight detection. For instance, Rey Mysterio won't be able to pick up big show at first, but if you get his strengh stat up, eventually he will be able to. Overall, this is one of my most favorite games of all time.",One of greatest game ever created,1090627200,,,

Graphically this game is nice to look at.

Gameplay: 9/10
The gameplay hasn't changed. If you played Fall of Cybertron, this is pretty much the same. This is something that I enjoyed though.

Story: 5/10
The story feel rushed so that they could have a game come out with the movie ""Age of Extinction"".
I was able to complete the story in about 4 hours on normal difficulty, so it is a short game.

overall: 7/10
this game is good for a weekend affair, but definitely not worth spending more than $20. You are better off buying/replaying Fall of Cybertron. This game was rushed, and although graphically it is nice and the gameplay is smooth, the story leaves a lot to be desired.

The side buttons are easy to use and once you get used to the size of the mouse, they become just another part of your routine. Technically, this thing has 18 buttons:

We will start with the obvious 12 buttons on the side that you hit with your thumb. These buttons are handy for hotkeys in games and other programs. They don't replace the horizontal number buttons across the top of your keyboard but work in conjunction with them; making certain tasks much easier. I found out completely by accident the other day that the side numbers on the mouse work while watching youtube as well. press any button and you can jump around in the video. For instance - If you open a video and press 5, it will jump the cue mark ahead in the video. If you press 1 again, it will move that cue back to the beginning of the video.

Beyond those 12, we have the left and right click buttons along with the wheel in the center. Directly behind the wheel there are 2 little buttons that adjust the mouse's sensitivity allowing you the user to customize the way you interact with your computer. The last button, number 18 is directly to the left of the left mouse button. It is a tiny little button and can highlight an entire page of text without moving your mouse. Very nice feature to have handy.

UPDATE: Tomorrow (Dec. 3, 2016) will be 2 years since I ordered this mouse. I use it everyday. It is an absolute delight to use. I would give this thing 10 stars if I could. It is extremely comfortable in my hand. It works flawlessly on almost any surface I put it on (there are exceptions). After 2 years the lights are still as bright and vibrant as they were the day I plugged it in. I expected some wear and tear over time as I am an avid gamer and use this mouse in countless programs. Every button still works like the day it arrived. the DPI sensor still works like a charm.

For Honor then tries to blend the complex combat style of Bloodborne with the epic battle scale of Battlefield and what we get is a hot mess of rock, paper, scissors combat descending into who gangs up on who contest.  Combine gameplay that nearly makes the game annoying with the fact that the game is DRM and is always required to be online and you get a game that is not worth it for any casual gamer.

Now, that's not to say For Honor doesn't have a single-player campaign to try and stand up on it's own.  The single player campaign consists of a three-part mini-series following several characters from each faction revolving around a revolution led by a character that admired Bri of Tarth from Game of Thrones way too much and adopted the same callsign as the Angel of Death in the Greek translation of the Bible.  This would make for an interesting story except we don't get to be with the characters long enough to care and you never see their faces so, for all we know, they're Jango Fett clones and this is some weird battle scenario in the Star Wars world of Camino.

I only got mostly into the viking campaign before I got bored of carrying the entire army that couldn't march in a straight line if you paid them in mead.  Like the Ramirez meme in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, you feel a sense of doing everything while your people sit back, pull up the lawn furniture, and watch.  Even Ryse: Son of Rome, a game that came out years earlier, had AI teammates that helped out on occasion.

After single player I attempted the multiplayer campaign and, unless you communicate well with your team to stick together, you're gonna get ganged up on real fast, cheap swept off a tall ledge and insta-killed.  I'm not a fan of multiplayer anyway so the was the final straw that made me turn the game off and put Ghost Recon: Wildlands back in.

In MOO2, the strategy to win is pretty much the same every game. Build up tech, build up fleets, run the enemy off the map. There are new diplomacy options, tech options, and ship building features, but these details, I thought, quickly burned themselves out. The later portion of the game becomes an almost endless cycle of starting new buildings and ships as you have more and more planets contributing to production, and that is a serious drawback to all of the Civ type games. You can spend a considerable amount of time doing nothing but acknowledging ""production complete"" messages at the start of each game turn.

Still, the game overall was fun, and by the time computers didn't have floppy drives to load the original MOO anymore, I was more or less stuck with MOO2 for my sci-fi fix.

""The 3rd Birthday,"" on the other hand, could have been a fantastic follow-up.

I was one of the lucky ones who got a PS4 a few days earlier because of the Taco Bell promo, so I've had a few days prior to launch to mess around with it. I was able to get a copy of COD Ghosts, so please take that into account when I discuss the PS4 graphical capabilities. Also, I could not play online yet so I won't be talking about online gaming in this review.

The PS4 is Sony's 4th generation console, and they've been successful in every generation since their first. I think you're going to see history repeat itself with the PS4 launch...... off to a slow start, but by the end of the generation it will be on top. With a fairly weak lineup, there was honestly not much I was excited about, besides the fact that it's Sony's new console in 7 years. Hooking up the device is a breeze, you just plug the power cable (no power brick required!) into the PS4 and into the wall, and the HDMI (included) from the PS4 to your TV or receiver, and you're set to go. First thing I did was pop in COD Ghosts, installed it onto the HDD, and started playing the campaign mode. I have this game for the 360, and comparing the graphics to the PS4, it was only marginally better. The game looks very pretty, don't get me wrong, but it just isn't that big of a jump in graphical power from last generation to this generation (nothing like how when the Sega Dreamcast first came out and blew everything out of the water). Now for the game play itself...... there was some lag during some of the more intense parts of the game. The 360 version definitely handles COD better than the PS4, which makes sense because the PS4 is a brand new system, but then again, it is using an x86 architecture which is theoretically ""easier to program"" for, but I guess they had some trouble porting COD Ghosts.

Now let's talk about media capabilities, or lack thereof. Blu-Ray movies play fine, just as you would expect from Sony, however...you cannot play 3D movies! Sony will probably enable this feature later, but for now you can't do it. The PS4 is a 4K capable device, but only for movies and photos, not video games. One of my biggest gripes about the PS4 is that it can't play audio CDs and mp3s, or stream media from your computer....WTF Sony? The PS3 was a great media center, and I hoped the PS4 would be too, but these lack of basic music features is going to make me knock one star off of my rating. I've heard rumors that Sony will enable this feature later, but we will have to wait and see. I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled a 180 like Microsoft did earlier this year.

Pros:
-sleek product ID (smaller than the ps3 slim!)
-quiet design
-500 GB Hard Drive
-Ability to upgrade your HDD to a larger HDD (or SSD)
-controller is a Dualshock 3 on steroids (it's better in everyday)
-built in power supply (no brick!!!)
-USB 3.0 ports
-iPhone and Android app

Cons
-No Audio CD playback
-No MP3 playback
-No DLNA support
-No media streaming from a computer (no mp3s, no movies...)

If you downloaded the 2k17 Prelude, you know you're in for some greatness and 2k17 hasn't disappointed me aside from a few hiccups. 17, while not perfect, is probably the best playing 2K I've ever experienced. Read on.

The Prelude was available for you to play before 2k17 was launched. It basically teased you to buy the game and it did work! LOL. The game let's you start your ""My Career"" mode and prepare yourself to make it to the NBA. It really got me interested in the game more. While the gameplay was limited for what I played, I was really wanting to get the full game and finish my career after I finished the prelude.

NBA 2K17 has the usual offerings as you expect. The Prelude got me super interested in the career mode, and that's saying a lot, I usually just stick with GM mode and work with my team, not a single guy. But this mode is going to be a blast trying to get my player into the NBA.

On the court NBA 2k17 is superb. I'd say the controls and gameplay feel a lot better than 2k16. Shooting jumpers and the mechanics was a complaint for 2k16 by many and it looks like they ironed that out in 2k17. I love the new shooting meter (if you want it on) IF you have an open shot, and if you're a shooter, you'll swish these shots in no time! Rebounding, the touch passes look amazing and the fancy passes, while sweet in 16, look even more incredible than ever.  17 just feels more organic and you feel like you're more in control. There's some sweet new post moves also ,but they can't be explained by vocabulary, you'll just have to see them for yourself and you will. Dunking, the emotion, it's all here and yes, this feels like a real NBA game. Defensively is my only main complaint in this game. The aggressive D doesn't seem to be as helpful as I was hoping. I have guys running around me left and right. Thankfully, the Help D seems more in sync than last year. And that point of emphasis really seems to finally be working. I'd recommend if you have trouble guarding a guy at the point, I'd say control a guy in the paint and rely on your inside D. I still have guys leaving their man when I made no attempt or pressed for a double team, this was a bit of a problem on 16, and it seems to still happen on 17, but it's hit and miss.

The graphics are great overall. I'd say the courts look better than last year, not breathtaking, but very good. They promised real authentic lighting, although I heard some venues are inaccurate like LA and NY are not authentic for what we see now.  Speaking of the Knicks, the baby blue colors is still way off from the real court. Does MGS have a lock on what a game can show maybe? I wonder if it's just off for that reason? The knicks is NOT baby blue! I'll research that later.

In contrast of past games,  I still think 2k14 had the best looking courts and players, but 2k17 is no slouch. If this game took any cutback in the visuals, the player models skin looks like clay at times and some of the players might be too skinny. It's very subtle, and most won't really notice unless you're really giving them a good inspection, but if you compare to like NBA 2k14, you will notice the skin and proportions just looks slightly off. But what they did focus on, was the smooth animations and the player physique and proportions and the face scans are A grade with a few exceptions. When I checked out some of the faces, I was floored. I look at say a 98 Rodman of the Bulls. Wow, just google around for that one. You talk virtual reality, some of these faces will blow you away. The current guys probably look just as good. Durant's body finally looks like Durant's body, perhaps a bit too skinny and guys like Green on Warriors is distinguishable If your favorite player has a long wing span and long lanky arms, you're going to notice him next to a 250 pound Power forward.

The Legends are still there but I am disappointed for Kobe as isn't this the coverboy?  While he may be on the game and looks fantastic on the 98 lakers and the 01 Lakers, and on the cover and what not, I would have love to see some more Laker love. More teams would have been nice. But I don't see anything. Maybe they're planning some future DLC?  And in general, I didn't notice any new teams for the Legends lineup unfortunately. Still got the classic Bulls, Lakers, Spurs, Celtics, etc. I'll take those for now. But please, how bout bringing back the 2002 kings and 96 Pacers for next year please? :)  What I did see is that you can download (I think 12 college teams of the past with their all time players ) Teams like Georgetown, Kansas, Michigan State, etc. It's pretty cool you can download these additional teams, but it's a bit odd having them play NBA teams. These are college kids. lol. I wish we had a mini season we can do with these teams. Maybe we implement them into a customized franchise. I know you can use the past NBA teams in an NBA season, so maybe you can do that. Again, it's a bit weird. FYI, it's 14.99 to download all the NCAA teams available.

The last few years, fans have really been complaining on the look of the Legends and just being off, usually the complaints are because of their faces and hair looking ""not like their actual counterparts"". I thought they looked just okay in NBA 16. You'll have that great looking Legend, then find a Legend that looks downright bad. Jordan has been off for years. When they made the transition to next gen, something happened. Jordan looks a little better this year and some guys like Rodman, Ewing, Pippen, Bird, look absolutely fantastic this year and looks like virtual reality for some. And thankfully Steve Kerr no longer looks like a Ken Doll. The fans look a little bit more animated, but, eh. Still look like zombies when you see them up close. They show a little more animation and a bit more lively. But up close when you see them, they really don't look that much different from 2k16 or even 15 for that matter.

Out of the box, you get the Dream Team. Wahoo! Barkley finally signed. It's too bad we don't have a team like the 76ers or the Suns when Barkley was with them, but having the Dreamteam back again is amazing. Arguably the best basketball team ever made!!!

2K advertised authentic arena sounds and chants. In a nutshell, I'd say, yes, it's better than 2k17. But do NOT expect anything mind-blowingly awesome. They still use that generic PA announcer. You'll recognize him. He's been in the game since 2k9! I don't mind him, but man, wouldn't it be nice to have an authentic PA announcer for each venue? The crowd noise is better, not great, just better. Seems to be a little more interaction and emotion with things going on with the action. More cheers and more boos. It does add to the immersion. I need to play at some more venues around the league to determine if the chants and stadium sounds are truly authentic.

The game boasts 10 different commentators. I've only heard one different one in my play time so far, I think I ran into the usual, Kevin Harlan and I think the other guy was Brent Barry. Depending on where you play, you'll get a different guy along side with Harlan. It's pretty cool. Not sure how deep the commentary is, but we shall see. The halftime show is still Shaq, Kenny and Ernie. Ehhh. You'd think with Barkley being on the Dreamteam they could get him to be in the halftime. Nope. Darn it.

Update: After a few days I can talk a little more about My Career. It's awesome. You take your college phenom into the NBA and try to turn him into an NBA great. You get drafted to a random team and it takes you through an interesting story and the set pieces they put you in a great fantasy world of trying to make it as a pro in the NBA. The story I'd expect to be cheese all the way, but I was genuinely interested on what each day would bring. Coaches will send you texts and let you know how you're doing and give you some guidance and even a little love!  The first day I got drafted, I met with one of my rookie teammates and we played a game of 2k in the apartment. You can play pickup games with your team mates at the practice stadium or at your what I would call a ""crib"". You get a text messages from friends, coaches and even your mom. The texting thing is more fun to use than I thought and it keeps the game fresh. Leveling up to get your attributes seems to take a bit longer than it should however. And the pickup games with my friends/teammates doesnt' seem to give me any points/coins to gain. Maybe I'll get rewards later? Either way, it's a long process getting your guy solid. AS a standout draft pick, You' think your player would be higher than 55-57 overall. To me, we should be at least a 70. But ya know, the fun is leveling up. You get your most points playing real games. The game is different experience controlling one guy on the court. Sometimes I feel my team mates need to get me more involved. But overall, the AI is pretty good about getting me the ball. The mode will keep you busy all year.

I had a few glitches of blue screens obliterating the screen where I couldn't see the action until the moment of tip off. Glitchy! Happened a few times. No major glitches though where I had to reset. I've become accustomed to glitches for these games. I think they're rushed a bit. But usually the most obvious are taken care of. I hope.

NBA 2K17 continues to be the best sports franchise on the planet and 17 on the court is real basketball at its finest. Better than FIFA, better then Madden, better than NHL and of course better than NBA Live. There's a lot of love put into these games and while I'm sure we'll have those initial launch bugs of ""hey what's this bug about?"" It's just something we have to deal with. But hopefully with time, this game will keep you quite busy until 2k18.

Microsoft landed on a well-sized controller with the Xbox 360 as the original Xbox had a very large controller (The Duke) as well as the S model, which was much smaller.  The Xbox One controller takes the 360 controller and refines the formula even more.  Recently, they updated that formula AGAIN, adding a 3.5mm headphone jack so you wouldn't need to use proprietary headsets or adapters any longer.  The press material states that the D-Pad and sticks have been redesigned, but they seem the same as the previous Xbox One controllers, so maybe they mean they were redesigned over the 360 controllers?  Am I missing something?

The included wireless dongle comes with Windows 10 drivers preinstalled, but it can be used with many versions of Windows.  Initially, you needed a separate USB cable to use the controller with Windows, and had to leave it plugged in, but the dongle allows for wireless play.

My only big complaint here is that the home button, or guide button, is VERY bright.  I haven't seen settings to change the brightness, but Microsoft has occasionally updated the firmware on the actual controllers.

Announced today, on the Xbox One, you can remap any of the buttons, similar to the Xbox Elite controller.  A nice feature for many gamers, and nice that they are continuing to improve this already great controller.","Great controller, made even more flexible",1447632000,,,

The protagonist is Father Arno Moriani, a priest sent by the Vatican to investigate a local Transylvanian doctor who is slated for sainthood. But his seemingly simple investigation into the good doctor takes several unpredictable twists, and he soon finds himself plunged headfirst into a world of shadowy vampires, a battle that threatens not only his faith but also his life.

The main failing of the game is the *absence* of vampires; you only deal directly with the title character at the very end of a long and tiring journey. The rest of the time, you're researching obscure texts, closely examining artwork, and leafing through hefty tomes of Romanian history that deal with the origins of Dracula, or Vlad Tepes. There are also undercurrents of WWII even though the game is set in 1920 (yep, evil Nazis and bad German accents!). There are only a handful of characters, but the ones you do interact with are generally fleshed out, with unique personalities and solid voicework.

The puzzles themselves are some of the better ones I've seen in the last few years; there's a wide variety of strategy board games, locks, word puzzles, and inventory-based puzzles. Phlebotomy takes up a large part of the game; if you're squeamish, you probably won't go for the graphic how-to on drawing your own blood several times (""now all that's left is to push the needle deep into the vein!""), or poring over cells under a microscope.  Generally, the solutions are quite obvious, although one of the end puzzles requires careful observation and piecing together clues collected throughout the game. One of the features which could have been better utilized was the Bible passages; whenever your character is stressed out (you'll hear his heart beating loudly), you can flip open the Bible to an underlined passage that is directly related to the situation at hand. This action isn't necessary, however, and could have been made a more central element directly related to protecting Father Arno's faith (and sanity).

The graphics are lushly drawn, bringing to life the war-torn village with its bombed-out  buildings. Ghostly howls ricochet down the empty streets. The lushness of Budapest is a direct contrast to war-ravaged Romania, and you visit rural Turkey as well. Character animations are effective, and the cutscenes are downright gorgeous, with a hazy, dreamlike quality (you're able to replay videos through the gallery feature on the main menu). The only disappointment was the ending; after so many hours of research and daring escapes, the final confrontation was brief and disappointing. The end cinematics were great, though, and leave openings for future installments.  Overall, this is a solidly crafted adventure with loads of atmosphere and political intrigue, but sadly, little of the title character.","Lots of atmosphere, but low on vampires",1226016000,5,,

It also shares much of the mechanics and gameplay tropes of the earlier game, and thats all to the good as well. It differs from Hard Reset in some areas, however, most notably with the variety of weapons and the more conventional upgrade system and skills tree. Theres also a stronger story, although it is a tad incoherent at times. There are some very cool cutscenes, but they're used sparsely and never intrude but do help to flesh out the story. And theres also plenty of amusing, deliberately cheesy, dialogue to enjoy. Graphically, SW is one of the most stunning games Ive come across, and it also delivers some impressive physics.

3D Effect- C-
I played the game 95% of the time with it off. While it looked good most of the time there was way too much ghosting on certain images. They really needed to spend the time to get this part of it right with it being a launch game. I feel like this was a missed opportunity as this game was a perfect candidate to showcase the 3D capabilities of the 3DS. Compared to Pilotwings Resort this is a big fail.

Controls- B-
The camera, when locked in the normal position, focused too much on the ground. I always felt like I wanted to lift my head up the whole time. I was never really able to get used to it. I found myself wanting to go into 1st person view a lot to compensate which is not really necessary but becuase of the camera it made it feel like a need. Other than that the other controls worked perfectly.

Sound- D
The sound was the biggest problem with this game. It sounded like crackling through the speakers a lot. Like they were going to blow. And, keep in mind, the volume was never very loud. This was definately a programing problem.

Graphics- B+
The game is quite gorgeous to look at. It has aged well and is ported in a respectful manner here. Even to todays standards this game looks very nice indeed.

Fun- B+
I really enjoyed this game back in the day and it is just as fun now. Like I mentioned already, this game does not seem like it has aged at all.

Overall, I really enjoyed this game. It is a very fun game. Apart from the camera and sound the game is of high standards even in terms of current day games.

""Lake House: Children of Silence"" is a nicely done hidden object/adventure game.

The storyline is a great one and held my interest throughout.  The game is a nice mixture of puzzles and hidden object games.  The puzzles were challenging but not too difficult.  The hidden object games are nicely done - sometimes you have to move something or put something together to find the object.  There is a map - not the best map I've seen in games like this but it is very handy in letting you know which locations you can work on.  The music is a nice background for the game.

Both took a franchise that was very popular and turned it into a real-time strategy that was very simplistic but surprisingly fun, thus making it a gateway game for people who had never tried a strategy game before.

Like BFME, Halo Wars offers the bare minimum of customization: bases are in fixed locations on the map, there are three basic types of units, and only one kind of resource. Without all the fixin's that us RTS vets are used to, though, this game is very intuitive, and even players who have never touched a strategy game in their life will have the hang of it within the first few missions of the campaign (which is excellent, by the way, but only playable on the UNSC side - you only play the Covenant in skirmish mode). The graphics in the game are also superb, comparable to BFME II played on the good graphics settings.

The game has the standard 1000G available from Achievements, but spreads them out a lot. Each mission has a 5G Achievement attached to it. Sort of making up for that, you get five Achievements worth 250G (and a pair of gamer pictures) just from beating the campaign on any difficulty, two of them worth a whopping 70G apiece. Another 80G (and maybe more gamer pictures - haven't tried to get them yet) await those who beat the game on Hard (30G) and Legendary (50G) as well.

A few things about the game did tick me off. Grouping units is nonexistent, and specialized selection is nearly absent - you can select individual units, a series of individual units, all units of one type, all in a general area, all on-screen, or all overall. This made planning multi-front assaults hard to execute (the ""all in a general area"" selection option did not always grab every unit in an area, and sometimes grabbed a separate unit that was near a clustered group that it could probably have been on-screen if the screen was aligned just so). There is a nice ""Automatic"" difficulty option in Skirmish mode, but it gets very hard very quickly (I went from a breezy 40 to a decent 60 to a hair-pulling 97 in three matches). Finally, when you play as the Covenant (or against them), you really have to look at your buildings to tell them apart. I still click on the building to see what it is. Thankfully, all the UNSC buildings look different enough that you can see what they are at a glance.

The trio its in (Gold, Silver, and Crystal) are often thought to be the best Pokemon games, pre-HGSS at least. I can't agree on that, but they're still fantastic.

You can only play as Ethan. So if you're used to the gender option, too bad. That wasn't implemented until Crystal, the next game.

There isn't much of a difference between Gold and Silver. It mainly depends on what Pokemon you want, and whether you want Lugia or Ho-Oh on your cart and title screen.

Gold's exclusive Pokemon are: Mankey, Primeape, Growlithe, Arcanine, Spinarak, Ariados, Gligar, Mantine.
Silver's are: Vulpix, Ninetales, Meowth, Persian, Ledyba, Ledian, Delibird, Skarmory

Pros:
When gaming I found that it tracked and targeted well.
Right and left buttons are easy to press.
Scroll wheel feels sturdy and it scrolls smoothly.
It is a nice size--not too large and clunky, but not uncomfortably small--and it also has a smooth finish which is pleasant.
It is lightweight, but still well balanced.
Three DPI levels for those that find that important.
Installed to my computer without software.

Cons:
No extra buttons.
Shorter cable than I need, but that is a common problem. I have only encountered a few with a long enough cable.
I can't help but feel that $40 is a bit pricey for such a simple, no frills mouse.

I received a free mouse for review and it did not contain the software, so if there are any special, customizable features I can not review them.

I also have yet to drop it (give me a few more hours), so I can't contest to it's sturdiness.  I will update this review if I find that a problem.

Overall, if looking to invest around $40 for a two-button gaming mouse, I would recommend this one.

Edit: I have to change my opinion on this mouse.  I have used it (a lot) for the past six days.  I have also dropped it a few times.  The cursor is now jerky at times, jittering all around what I am trying to click on.  This doesn't happen constantly, but it is does happen in both gaming and when surfing. I now have occasional difficulty with it tracking and targeting correctly.  Had I purchased it, instead of receiving it as part of the Vine program, I would be taking it back to the store tomorrow morning.

Well, add improved graphics, weapons upgrades, and more control over the placement of town parts, and that's what you got. I will give the game its certain due, though.

The repetative dungeon crawl does become addictive as you attempt to gather gems, stones, and experience to convert your weapons, though I actually dozed off in 'Shipwreck', and when I shook myself awake I had completed another couple of levels...

Whilst one review didn't like the cotton mat, it is quite good quality and better than using another mterial such as paper (as some of these card games do). The graphics are very impressive and the animations are smooth. You can turn the animations of if you so wish.

You don't even need a controller for this game (expect for the menus) and the main game can be played with just cards - which is really cool and convient. The 'action cards' need to be held up to the eye which is a knack as you must get it the right distance from the eye and whithout obsuring the face of the card.

I personally don't mind the metal soundtrack it seems to suit the game (but when defeat is near - I hate it!). When the game starts to get a bit crowded (with lots of cards on the mat) there is often a problem with one card not being read properly - you fix that and in doing so, you ruin another card etc. Shadows are the main cause of this (so buy/get a desktop lamp or something!).

The game allows you focus on the great stratgry element - but the tutrials are more cofusing than they are helpful. Play with a friend the first few times and learn from each others mistakes - before challanging a computer or going online. The cards themselves are good quality and with currently over 110 crds to collect (with more on there way) the game always give you soemthing new.

The people are much nicer to talk to in Seasons, and that makes it easier, knowing that going up to someone in the game, you will probably get a kind response. Not so in Ages, as some (maybe even most) of the people are surly in response, which I did not find very appealing.
One of the most blatant benefits of the game is that there are four different variations to each tile, Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter, whereas there is only Past and Present in Ages.

Players of that series will find familiar controls and story-telling techniques. Red Dead Redemption however takes place in the wild west.

5.0,True,"02 18, 2012",A35JJ25SN77BSC,B005IMVP0O,David Manning,"Holding the unit my fingers tend to rest on the rear touch panel. This hasn't really been an issue too much, but in games like little deviants where you are using the back panel to push up from underneath your other hand can accidentally be pushing the touch pad in the wrong spot. There are two little divots that seem to be where your fingers are supposed to go, but I have fairly large hands and it is not comfortable keeping my fingers there. The system itself is pretty light, but feels solid in your hands. The front and back both have glass so getting two screen protectors might be prudent and a hard case for travel wouldn't be unwise.

The sound is much better then you could get out of the PSP and the speaker placement has never been an issue, even with my large hands. I could still clearly hear dialog in games in noisy environments and people were even commenting on how good the Vita sounded.

The screen is a thing of beauty. It is 5' and the colors and brightness are amazing, with one small exception. You don't want to play your system in a completely dark room if you can help it. This might sound weird, but the screen has these dark ""spots"" that show up when the system is displaying a black screen in a completely dark room. If you turn on a light it is impossible to find these spots and the screen is amazing again. The manual says this is normal and not a malfunction of the Vita system, and I've heard from users of OLED phones that they've seen similar on their screens in perfectly dark rooms with a perfectly black image on the screen. Even when you see it, it's not horrible, and during 99% of game play you can't even notice this effect.

The touch screen function of the screen seems to be less sensitive than an iphone or android phone, but it works for the games and demos I've played on the system. The only time you really notice the lack of precision is when using the web browser and trying to touch a small link (you'll need to zoom in most of the time). Using it to throw grenades in Uncharted adds a precision that really adds to the game, so I hope other games come up with other control adaptations for the touch screen that add instead of take away from the experience.

Moving on to the web browser...well maybe we don't want to talk about that so much. Imagine the PSP browser with touch controls. Are you done retching yet? Sorry to say this is pretty much what you get. Some websites show a mobile version, others don't unless you specifically type the mobile address into the browser. Flash is not supported (Sony asked Adobe to support flash on the Vita but I don't know if they'll do it after announcing they don't want to support mobile flash anymore), so websites that use it don't work. Trying to access YouTube videos results in an error that you need to install flash in the browser. Some websites are just broken in areas (Facebook for example was constantly messing up on the Vita's browser). It is weird that Facebook has so much trouble working with the browser, but you can setup the system to automatically post to Facebook with your trophy accomplishments.

There are two cameras on the Vita. They are not the type of cameras you'll want to use for taking every day pictures. They are only .3 megapixel (same as the 3DS, however the 3DS cameras seems to take ever so slightly clearer pictures) which compared to even a basic phone is pretty awful. I don't think anyone planned to use the systems cameras for very much, so this shouldn't be too big of a deal breaker.

Games are put in by opening a flap on the top of the system. I've read some sites saying you might need a screwdriver to open this, and that is just wrong unless you don't have any fingernails. I have no trouble at all opening and closing the flap to put in and take out games.

One great feature of the system is the ability to take screenshots while playing. Simply hold start and push the PS button and the screenshot gets saved to your memory card. I wish more systems had this feature, I've been using it a lot more than I thought I would.

The start, select, and PS buttons are flush with the system which makes it really hard to accidentally press them which is great. The buttons are smaller than they are on the PSP, but they have a click to them which is much more satisfying than using the PSP buttons. The d-pad feels spot on, and fighting games should have no problem with it. The two analog sticks are okay, but they could be better. They can't be pushed to be used as L3 or R3 like on PS3, and they have a pretty limited range of motion. They get the job done, and I rate them higher than the circle pad on 3DS, but they are not as great as the stick you'd get on a 360 or PS3 controller.

Charging the system is done through an included proprietary USB cable. It's sad that Sony took a step back from the PSP when it comes to the USB connection, being able to use the same cable to connect my dual shock 3 and PSP was great. Now if your Vita cable breaks you'll be looking for a Vita specific cable. It can be hooked up to a PC to charge while powered off (very slow) or there is a power cable that the USB can be connected to which charges it at a much faster rate (and it can charges while powered on).

The memory for the Vita is also proprietary (and expensive, thanks Sony) and Sony added a layer of protection which makes using them a much bigger pain then memory was on the PSP. Your memory card is now attached to your PSN ID, and so is your Vita. In order to download something from another PSN ID (such as a JP or HK PSN account) you'll need to format your system, set up the system from start with the new PSN ID, then install a memory card attached to that PSN ID or reformat the memory card. To put it plainly it is a pain in the butt.

Speaking of pain in the butt, transferring files to and from the vita is not as easy as the PSP, and this feature also took a step backwards. You now have to access the media manager on the Vita and use it to transfer files to and from the system. Gone are the days of telling your PS3 to install something to the USB attached system or dragging and dropping files from your PC. You still cannot arrange your files on the Vita (like the PSP) without changing their name because the system automatically sorts by alphabetical order and that seems to be it.

The replacement for the XMB is a multitasking touch screen interface on the vita, and it is an improvement overall. Everything is separated into little bubbles and touching one launches the content. You can swipe to the sides to swap between tasks running in the background (when not in a game) and the whole thing is very fluid and easy to learn very quickly.

The system also comes with some little mini games (you can get trophies in them!) which are fun for about a minute each after you first get the system, then you'll never touch them again. They are part of the Welcome Park application, and they are designed to show off that the system has a touch screen, cameras, etc...

My final verdict on the system is colored by the games I've played and hope to play in the future. The system does have its issues (several of which could be fixed with future patches or firmware updates), but when you boot up Uncharted and see it running so beautifully on a portable, it makes you tend to forget there are any downsides to the system at all.

Overall Score: 8/10

Pros: screen size, two analog sticks, graphically very impressive, great sound, lot of control options, multitasking, good d-pad

Cons: awful browser, poor camera quality, proprietary memory/cables, need to format system to switch PSN IDs",Great portable system!,1329523200,5,,

Lavos first appears as a porcupine-like creature. His eerie scream is as good as Kefka's laugh, too. After defeating the Lavos shell, you go inside and fight the machine part of Lavos. Looks okay, but not great. You beat that, then fight the last version of Lavos--the vegetable-looking version. He doesn't look evil, nor does he look good. So it's awful hard to hate him. The background effect is okay, but sorta annoying, and the music at that point is bland. But that's the only problem that I have with the game--the final ending boss. Everything preceding that is top-notch Squaresoft. The storyline is really great on this game. My favorite parts are: Chrono's Trial (as good as the opera scene in FF6), the Future (especially the bike race against that Prince-like guy), the Battle against Magus in his castle is especially awesome because the music fits in so PERFECTLY with the battle. The little movie scene showing Lavos falling to earth is also a joy to see. There are ten endings to this game and many sidequests. Tough luck finding a good copy of it now, but you can get it on emulator, which is almost as good.",ALMOST PERFECT,992044800,,,

I bought it used last week from Amazon which was 1/3 of the original price and I'm glad to report that I just finished playing the game on PS3 10 minutes ago - this is probably one of the most underrated games of 2010. I like Mech games and this one really hits the spot, I could not put the controller down. The story is very engaging and decently conceived but this game is definitely not without flaws. I appreciate that the creators wanted to mix it up a little bit between Wanzer action and foot combat but the latter was pretty bad. I dread the time when I had to get out of my Wanzer and go on foot but it actually helped fill in the storyline. Sometimes during Wanzer action in the jungle, the leaves and trees get in the way of your view.
The good thing is that there were not a lot of foot missions. It is a fun game but you also have to think - the success of your mission lies behind how you customize your Wanzer and boy have I really spent a lot of time going back to the drawing board if a configuration does not work which is pretty good with all the statistics and numerical figures for a certain weapon/part etc. The boss battles were pretty challenging especially the one with Cornelius.

Overall I really like this game, I guess beauty lies on the eyes and taste of the beholder. If you are not a Mech fan then this game will just be so-so but hardcore Mech fans like me, it's a blast. Voice acting was decent as well, graphics were very good during Wanzer action but characters have facial wonkiness at times. The design of the Wanzers were also pretty well conceived.

- Lots of fun little side things to do. (Marry people and have sex, steal stuff, kill people secretly at night and then buy their homes  or buy their shops--allows you to own an entire town)

- Nice weapons and other random items to play with

- Combat is kinda fun too, especially if you add a lot of magic to your regular fighting too. Oh and, shooting for people's heads is fun too. (You can also kick the head afterwards.)

Cons:

- Short game. 20+ hours or so. BTW, after the credits, wait like 20min and you CAN get back to the game to finish off business.

It is definitely not as good as the previous two installments in the Ezio Trilogy (AC2, Brotherhood, and Revelations), but that still makes it an above average game. Constantinople (Istanbul) is the setting and I can't recall it being nearly as memorable as the other two. There are also some smaller locations. A certain extremely impressive locale that I won't mention in case it would spoil the game for those, but was probably the best of the series albeit a short part of the overall game. Going back to Altair was indeed refreshing as his story seemed to need much more explaining. Combat was indeed the best although I wasn't a fan of the new bomb crafting.

The game's biggest downfall is that it is short. To be honest, I was a little taken aback when the credits began to roll. Next, I won't delve too deep into the implemented tower defense initiative that was tacked on since that is universally regarded as a pitfall of the game. While the game did offer more detail into the paranormal nature of the series, I was still disappointed with the ""revelations"" as implied in the title. There wasn't too much revealed that was already known. I was let down by this. I was waiting for a huge twist and there was none. Anyone that has played one of Ubisoft's other franchises, Prince of Persia, will immediately see its influence on a certain side mission series in this game. I found it to be quite irritating to be honest. Lastly, Desmond's story continues to be boring and the implemented little game was pretty pointless.

2.0,False,"09 17, 2015",A2N29047JQXJDG,B0041RR0TW,Kevin Winslow,"I've used this gamepad for about a year now, and I don't recommend it. It gets 2 stars because yes, it does work, and yes, most games on PC recognize it as either a Playstation Controller, (for emulator programs, definitely a plus) or as an Xbox controller for near everything else. The wireless set-up is great, I loved not having any cords to mess with, and the battery life has been SUPERB. I have 40 plus games on Steam and about 10 on Origin, and as far as being recognized as a controller, it's never failed. So why wouldn't I recommend it?

The MASSIVE problem is with the trigger design, and analog sticks' button design. The trigger buttons need a ton of pressure to activate, and they don't feel truly analog. You'll spend the first few weeks just working to develop the finger strength to use them right, and another few weeks getting the sensitivity to know how hard to pull on them for it to count as halfway or all the way depressed. I have Watch_Dogs and Assassin's Creed: Black Flag for Steam, and my hand would literally cramp up from holding down the right trigger button while driving or free running in either game. I can't even imagine what would happen to Grand Theft Auto players. I'm a pretty strong guy, I workout 3 times a week with weights and I do martial arts, and for my hands to be cramping trying to keep that silly trigger down should tell you all you need to know.

 And what's worse is that in under a year of using it, the trigger buttons will start to goof up on you. How you ask? Well, they will activate when you're not pressing the button, or deactivate when you are. Since the trigger buttons are key for almost every shooter, stealth game, or driving game, this is a MAJOR problem. I can't even describe how annoying it is to be lining up a sniping shot in Metal Gear Solid: The Phantom Pain to all of the sudden zip out of the lens scope and see Snake start punching in air because the two trigger buttons won't work properly. In Dead Space 3, I'll have Issac trying to lower his gun with no luck, or he'll suddenly empty his clip into thin air meaning my likely quick death since I'm stuck with slow walking and turning and no ammo. The only solution has been to open up the battery casing, slide one of the batteries out of contact with the plate, put it back in and keep playing. Until it happens again and you have to repeat the process. I'd say in an hour's worth of playing I'll likely have to do this about every 5 minutes... if I'm being generous.

The two analog sticks work well, but now the R3 and L3 function, (when you push down on the analog stick to activate them as a button) are dying as well. The L3 button especially, (again, a button usually used to activate a sprint or vision function in shooters/stealth games) now takes several pushes before the function activates.

It's very frustrating. If not for those lousy trigger buttons and analog stick buttons, this thing is a great sell for a great price! There's other reviews out there that say the same thing about them, it's a common problem. Every other button on it works perfectly and feels really solid and responsive. It's almost a Greek tragedy that so much of this thing is so good, only to be ruined by what is so bad! I have old Playstation, Playstation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and PS3 controllers that even after years of using them work phenomenally. For this to be breaking down in under a year shows really shoddy design.

I love gaming on my PC, and this controller, (during the first 6 months) was a blast even with hand cramps because I could kick back across the room wirelessly. Now it's such a headache that I nearly want to throw it across the room every game I play. I just ordered an Xbox controller with a PC cable because I couldn't take it anymore.

If, (and this is a key *if*), you don't put much wear and tear on it, it might be worth it for the price and may last longer. However, if you don't use an Xbox or Playstation console and instead do all your gaming on PC, (like I do), then you're better off shelling out the extra bucks on a better controller.",Buyer Beware!

After logging more hours than I would care to count playing the game it was starting to feel a little monotonous and like there wasn't as much to explore.  I'm glad I bought this EP because it added richness to the game.  Installing it, each life stage feels even more distinctive and involved.  There are new create a sim features, new traits, new lifetime rewards, new party types, fieldtrips, a new daycare profession, new places to woohoo, new creatures, new rabbit holes, afterschool activities, and more.  It's quite the long list and it does feel like that when you play the game.  I really enjoyed new features that hadn't been there before, especially sending my teen sim to prom, having a bachelorette party before a wedding, and the new objects like working strollers, treehouses and more.

Another included feature in the game is the ability to send child & teen sims away to boarding school.  While they are gone you effectively can't play them, but they can still call home and you can call them.  They also learn new skills while they are gone and get traits, though they didn't learn nearly as many skills as the teen I kept at home and played normally.  It does cost money to send the to one of the boarding skills, but it is nice if you want to have a robust family tree because taking care of all those children in addition to daily responsibilities for your adult sims can be tough.  The only disappointment is that while they are away you can't keep track of where they are in their age progression or what traits they might be gaining in real time.

While I do love this game overall, I do have some slight nits.  I wish they had an option to have an ongoing nanny vs. constantly calling for a babysitter.  I also think, as I've felt with other EP's, they don't provide nearly enough objects/items.  Sims 3 has been pretty stingy with them across the board, probably in an effort to get people to buy things in the online store.  I especially wish they had offered a range of wedding dresses.  Considering how much of it is about the dress, that seemed like a miss, though I do feel like the fashions have been lacking overall in the whole Sims 3 franchise.

5.0,True,"09 15, 2014",A3L8ANRC1XYH8E,B00BGAA0SU,Leohlyon,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from Infamous Second Son because I just couldn't get excited about it. Sure, it looked great (from a graphics perspective) but I thought the gameplay reminded me of Prototype, which isn't a good thing. Well, I'm glad I didn't rely on the walkthrough footage from YouTube, because I would have missed out on a fantastic game!

Combat - Second Son hangs it's hat on being a third person shooter, and does a very good job in that department. There's no auto-aim, so you'll have to be pretty precise in order to hit your targets. I don't want to leave out melee attacks because you'll sometimes be forced to use them when an enemy chooses to get a little 'up close and personal'. Stealth combat is a welcomed addition because you'll sometimes find it a little easier to sneak up behind an enemy and kill him without causing a commotion. The only aspect of combat that I didn't like was the inability to switch hands whiles shooting. For example, if you're using a pillar as cover, it would be ideal to be able to switch shooting hands and have a cleaner shot at the bad guys. We had this functionally in the first two Infamous games.

Weaponry - Initially, you'll only have a chain as your main weapon (melee attack). But as you progress through the game, you'll acquire four more powers (smoke, neon, video, and concrete). I won't go into too much detail because they're all pretty much 'point and shoot' types of powers. My favorite of the lot was probably smoke because it was the most accessible. You'll be able to drain smoke from any car, as well as several other smoke sources around town. My least favorite was the neon power because I found it to be the least effective out of the four. Video power was the hardest to come by. Some districts had a few video sources here and there, while other districts didn't have any at all. The concrete power was probably the most enjoyable one to use, but be aware that you will not gain it until very late in the campaign.

Enemies - This is probably the weakest area of the game (although not a big deal). The enemy variety is pretty low, but it doesn't matter because the battles are so much fun! The enemies are members of the 'D.U.P.' military group, and they all look very similar. Think of it this way: The enemies in the Batman games look pretty similar but that didn't detract from the game, did it? Same can be said for Second Son. The street battles are so epic in scale that you won't give a damn about who looks like what (nor will you have time to). There aren't very many boss battles, but I thoroughly enjoyed the few that were included in the game. I won't give too much away, but there's a fight with a winged fellow that's simply LEGENDARY, and I'll leave it at that.

Miscellaneous - Don't be mislead by the reviewers who are crying about how short the game is. If you play the game how it was meant to be played; meaning partaking in ALL of the sidemissions, you'll be rewarded with a very fulfilling gaming experience. Outside of blast shards (used to level up powers) there isn't much to collect. This is a sandbox type of game, so exploration is limited to the several districts that make up the city of Seattle. Second Son is not without it's flaws. I assumed I would be able to possess all four powers at once, but that's not the case. In other words, you can't have more than one power at the same time, and I think that sucks. However, I still love Second Son and it's my favorite of the series because it wasn't afraid to step outside the box and use a different approach to how powers were used and acquired. With that being said, it still managed to feel like an Infamous game, which is tricky to pull off.

2.0,False,"10 13, 2010",ANQX4I6CSVS41,B006IUVDOS,Cryostatic,"<-- Graphics -->
The visuals in the game are simply stunning. I've never seen more realistic waterfalls or lightning effects than in this game. Standing on the shore, waves will roll in and darken the sand, which then lightens again once the water recedes. Caves seem infinitely dark until you step inside and your eyes adjust, and likewise, the view outside is overexposed and blinding until you do the same. Square's visual staff produces some simply amazing stuff, and the attention to even the smallest of details adds to the realism of the world. Granted, some might consider the hardware requirements a bit steep to elicit all of this wonderful imagery, but you can't deny, it's a damn pretty game.

<-- Environment -->
While the cities are fine, the outside environment leaves much to be desired. The game right now consists, literally, of three zones, each reminiscent of a primary zone in FFXI, and generally with some elements of other zones thrown in. Unfortunately, while very realistic and well done, the landscapes are devoid of anything... interesting. Very realistic, and very generic, landscapes are what await you.

<-- Sound -->
The sound, both music and effects, are what you'd expect from Square-Enix. Very well done.

<-- Combat -->
Combat classes in this game are defined by the weapon you equip, which sounds very strange at first, but makes more sense once you discover that ""classes"" are arbitrary, and only serve to indicate your level of mastery at whatever skill your main hand item uses. Combat is basically the same as it was in FFXI, with some minor adjustments. Your auto-attacks now aren't, and all of your skills use stamina, which builds up automatically during combat. TP generation (by basic attacks) is much faster, and weapon skills are a much more common element of battle. The game also has a system similar to skillchains, which might see more use if party play was necessary or even encouraged.

<-- Gathering -->
There are three gathering classes, Fisherman, Botanist, and Miner. All three employ the same mini-game (with some minor differences, mostly in terminology) which decides whether or not you've gathered successfully. Once you figure the mechanics out, it's fairly easy to keep yourself from failing repeatedly, and the learning curve is short. However, it doesn't do anything to relieve the tedium of gathering. You may welcome the gathering mini-game as a device to help you stay awake while doing it, or you may view it as just one more unnecessary task to perform in the process.

<-- Crafting -->
Crafting is necessary in this game, for equipment, and for repairs. The system itself is an irritating time sink. While there are different crafting ""methods"" that you can use during the process, it seems to have little to no effect on the outcome of the craft, except where it relates to the assessment of your guildleve work. Most of the time, unless you're well above your craft (by ten or more levels, at least) you will be using the standard method, which will involve sitting there and pressing the ""enter"" key eight or ten times while you wait for the game to decide whether you won the dice roll or not.

There are many crafting ""skills"" which, while not required by a particular craft, may be ""recommended"" for it. You can only acquire these skills through the trading of guild points, and you will suffer a rather severe penalty to the craft without them.

Repairs are one particular element of the game that I found irritating in the extreme. Even though I have friends who play who could effect repairs for me on items they made (and likewise for myself, on items made for them) we found several instances of items crafted that could not be repaired by the crafter, due to a lack of skill. Add to that the fact that we tend to be in numerous different areas, and it makes the whole thing rather inconvenient.

It wouldn't be so inconvenient if performing any sort of activity didn't reduce the durability of your items so quickly, but the biggest culprit here is your underwear, and an hour of intense play will require you to stop, swap it out for a second set that you keep on hand for this purpose only (you can't simply unequip your drawers, no going commando here) to repair. There are repair NPCs that can repair you enough to keep you going (to 75%, you suffer reduced effect at 50%) but on higher-level crafted items, the price is amazingly high for this service. When gathering, be advised to unequip anything that's expensive or not easily repaired.

<-- Economy -->
The economy directly pulls the bazaar system from FFXI. Additionally, in lieu of a mog house or bank system, you're provided with a retainer that can hold as many items as you can, and you're permitted to set this retainer up in a city's market ward, where you can basically bazaar from the NPC. There is no auction house in the game. While I can understand the reasoning behind the lack of it (camping and price-gouging issues), those reasons simply aren't good enough. Nobody wants to spend, quite literally, hours hunting through hundreds of bazaars hoping to ~maybe~ find the item they're looking for (and personally, I adamantly refuse). The abundance of bazaars makes loading agonizingly slow in both areas of town where they're prevalent, and in the market wards.

Bazaars are great for making casual sales. In FFXI, I would check people in the field or at random in towns to see if they had anything I could use, but when looking for something specific that you need, an easily searchable system, like an auction house, is quite simply required. The game's economy is utterly broken, and will remain broken, until this feature is added.

Also, there is no system in place for mail, at all. This feature's exclusion is a huge failure.

<-- Storyline and Questing -->
The storyline, what little exists of it, seems completely disconnected from the rest of the game, and as of yet, the primary storyline is the only quest line that exists in the game. Repeatable guildleves aren't quests so much as a means by which to obtain guild points, and are reset every thirty-six hours on the server's schedule.

Ultimately, this leads to a sense of pointlessness. Without any kind of purpose, you roam the landscape, killing birds, rats, and various other forms of wildlife, improving your combat skills for no particular reason other than raising a number.

<-- Other Thoughts -->
In addition to the oddity of not being able to repair an item that you can craft, there are an unusual number of low-level crafts that require high-level items. So far, ~none~ of the foods I've eaten seem to have any noticeable effect, leading me to wonder if they even HAVE effects yet, or if the developers decided to save that for later. Additionally, there are areas in the game where there are obviously supposed to be guild shops (with guild signs outside of buildings), but no shop exists to enter.

Those along with numerous other factors, leave me with the final impression that the game is simply incomplete, like they needed another month or six to flesh it out before release. I honestly feel like I'm paying to beta test. While it has a lot of nice features, and a lot of potential, and I really, really, really want to like it, I just can't recommend this game to anyone at this point.","Incomplete, a mess, and a chore.",1286928000,19,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

Its in the news, its on tv, its talked about at work, school, college etc. Families play the game together and the game has even contributed towards breaking of relationsips, falling of grades, people losing jobs etc but inspite of all these facts World of warcraft is still the best MMO out there. Lots of MMO's have come and gone trying to compete or take over the throne from this game but none have suceeded thus far. I have personally over the years have switched back and forth between wow and others mmo's to only come back to wow. This game has some strange and almost majical allure to it.

This all being said I throughly enjoy the game. It's very solo friendly. Has top-notch graphics and the biggest aspect is the huge world which truly does justice to the words 'epic' and 'massive' when its comes to mmo's. The game has both a good and a darker faction to play. The classes are numerous and well thought off too. You have everything from pure specialized classes to hybrids. Choose your faction, pick a class and off you go. The game caters to different playstyle too...for pve oriented people you have pve servers and for hardcore pvp oriented people you have pvp servers(full of gankage and griefing if thats what you like). However, the great thing about the game is that even being on pve servers you have various option to pvp and test your mettle against real players. A person can flag themselves for world pvp or participate in instanced battlegrounds(my favourite)to pvp at your time and choosing. The game also has the feel that there is a constant war going on among an epic struggle between different factions for resources and philosphies. Cities gets attacked, players gets attacked and there are constant raging battles going in battlgrounds.

But aside from all this the game offers some of the most fun questing that i have ever come across in mmo's. If you want to just quest and better your character via leveling it up than the game will grip you too and no wonder people are known to loose a part of their life to this game. But my advice....'Moderation' and you will be all happy both in real and your virtual life.

In conclusion....I will advice this game to anyone who is intrested in playing a great mmo that is not a bore also.

I enjoyed Seiken Densetsu 2 and Sword of Mana as well, but somehow I missed out on this game during its original run. Lured by the stylistic graphics and great soundtrack, I picked this up on PSN. Even at only $5.99 for play on your PSP and/or PS3, I could only recommend this for diehard Mana series fans.

The game's biggest strengths are its graphics and music. Pretty much everything else disappoints to varying degrees.

With its silent protagonist and NPCs that run off when it suits them, there really is no overarching storyline, just a series of quests. Because the steps in those quests can be so vague, long periods of time may lapse between story beats, meaning that you never quite know or care what's going on and you never get vested in any of the characters. At one point, I realized I was deliberately aiding the enemy by killing important good guys and wondered why. The only explanation is that you have to in order to finish that quest. The elemental spirits have zero role in the plot and only exist to give you coins for crafting. Wasted opportunity.

This game is extremely tedious, and the paper thin plot stringing it together makes it even more so. The backgrounds are nice to look at, but you will come across many a door that can't be opened, and what appear to be obvious paths are often inexplicably not. Final Fantasy VII had a feature that would highlight the exit paths with a triangle, but not here. I played this game downloaded to my PSP and I can't imagine how much more frustrating the numerous loading screens would be to someone playing the actual disc version of this game.

Quests are often extremely vague, and the in-game diary is worthless as an aid. Despite having a companion (frequently), there's no way to get any advice from them the way you could in, say, Dragon Quest VII. Finally, on this subject of tedium, there are the dungeons, which are simply a chore. Enemies respawn whenever you revisit a screen and you MUST defeat them in order to proceed. Since you will do a lot of wandering around, revisiting every locale on the map to try and figure out how to trigger then next stage of a quest, this gets irritating very quickly, for a very important reason...

COMBAT IS SO BORING! It feels more like a side-scrolling brawler than an RPG, because your character only really attacks left and right and everything boils down to strong and weak attack. Magic is underpowered and irrelevant and there's no concept of items. You literally just hit the attack button until your enemies are dead...which won't be long, because this is one of the easiest games I've played. Literally nothing poses a challenge and every boss, including the final one, can be defeated in about a minute just by spamming the attack button. You can make the enemies harder in New Game+, but by that point you'll probably have had enough of this game.

Overall, this game is worth the price of admission ($6 on PSN, not the ridiculous prices listed here) if you are a fan of the series. It is not a terrible game, but it pales in comparison to its predecessors. If you want to simply experience this entry in the series, I would recommend using a walkthrough just to preserve your sanity.",For Dedicated Fans Only,1425513600,,,

Which is to say in a game like Fable, I was casting spells and shooting my guns, and in oblivion I never used the swords but relied on magic.

And my favorite games are games like Mass Effect, Fallout 3, Gears, Left 4 Dead, and Call of Duty.

Which is probably why I disliked the original Assassin's Creed so much.  It felt overwhelming.  I couldn't ""get"" the combat.  I didn't enjoy it at all.  I felt like it threw you in to the deep end right from the beginning.  I played it a few hours, got probably less than 100 gamer score out of it, and put it down forever.

I found this for 39 bucks and picked it up against my better instincts.  And you know what?  I'm really starting to like it.  This game does a much better job of immersing you in the story and the controls.  It all feels more structured--though technically open world--and it is more of a guided experience.  At least the main story line is.  There's not a lot of time spent traveling, and I like that.  And as much as I hate button-mashing combat, that part of the game is actually pretty simple (no stupid combos--just fluid like on Arkham Asylum).

Sprinkle in the exploration, multiple ways to attack a plot point, and the RPG elements, and you have a very impressive game.

Playing as Spidey and being able to alternate between the classic and black costumes, you swing around New York City cracking heads and saving citizens, which is pretty much what we've been doing since Spider-Man 2.  However, what's different with Web of Shadows is that the game rarely becomes boring and the missions rarely become tedious to boot.  Also, the game's story is a surprising blast to play through.  The longer you play Web of Shadows, the more you'll get enthralled, particularly in its final acts where the symbiotes begin to wreak havoc.  The ability to (somewhat) choose your own path depending on your actions is a plus, and there's plenty of appearances from familiar faces on the sides of heroes and villains as well.  The only real flaws of Web of Shadows are technical ones.  There are some noticeable graphical glitches and sound hiccups, plus a few issues with the in-game camera.  Still, swinging around New York City has never been more fun or easy to do, and the game manages to stay entertaining from start to finish.

The game starts a bit slow, with too many cutscenes and not challenging. Worse is that the story at the beginning sucks, I thought all of Samus past and the ""thumbs down"" thing was ridiculous and I was very disappointed with the game in the first 2 hours.

Fortunately after that the game got better, more challenging and the story got interesting.

This Metroid is more action oriented and I liked that, however is also very linear, and if you don't like to search for items you can finish it in less than 8 hrs. It took me 14 hrs to finish the game but I liked to search a lot, and 20 hrs to get the 100%. The bad thing about exploration in this game is that you can only get missiles, energy and accel parts.

2.0,False,"04 12, 2015",A33DQ2GV8NJHMR,B0042Y2F76,Dan,"I'll write this review as if I'm reviewing two items. First the Ear Force DSS breakout box, and then the PX21 headset that it comes packaged with. Keep in mind, my experience here is with Win8.1 PC setup only.

The Ear Force DSS is actually a pretty solid piece of equipment. It is NOT a USB sound card. If you connect this to your PC it will never recognize it as a USB device at all. The DSS simply gets it's power through USB and also offers an additional USB pass-through port on it so you can connect other devices as if it's just a USB extension cord. The DSS takes audio input from your PC's surround sound optical output and translates that into virtual stereo surround sound, and the effect is pretty convincing. It gives your audio that 5.1 big home theater sound with realistic room reverb making it seem like there's a wide space between you and the surrounding speakers. The DSS surround sound works with ANY headphones, no need to use the headset provided. The DSS will allow you to play audio out from it's headphone jack as well as your speaker system simultaneously meaning you can quickly switch between headphones and speaker listening without unplugging anything or changing any settings. The DSS seems to add a heavy layer of bass to your audio, and without tweaking a few soundcard settings the DSS will overdrive/distort/clip any audio you play through it. Once you solve this by greatly lowering optical output levels it works great though.

The DSS is great, however, the PX21 headset that's provided is not my first choice to use along side it. The PX21 does NOT work at all without USB power provided to it, so you can't use it on an MP3 player or other audio source that doesn't have a powered USB port. The PX21 has a persistent hissing white noise that doesn't go away no matter what volume you use or what audio/usb ports you use, it's always interlaced into whatever you're listening to. If you can tolerate the white noise the audio quality is actually pretty decent, no real complaints there. Comfort wise, the ear cups are soft and breathable, but they have a kind of burlap mesh cloth on their surface that can feel a bit rough on my sensitive ears. The ear cups do not go over my ears, they rest ontop of them all around causing pressure and discomfort after 30 minutes of use. The cord is ridiculously long and heavy. if you don't clip the inline controller to your shirt you'll feel that heavy cord tugging on your left ear. I haven't tested the mic, but I assume it's fairly basic and average in performance.

Overall, DSS is a nice piece of equipment for a good virtual surround sound experience that is pretty versatile in how many ways you can use it. The PX21 headset is the weakest part of this package.","DSS breakout box is great, PX21 headset provided is not.",1428796800,,,
3.0,False,"05 6, 2009",A2P05NM8AAVFLB,B000ZKDOVW,Brian Lee,"I got this game almost a year ago. I've played the game a lot, unlocked all the characters and have played about 100 matches online. I've been a fan of Soul Calibur since Soul Calibur 2, which I purchased on my Gamecube. Soul Calibur 4 is the updated version of the series on the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3. The roster includes about 30 fighters, a dozen stages and a character creator mode.

In the singleplayer department, you get 3 modes. The first mode is Story Mode. What happens here is that you are shown a written history of the character before you even play. Then you are shown a screen with some odd collections of words such as ""A Dark Warrior"" and proceed to fight a match. New to the series, is the addition of tag teaming. With a press of a button, you can switch your characters in a match. After you beat the normal enemies you face the boss and are treated to a short cutscene.

Then there is arcade mode. In this mode, you fight enemy after enemy until you get to the end with the same boss. One thing that I think improves on SC2 is that the boss does not always predict your moves and counter it so effectively. Nor does he have some move that takes out half of you life. He's simply a normal fighter, except with twice the amount of health.

Finally, you have a Tower of Souls mode. This mode has two variations. You either ""ascend"" and fight tough enemies or you can ""descend"" and fighter hordes of weaker enemies, sort of like survival mode in the old games.

That's about it for the singleplayer modes, other than practice and character creation. Now for character creation, you can change things such as the sex, the weapon, clothes, hair/eye/skin color, name and a few other things. The clothes and items that you use also affect the attributes of your character. You can also take a custom character online.

As for multiplayer mode, you are given two options, normal and special versus. Normal is simply a normal mode, where status effects are not played. So items don't mean anything. Special versus is where the clothes you have chosen have status effects that work. Interestingly, there is no tag-team mode. You can also play online, either casual or ranked. Latency will affect gameplay, making moves much more difficult to time.

So what is my opinion on the game? As the title implies, I'm not completely satisfied. Yes, the graphics are great, the gameplay is still there and you do get more characters, but I think a lot of additions are unnecessary.

The critical finishes that they've worked in the game rarely happen and contribute nothing to the gameplay. It's just extra fluff. The character creation mode is confusing because it's not clearly explained. Choosing gear will take certain slots which is shared with abilities. Also, the equipment looks goofy and silly most of the time. Most players simply make revealing female fighters online.

Speaking of which, the female characters in the game do not need to have implants and revealing outfits. The singleplayer modes don't add new modes such as the conquest mode of SC3. They added tag-teaming in singleplayer, yet fail to include it for multiplayer, which is yet another question. Yoda just doesn't fit in the game. Having a character that can not be grabbed or horizontally attacked is cumbersome.

Online play is painful, especially if you have a slow character. Fast characters can spam their moves and interrupt fighters that operate slowly. Now you are supposed to counter these pokes with guard impacts, but that technique requires timing, which the online latency makes impossible.

The best way to play this game, as with all fighting games is with a competent buddy in your living room. The core game itself is very strategic, where pattern recognition and applying counters is a key part. Soul Calibur sets itself apart form other fighters because it's not execution that wins the game, but strategic decisions that determine the outcome.

Overall, it doesn't reinvent the series and if you have older games, the game only feels like a patch. The online mode is the only significant addition that sets SC4 apart from the older titles. If you can bear some issues with online play, then it's worth a purchase. Otherwise, I would purchase an older copy, save myself $50 or so and still experience 90% of what Soul Calibur 4 is.",Lost its Soul,1241568000,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

You can still get married, but now you can turn any house into a marriage house.  The towns look familiar, but are much bigger.  You could spend a lifetime just doing all of the side missions.

I can only guess that the hooded character on the cover is supposed to be the protagonist, despite looking like a villain, because he's the only one that even somewhat resembles the hooded character.  To be fair, it's good that they added ""Murder in"" to the title to give a better idea of what the game's about, because ""The Abbey"" alone says nothing at all about what's going on other than it takes place in a religious setting.

I have mixed feelings about the portrayal of these holy men, however--yes, having ""character flaws"" is human and more interesting to a narrative than making each one a stereotypical monk, besides providing red herrings as to the identity of the killer. However, I didn't end up liking any of them, except perhaps the cook Martin for throwing a lampshade on the fact that he knows he's being distracted. It just felt a bit forced having THAT many of the characters being revealed as so unlikable in-universe, that maybe we weren't supposed to feel so bad when bad things happened to them? How did they not all kill each other BEFORE this?

Furthermore, I got to rather dislike the protagonist, Leonardo de Toledo, after he started calling his slaveI MEAN HIS APPRENTICE Bruno stupid for not being able to grasp the Sherlock-esque leaps of logic he uses, and HATED him after he straight-up smacks him around. True, at age fourteen even in THIS day and age, Bruno should be smarter than that (unless he legitimately has learning disabilities, which makes it even worse that Leonardo beats him like a dog). Eleven or twelve I could've believed, but fourteen AND he's still that short?? Even allowing for the cartoony style, I felt like it broke my suspension of disbelief a little too much for comfort, as though we're SUPPOSED to think Bruno deserves a beating. I was tempted to let Leonardo die, but sadly the game doesn't allow it... props at least that there's no way to get ""stuck"" to where you can't progress due to having not picked up a vital item that's no longer available.

Most of my other complaints are nitpicky: Some of the puzzles, such as the one the rolling pin's used for, don't make sense, and I had to consult a walkthrough to solve those plus the ones I knew how to solve except I missed a step about talking to a different person first before the game would let me solve that puzzle. There are a LOT of quality-control issues in the spoken dialogue not matching the captions (which are too close to the edge of the screen), and in several scenes the Abbot stands backwards, looking away from the action. Also, the inventory is WAY too cluttered and arranged arbitrarily--I couldn't solve a puzzle because I didn't notice the item I was supposed to use was in a completely different location from the similar item I was trying to use. There's really no reason to have THAT many inventory slots, or to not be able to arrange the items better.

I do admit the game was slightly better than I expected, which is why it's not one star, but it still wasn't really worth my investment of time trying to get it to install when autoplay wouldn't run. Overall I guess it's okay for an afternoon-ish of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING better to do, but I wouldn't recommend buying it, not even to try to fulfill your Free Shipping quota for Amazon.",Deceiving on many levels,1460851200,,,

In fact, I would say, in terms of song selection, this game's better than the sequel.  A word on that: the songs are covered, not the original performers.  The learning curve is relatively gradual, although there's a substantial increase in difficulty between medium and hard mode.  But within each level of difficulty, the game does a good job of slowly increasing the complexity of how you're moving your fingers across the fretboard.  The game also appeals to a wide variety of ability levels.  Easy and medium modes are great for the casual player.  Hard and extreme provide the expected levels of difficulty to players who want more out of the game.  The unlockable extras (unlocked with in-game cash) were well done, as none of them affect gameplay itself, but rather provide additional content to players who ""put in the time.""  This way, the game isn't turning away the less-addicted just because they didn't feel like getting carpal tunnel just to make a little extra game cash.

There are two factors that detract from the gaming experience: hammer-ons/pull-offs and the brevity of the game.  Hammer-ons/pull-offs were greatly improved in the sequel, but they weren't quite as polished as they could have been for this entry.  As a result, they can be tricky to do properly, and it doesn't feel like it would on a real guitar.  And the game's not necessarily short, there are just less songs in a career than the sequel.  One other point worth mentioning: the absence of a practice mode is also a drawback.

This is a great title for anyone who ever wanted to play guitar with a rockin' band, but hasn't yet devoted the time to learning how to play.  If you've ever turned your stereo up and rocked out, this game's for you.  If you've had a rough week and you just need to dance it out... go buy Dance Dance Revolution.

In short, it's a great game.  It's a wonder no one thought of this sooner.  It would have earned 5 stars if I had reviewed it BEFORE playing the sequel.","Better songs, a shorter experience",1173312000,26,,

4.0,False,"03 26, 2008",A3JUMMIGJ7B38X,B0010YOQIW,GarionOrb,"When Square-Enix puts out a numbered Final Fantasy title, it never disappoints.  But it's been painfully clear that any Final Fantasy spin-offs based on those games will miss the mark.  Such is the case with Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII.  If you're expecting the same engrossing gameplay and engagement you had playing the original Final Fantasy VII, you'll be sorely disappointed.

The bad:
-Horrible, and I do mean HORRIBLE play control.  You can seriously play through the battles blindfolded.  All you do is simply hit the X button.  The character moves on his own.  Square-Enix should've either given us traditional turn-based battles or fully controllable God of War-style battles, not this weak combination of both.

-The actual game is very short, with only 10 chapters.  After two hours of play, I was already in chapter 4, and that's after taking a good chunk of time doing side-missions as well.

-Side missions extend the game slightly, but they're also very short and not very engaging.

-DMW, which is a slot-machine-type meter that spins throughout the battle.  The player has no control over it, and this is what determines if you or your attributes level up, or if you perform a limit break or use a summon.  Basically, your progress and level is determined entirely at random (A level up happens when the first and last symbol match AND this corresponds to a 777).  No skill is required.

So why, you ask, did I give this game 4 stars?

The good:
Story - Plain and simple, the story is absolutely incredible.  The cutscenes are stunning, especially for the PSP.  The voice acting is the best I've ever heard...period.  The characters are convincing and engrossing.  The atmosphere throughout the game is classic FFVII, and this alone is why you won't be able to put the game down.

A review from GameInformer said that it's well worth trudging through some of the worst gameplay ever just to see this story to the end, and I whole-heartedly agree.  I'm hooked on it, and I'll gladly waste hours on side missions in the hope that I'll randomly level up, just so I can be strong enough to beat the final boss and bridge this story with Final Fantasy VII.","Cinematic and beautiful, but...",1206489600,18,{'Edition:': ' Limited'},

What I've noticed so far is that there is no ""cheating"". No one can steal your mobs or loot, there is limited powerlevelling since those outside your group can't help you except between fights, and if the entire group is working on a quest everyone gets credit for it rather than the first person to grab the quest item.

Yes all that and more is here in the 3ds version.  That might sound none too appealing, but if you're like me and rememeber the satisfaction you got from getting past that annoying enemy and getting to the end to the level you'll love it here too.

At its core, IMO NMS isn't a 4X game. Or a space simulator. It isn't really even a traditional space trader or combat game. And although exploration is key, it isn't really a true space-ex game. And it's not a ""find Waldo with a scanner"" game, even though you often feel it is, when the one species you haven't identified on the planet is more endangered than the dodo or the great auk. And even though you do a lot of mining, that activity isn't the definitive core of the game either.

So what is NMS?

Instead, I think NMS is the ultimate casual game. Yes I know its incredibly repetitive and limited in scope but I find the rinse-and-repeat gameplay strangely soothing. It's not cerebral by any means (even the puzzles are simple) but it's low challenge level means that you can easily play it while listening to some good music on Spotify and just zone out to the golden-age-of-sci-fi vibe.

In fact, I haven't played any of my usual go-to casual games since I got my hands on NMS on launch day, and that's saying something.

tl;dr: NMS is like Minecraft in Space meets Bejewelled meets Myst meets Ace Combat and they all have a baby with Spore. I like it a lot.",Frankengame...,1471392000,,,

4.0,False,"09 17, 2012",A1BB4H9G9APMT3,B001TOQ8X4,Da Jester,"I really tried to not like this game. I was part of the Star Wars fans hoping that Star Wars the Old Republic (SWTOR) to be my new World of Warcraft (WOW) MMO gameplay addiction. However, after it's bitter defeat to the free to play model, I was proven once again nothing will be ever as good as WOW. And the sad part is I'm a year sober from WOW, because 6 years of the same game I've played and paid for, enough is enough. In the past, I completely hated the original Guild Wars. Hated everything to how it's played to the end game, UI and control scheme, and the severe lack of MMO variety. The only thing that I held respect for it was the buy software, play online for free model and the stand alone expansion idea. Over the past couple of years, I got sick of reading about the sequel's hype comments from user forum posts and other threads on various game websites. Well, they weren't lying, because Guild Wars 2 (GW2) completely delivers.

What you get for a $59.99 and NO later subscription fees is a complete breath of fresh air to the Massively Multiplayer Online market. I've played almost 40 hours of the game with a level 14 Asura elementatlist, 42 Norn warrior, and a 10 Sylvari thief. It doesn't seem like much and I'm sure I probably would be level 60 or above if I focused on one character, but GW2 has so much inside of it.

The most notable feature is how you quest. No more running to an area filled with!'s,?'s, or Triangles above NPCs and doing fetch, retrieve, and backtracking to them. Each quest has its own variety involving the area you run into, and provide multiple ways of completion. No more ""filled quest logs,"" because each one is tied to the area they reside. All of them are public, meaning anything you hit and loot among other players become your own. You get XP for helping somebody kill something, and you don't even have to be in their party to do it! No more having to wait for something to spawn and getting frustrated because another player claiming that one item or killing that one NPC you needed for quest completion. Crafting material gathering is also in this same category! Everybody can hit the same node and receive the materials (also random bonuses) and XP they need. Cooperation and public are key word to GW2's level grind. Much like Warhammer Online's Public quests, there are a wide variety of dynamic world events where it just involves players showing up to and the area and helping each other get the job done...except GW2 does it better! There have been countless times other players and I completely drop what we were doing to run to the announced area and assist each other in a world event. Some of these can be small and then have a larger scale depending on what you are doing. I read that later on they become bigger and more epic in scale for later levels. Other players can even help you in your profession (class) story quests. Speaking of these, your profession's story quests can actually be branched out depending on choices you make. Near level 30, the player is tasked with deciding between 3 orders to serve, the Priory, the Vigil, and the Whispers. So to get the most out of Guild Wars 2, play at least 3 characters. If PVE is not your total thing and you don't like grinding levels to get to endcap PVP, then don't worry. You can do PVP to level up by partaking in WVW, where you are scaled to 80 with your current gear and skill unlocks, or structured objective PVP, where you character is scaled to 80 with high teir PVP gear and all skill unlocks....I think. I've only done a small bit of WVW, so don't quote me on that.

Oh, another thing I hated about the first GW, you couldn't jump! It's almost as if the developers went crazy and added all of these vistas and plat forming jumping area puzzles to say ""we're sorry."" The game rewards you more for completely discovering areas. Finding all of the Points of interest, vistas, skill challenges, waypoints and completing all quests reward you with actually good random items. Not some title, and a tabard but useful items, like stones to transmogrify gear, bank/trading post conveniences, XP boosters, and coins to craft high level gear to name a few I've received.
The second most notable feature is that the presentation of GW2 is through the roof. From the character creation screen, viewing the races' intro videos, then to your first steps into visually pleasing environments; GW2 does not hold anything back. Yes, there isn't a pretty CGI cut scene to explain and introduce the world of Tyria to the player, but who really needs them!? The art scheme and design of everything for this game can be described like a beautiful watercolor painting. It truly is a work of digital art on an epic landscape scale. The character models and their animations are purely awesome. Unlike SWTOR, when you pick a race, YOU PICK A RACE and not some copy N paste with little difference of one character model. From the small floppy eared Asura, to the huge bulky Charr, or even the actual plantlike and unique Sylvari; all 5 races of GW2 are unique to each other. The dynamics of the UI astounded me of all of the different effects happening around the screen be it buffs, combat state, diving in water, and etc.  Combat animations, something that is plaguing WOW for years, are not bland what so ever. Spells and melee combat simply flourishes with amazing presentation. Even while swimming in water, there are unique underwater combat animations to the aquatic weapons you yield. What about the Sound and music of GW2? No sound in this game is below 11. The legendary Jeremy Soule, composer for the Elder Scrolls games, once again knows how to serenade the player with beautiful music depending on what area and player state. All races either male or female have wonderful voice actors that have a surprising amount of dialogue be it in combat, emote, or storyline quest cut scenes.
Now, right here is the one feature that is really making it hard for me to reconsider re-subscribing to WOW again: GW2's skill based combat. Instead of choosing a class and being tied to down to obvious restrictions involving skills through a level grind, GW2 introduces weapon based skills.  At first I was scared that the basic Torchlight/Diablo 3ish action bars, But then I discovered this: Depending on what weapons your character can wield, a different skill set is presented for each. For example:  A warrior can use a rifle, does that mean he's not as effective with it? HELL $#%&ING NO! A new set of skills pop up and depending on how you build the character; it's another example of effective DPS. At level 7 you unlock weapon swapping. So that warrior I mentioned could switch from their rifle, to their 1 handed/off hand, or 2 handed weapon for close quarters combat with a press of a button. The ""mage class"" the elementalist, can switch out his/her staff and duel wield daggers with completely different skills set that have completely different effects. Also, there is no designated ""holy trinity"" of the basic group design. No more designated tank, healer, and dps classes, BECAUSE EVERYBODY CAN DO IT. If a fight gets too hard, back out, heal up, switch weapons, and try something else. It is literally up to the player how they want to play their game. The only real choice is what weapons to bring to the fight.

There are many other awesome features in GW2 that that I could talk about, but this review is already long enough.  However, this review can't be complete without some negatives.

1.  The first and obvious one is that you need a pretty good computer to view/play this game. The low settings provided turn the game into a fuzzy mess that really doesn't look...well it looks like Dark Age of Camelot to be honest.  But no matter what, expect lots of visual lag when you are doing WVW PVP.

2.  PVP: On WVW, one of the main marketed features of GW2 is very huge and dynamic. I mean there are 3 servers fighting each other on a huge scaled map. No matter what PC you have, expect LOTS and LOTS of visual lag due to the player count and the nonstop combat effects on the battlefield. This kind of hurt WVW to me, because it turns into a giant clustercuss fast. It's nice you can participate in WVW PVP at level 2, be level capped with other players, but right now it's pretty overbearing. I have not done that much of it. I like the idea, but the lag fest and mayhem made me want to go back into the PVE more. This is literally Alterac Valley on Venom...WOW and Batman fans would get that reference.

3.  I'm not really sure how successful the Auction House, or Black Lion Trading post is. For one, you can't initial trade with players. You have to use mail to trade. The trading post can be accessed anywhere your player is to sell items, but it can be laggy at times. And I know this may affect some players' views on game economy, there really isn't a ""pay to win"" situation parse, but you can purchase game currency through this.

4. Speaking of game currency, mentioned before, this game is the buy software, play online for free model.  So there will be restrictions to it because of the non-wide array of server support most AAA MMOS have. When you pick a server, that's it. It becomes your home.  You only have 5 character slots to choose. If you want more, you have to buy from Arena.net's website. Want more bank and inventory space, got to buy it from them.

5. New players to GW2 and even other MMO veterans will feel lost at some point. The game does have some tutorial sections and a help option, but nothing in your face telling you how to perform actions like crafting. I had to go to youtube to figure out where and how I begin crafting. But most of the time, issues like this become minor nuisances after you figure it out. The maps are very detailed, but almost too cluttered. Grouping with players might actually be more difficult to locate each other, because the light blue dot can get overshadowed by a map's many icons. There is also the overflow issue for the current server populations loads. Overflow is actually a nice tool allowing you to play the PVE game anytime during a server queue. But for grouping, it can be a nuisance to be in the same queue as your party member.

6. (updated) The dungeons can be a clustercuss, especially if you are melee. I was labeled the obligatory ""u bad"" by my fellow party members because a boss fight scenario was literally hard for me to tell what's going on. Usually if the target/boss is going to do something area effect wise, a red circle appears as a warning where the area is going to be affected. With the dodge mechanic, one would simple dodge,...however each of the 5 professions in a dungeon group have flourishing effects with their skills. These, at first spectacular animations, do make things difficult to recognize what's going on; especially having the ranged and hybrid professions in your party. In WVW, it only gets worse. I love the design of the ability animations, but no matter what players will say, the fights in dungeons can just be wipe fests. Try a fight where there are more then one NPC to kill and red circles keep popping up. These dungeon encounters can start interesting then result with aggravation when your heaviest attacks are melee based and you are constantly dodging red circles (if you can see them)all the time. The good thing is you can respawn and run back to the fight from a nearby waypoint without the boss encounters locking you out or resetting. If any player in your party criticizes you claiming that ""well, I can see them, and I have 0 problems, you just bad"" comments, they are usually the ranged professions and have not played something mostly melee yet. I strongly suggest to group with players you know personally and use some sort of voice communication. I've done the 3 dungeons that my current level allows me to enter, and all of them have been exactly what I described. I appreciate Arenanet's ""to differentiate from"" approach with dungeons, but these so far only gave me headaches instead of enjoyment.

This game has more inside its $59.99 package that meet the eye. I apologize for adding yet another long review to amazon, but there is so much to explain about GW2. For example, how easy it is to organize your crafting materials at crafting stations, banks, or through the hero menu. It's simply another example of the positives outweighing the negatives, much like a Charr and Asura on a titter totter; it's that grand. Classic Everquest and World of Warcraft MMO veterans really need try this game out. I'm pretty sure even the nit pickiest MMO game player would find something unique to it. To really explain GW2, is to simply play it yourself and try out the 3 ways to build your character: PVE, PVP, or simply exploring. This version of Tyria may not be the cup of tea to most, but for those seeking something new to the MMO market, Guild Wars 2 raises the bar in combat, exploration, and just pure immersion... and with no subscription fee!","The Perfect Example ""Buy Software, Play Online for Free"" MMO",1347840000,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It has good games and stuff, but the Genesis ports sound like something that would be on the Master System. When a 16 bit game sounds like an 8 bit game, you know you have a problem. It seems like all the work went into the only two games that weren't Genesis games. Virtua Cop 2 was perfectly ported from the Sega Saturn, and Sega Swirl is primarily a Dreamcast game.

Another major flaw is that if you want to change the game, you have to reboot the Dreamcast. It gets annoying.

It says that each Genesis game was test played, but if it was, IT WOULDN'T SOUND LIKE NES, and the switching games thing is a problem that Sega had since the first compilation on the Genesis, the Sonic compilation.

The top screen, on the other hand, was really difficult to apply. Since it covers the entire top half of the 3DS, it's just too big to be able to put on without getting some kind of dust or bubbles under it. I eventually gave up and decided to just use the bottom protector. That's the more important one anyway, since that's the touch screen.

In reply to some of the other reviews on here, these protectors arrived in perfect condition, with no scratches or anything. All stickers and labels were exactly as they should be.

I would be fine with the looks, accept the product hinders gameplay. The camera needs to see the glowing orb in its entirety in order to work properly. The sword, when thrust forward or swung forward, blocks the camera's view of the glob so that the motion in the game becomes jittery.

For anyone that has ever played one of these turned-based 2D strategy games (FF Tactics, Tactics Ogre, Disgaea, Shining Force series, etc.), this may be the best one ever made.  I am usually bored to tears by stories in RPGs and skip through them as fast as possible, but this one is succinct and compelling enough to keep me interested without getting bored.

The battle system, probably simpler than FFT, is still pretty deep.  Most characters are lumped into a ""job"" of sorts, mostly distinguished by their weapon (2-H axe-weilders are strong, lots of HP, but slow, 1-H sword users are faster, more versatile, but not as powerful, etc.).  Characters are customizable by skill slots (up to 6 by the end of the game).  The game is difficult, especially early on, without being cheap.  As I got about 2/3 of the way into it, I started doing a lot of the ""extra"" battles, which leveled my characters and made the storyline battles quite a bit easier, but the battles were still fun.

The only complaint I have is a forced missed character.  At one point in the story you have to choose between two paths, and depending on which path you take you get 1 of 2 characters.  You can never get the other without a second play through.  These gimmicks for the sake of ""replay value"" bug me, since at this point in my life I usually can't get through a game once, much less twice.

4.0,False,"05 23, 2006",A1DU8G4KYPXP09,B000EGELP0,Anne Omniuss,"I bought this game for two reasons.  The first reason is that I love puzzle games.  The second reason is because I wanted a way to compete with my husband! This game delivers on both counts.  You can store up to 4 files on the game which track the daily progress and Brain Age of each player. (It also has a Quick Play option for people who don't want to track their progress.)  It can also compare graphs of the results for each player so you can really tell how well you're doing compared to to other people using the game.
 The game gives you three tests to determine your ""brain age.""  My only complaint about the game is that one test involves saying colors but the game is extremely picky when recognizing the word ""blue"" which can be frustrating.
 After you've tested your brain age, then you can choose from a series of activities which ""train"" your brain.  The more you use the game, the more activities become available.  I've only had the game a week and so far I can choose from doing a series of either 20 or 100 simple math problems, reading aloud, a game called Low to High which requires memorizing numbers in a series, syllable count, and a game called Head Count where you must keep track of people moving rapidly in and out of a house.  The game tracks your daily progress of this and tells you how you're doing.  At the end of each activity you are told whether you did it at walking, bicycle, car, train, jet, or rocket speed.  So far the games are fun and take only minutes to get through.
 This game also comes with Sudoku puzzles which are tracked separately from the daily ""brain training.""  It gives tips on how to do the puzzles and has various levels of difficulty.  I did not know how to do Sudoku puzzles before I bought the game but have learned from playing it.  Admittedly, I'm still on the basic puzzles and have not logged in very impressive times on them!
  My [...] son likes playing this game but overall I wouldn't recommend it for children under the age of 10.  The game says that 20 is the ideal brain age so it isn't accurate for people under 20.  My son usually comes out with a brain age of 50 or 60.  The math puzzles require knowing the multiplication tables and reading aloud requires a pretty good vocabulary. (So far the reading material has been excerpts from 18th and 19th century literature.) This would make the game nearly impossible or incredibly frustrating for kids under a certain age.
  Needless to say, the sound and graphics aren't state of the art on this game but it's not really what the game is about. If you like puzzles or are just looking for a game that doesn't take too long to play and is easy to learn then you might enjoy this.",Fun and addictive,1148342400,6,,

3.0,True,"04 6, 2008",A2J2DPF8G1L9GI,B000E2D3LC,John Towler,"This review speaks to both Rome and Barbarian Invasion. There are some differences, but the gameplay is essentially the same.

I'm a long time fan of strategy war games going all the way back to the first Strategic Conquest game by Delta Tao.  I love every flavor of Civilization, from Sid Meier's to Stardock, and games like Stronghold.  So, I was looking forward to playing Rome because I thought it had elements of all of those classics.  And it does.  You have to build and maintain cities, raise armies and duke it out on the battlefield.

But it just didn't grab me.  Not in the way those other games did.  For one thing, I never could figure out what made one city a happy cash cow and another city a money pit full of pissed off plebes.  It seemed to have more to do with population than with infrastructure or tax rates (certain buildings give moral bonuses; higher tax rates make people unhappy).  It just seemed kind of random.  The only way to conquer a city and not have a riot on your hands for ten terms seemed to be to enslave the population or exterminate them.  Me, I don't even like to step on a Sim Ant when I can avoid it.

I played Rome: Total War through one time as the Romans and Barbarian Invasion through three times; once as the Saxons, once as the Romans and once as the Horde...actually I never finished the Horde game.  I was just over it by that point.

So, as with most games, it's going depend on what the player enjoys and the sort of game they like to play as to whether or not Rome is for you.  By this point, the game is old enough where you can find it fairly cheap on E-bay or Amazon, so it's worth checking out.  I think part of my problem was reading all these rave reviews, I had big expectations that weren't quite satisfied.  Hope you get more out of it.",It was okay.

There are well over 1,000 cars in the game, but here's the thing, less then 200 are the new ""premium"" models which have the fully detailed interiors and exteriors.  It's already been said on countless websites that they took the old models from Gran Turismo 4, and just gave them a higher resolution and basically copied them over to GT5.

Now that we got that out of the way you will only like GT5, if you liked the past GT games.  Nothing new has really changed, other than the graphics really.  Weather effects are really cool when driving through the rain.  I could stare at the rain/windshield wipers all day long because it looks so real.  The game played at 1080p which is also a plus.

Some things I wasn't real big on was even after installing almost 8GB of data during the install, the game still takes a long time to load.  You would think with an install that big, most things would be instant. This is a racing game after all.  Not some open world adventure game.  Like I said earlier about the car count, another con is a majority of cars you are going to be playing with won't have the nice detailed interiors.  You can buy cars at the ""used dealership"" in the game but for the most part I think they are all the standard cars.  You will be doing a lot of buying from there since that is where you buy the older cars that certain races need.  There is also the ""new car"" dealership that carries the premium models but the selection isn't that big.
Another con I have is the way the menu's and overall game is set up.  Certain things take forever to do.  Lets say you want to wash your car.  Once you get to the option you have to sit through like a 10-15 second animation of people washing your car.  Same with changing the oil.  It may not seem like a complaint, but after spending so much time with the game and dealing with countless menu's and loading times, i'd rather just skip any extra animations and get back on my way to playing the game.

I'm going to wrap this up by saying, if you have always hated the older Gran Turismo games, this game will not change your mind.  I did have fun with it in small doses but overall it needs some work.  If you are in the mood for a ""fun"" racing game, this game may not be for you.

This is particularly true for Project Zero / Fatal Frame cos the whole novelty of the Camera Obscura should have worn out by now. It won't be an easy job to keep players to continue with the series if Tecmo can't make it interesting. However, Tecmo once again did a brilliant job with third game in the series.

For people new to the series, it is a survival horror using a camera as your only weapon to survive the nights. As a result the adventure is split between first and third person view. You explore in the third person view but battle in the first person view. The control seems clumsy at the beginning but once you understand the logic then it is very intuitive. The camera functions are more or less the same with the last two games but this time round the difference made is instead of playing as one character, you play as 3 different character using the same yet different cameras. As a result when the story force you as another character, you have to readjust the skills, reaction time and the abilities of the cameras. Upgrade points are shared among all 3 characters, which makes decisions for upgrading a very strategic part of the game. Since the battles are in first person view you will need to switch between the two views regularly as though you can move around in the first person view, ghosts don't just stay inside your frame for you. This could be annoying when it comes to really fast ghost that even come up from the ground.

Story wise, it closely ties into the first two games and even one of the characters is from the first game. So when you play as her you feel like you relive the first game's nightmare while at the same time new uncertainties comes in. The familiarity factor works really well, though it resembles the tactic used in Eternal Darkness on the GameCube. Also the story in this game further explained certain things in the first and the second game, making the play through more rewarding as you will want feel like ""wow it's because of this that things happened in the first and second games were like that!"" It's a cleverly written plot.

Some of the cut scenes are brilliantly done and can give you shock from time to time. Even subtle things happened in the game and the appearance of enemies can make you shiver too. It's a game best played with lights off to feel the tension. The vibration function works really well as whenever the controller vibrates, you have to think whether it's an enemy or just an event to record. That puts further tension in the gameplay.

This game is AWESOME!
This game plays like a movie, much in the same as Metal Gear Solid2. What's that mean? There are cutscenes/CGI movies galore and in the end, it is very difficult to distinguish from the movies and in-game play. The graphics are that darn good! In fact, the power of the PS2 (and the DVD format) is showing just how great a game Square can make. No longer is the archaic technoloy of the PSX stoping them!
That's just graphics. Control is tight, the characters are excellent, and the story is intriguing. Square put a lot of thought and energy into this game, moreso than I've noticed from the past 3.
At 1st look, I can understand how some gamers might hold back because of the last couple of stinkers. The characters are human again, like FF8. The primary character, Tidus, is a blitzball player. While a sport in an RPG might sound distracting or just plain dumb, it really looks awesome in motion. Tidus is a teenager and very much acts like it. Yuna, the summoner, is slowly getting into her role. Lulu, the resident sorceress, does a good job of being a pill. Wakka is great fun (maybe stereotypical Hawaiian or Samoan) and exudes a light heartedness in what is a fairly dark game. Auron acts as a mentor and Rikku is kind of a Selphie/Yuffie combination. Why do I spend time on the characters? Because the story can be solid, but if the characters stink, the game will be poor.
This is not like the old FF games where it's knights in shining armor. It's not like FF7 with a futuristic apocalyptic world. Maybe a bit more like FF8, but way better.
The new magic system might seem goofy, but I'm really liking it. The in-game tutorials aren't as annoying as most. In fact, the tutorials are a part of the game, which is very nice. The menu is easy to navigate. The battle system is now turned-based, rather than that horrible Active Battle Meter. The greatest addition is being able to bring in unused characters during a battle!
What can I compare this game to? It's has elements of Star Trek:TNG, Matrix and Chrono Cross/Trigger. (I'm not far enough into it to be concrete about this one) Time seems to be playing a role. But I can't tell if Tidus is hopping from dimension to dimension, in time, OR altered reality.  As you get even further into the game, there are some major plot twists.  Some you can see coming, others leave your head spinning.
I firmly believe that THIS is THE game for which you would buy a PS2. Like FF7 bringing in millions of new game players, FFX is setting another standard.
Are you still in doubt? Go rent Final Fantasy the movie DVD and watch the preview for this game. That alone will make you more than interested and excited.

The PC version is the best version, that is for sure, quite frankly i'd take a keyboard over a controller anyday. Max Payne is a really, really long game, why people said the game was short is beyond me. Graphically it is pretty average, the character models are terribly ugly and the faces just look cut & pasted on the characters. Also, the one thing i always find amusing about Rockstar games is that no matter who develops the games for Rockstars, you can pull any weapon out of your pockets, no matter what size, that makes me laugh.
This game is almost like watching a full blown movie. I loved the way they told the story, almost like a comic book, which is really cool. Bullet-time is also a nice feature, for a video game that was really original and almost every game has tried to copy it since.
I really liked the character, Mona Sax was my favorite, even though she wasn't used as much as she would be in Max Payne 2, her character really did stand out in Max Payne.

First of all, they were packaged well and arrived in perfect condition. But you do need to make sure you are aware of what you are getting. For full functionality, you will need to buy these with the separately-sold headset adapter wires. The headphones alone only include a splitter for the input/mic wires. Even though it says ""Xbox"" right on the box, without the adapter cables, you can't natively connect these to an Xbox 360. If you have a newer Xbox One controller, or the Xbox One stereo headset adapter attachment, you can natively use this on an Xbox One. If you have a PS4, all those controllers accept a standard 3.5mm input, so you'll be good there too. But Xbox 360/PS3 will need the extra adapter wires. PC depends on what functionality you want. You can use the standard included cables on PC, but as with all of them, the extra adapter set gives you USB support and in-line adjustable mic/game volume.

If you do get the adapter cables set with this, you'll pretty much be prepared for anything. But with this compatibility freedom comes a prerequisite of holding a master's degree in electrical engineering. Look at the wiring diagram picture I posted to this review for an example setup for Xbox 360. It's kind of crazy; wires everywhere. It's not really too bad to figure out if you follow the diagram, but it does mean you need to conquer your fear of wires if you are used to wireless solutions. On the plus side though, no built-in batteries to recharge and worry about becoming obsolete in a couple years.

The sound quality on these is surprisingly good for unpowered headphones this cheap. They provide a good full range of sound, which is much better than any other headset I've tried in this price range (though you shouldn't expect them to outperform higher-end ones).

I love the style, it seems they borrowed a lot of elements from Steelseries Siberia headphones, which I also own. The adjustable headstrap works well, and the mic is easily adjustable.

The only negative on the comfort factor is the ears are a little bit skewed to a forward tilt. What I mean by that is, they do not sit flush over my ears, because the rear end of them is lifted up from behind my ears. I keep trying to gently bend them back a little bit, but they are not built to be adjustable in this direction, so they just go right back after I take my hands off them. This is too bad because the sound quality is so much better with a sealed, firm connection. You lose a lot of the lower range of sound without a good, close seal. So while I'm very impressed with the sound quality as I press them against my ears, it degrades sharply as I take my hands off them and they tilt forward again, breaking the seal (and becoming less comfortable).

*Summary*

Pros:
[+] Seriously great value at this low price point
[+] Excellent style (blatant copy of Siberia Elites?)
[+] Sound and mic quality are well above my expectations for the price range
[+] Compatible with nearly everything when purchased with adapter cables set
[+] Even without adapter cables, compatible with PS4 & newer Xbox One controllers out of the box
[+] Adjustable headband makes these comfortably fit most head sizes

With it's pedigree consisting of Bungie, the team behind the cultural monolith that is the Halo series, along with Activision pouring upwards of $500 million dollars into advertising, it's tough to remove one's self from the sheer hype surrounding the title. Can destiny possibly deliver on that hype?

The short answer is no. If you come into the experience hoping it will be the next halo, you'll be sorely disappointed.

That's not to say Destiny is a bad game by any means. The gunplay is solid and the art direction is wonderful. Unfortunately though, I don't foresee this game having much staying power beyond a weekend or two, as there simply isn't enough substance here to really push you to play beyond those initial 20 hours or so.

For starters, there isn't much respite from the incredibly repetitive missions. Pretty much every mission involves touching down on a planet, walking or riding to a instanced area, and then slowly pushing forward through waves of samey enemies until you reach a waypoint, where you hold down a button and your ""ghost"" companion gives you some vague or nonsensical plot information entirely through speech. At which point, you return to your ship so you can do it all again (But not before sitting through up to a full minute of loading screens). I've played for 20 hours so far and I have yet to play through a mission that deviates from this structure.

The levels themselves are beautiful and wide open, and you can often find loot boxes in little alcoves off the beaten path, so traversing them can actually be quite fun. Unfortunately you'll be visiting the same ones over and over and over again. The landscapes are otherwise fairly sparse of actual gameplay, besides the occasional firefight, so revisiting the areas often leads to them feeling rather lifeless once you peel back the beautiful exterior.

This is all tolerable when you are playing with friends, as the game encourages you have 2 other people in your fire-team. But if you are alone, the completely milquetoast missions and sparse gameplay will start to grind on you and you'll likely lose interest fast.

Speaking of multiplayer, it can be a bit of a mixed bag. There isn't really any sort of chat outside the 3 people in your fireteam, which is somewhat puzzling considering the obvious multiplayer focus. There also doesn't seem to be any sort of matchmaking for those who only want to play PVP, which is a bit surprising considering this is the team that made Halo for crying out loud.

I've been focusing on the negatives in this review, and that may not be entirely fair. The gunplay is actually very satisfying and the sound design is superb. Everything just feels right and has the appropriate impact. If you can get a group of 3 people together to romp through some missions and then get a group together to play some PvP, there is certainly a satisfying experience to be had here. If you're just looking for a good FPS multiplayer experience to break in your PS4 at a time where there isn't that much of a selection, I have no reservations recommending Destiny, because it is actually a solid title with a lot of graphical and gameplay polish.

But if you're coming at the game expecting it to be the next Halo, or are planning on playing it alone, I'd say this is safe to pass on.",A solidly 3-star experience,1410307200,333,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

As the series got more popular, more and more characters got added to the list with more and more secrets to learn and find. Now, in todays age, you can get the complete set of the first 3 games as a packaged deal for a very low price. The only version that they still need to update or fix is Mortal Kombat Trilogy, but that's another story.

The game series itself is very well setup. You can choose which game you can play and then from there choose your character and see how much you know from your experience. The games play is not bad and sound could use a little more work. For $10 for all 3 games, you can't go completely wrong. My major issue is the following...

You do have to have a STEAM account, as well as a ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE"" account. The reason for the ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE"" account is so you can input the serial that STEAM will provide you with once the game activated on STEAM first. (Hope you followed that closely, but wait, it gets worse) Now, with that said, I should also warn you, there are issues with this game because of the 2 accounts you have to have. If you install the game and you can't get past the ""PRESS ENTER"" intro screen, you are in for some frustration. Here is how you will have to handle this issue from what I have read from some forums on steam and other gaming sites...

1.) Activate game on the STEAM account
2.) Install the game on your PC
3.) If you run the game and can't get past the ""PRESS ENTER"", do the following
4.) Uninstall any/all ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE"" applications on your PC (Including the extra Apps)
5.) Reinstall ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE""
6.) If during the install, it shows you had something else already still installed, you have to uninstall that to and start over
7.) If you did a complete FRESH install of ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE"" This should fix the problem
8.) Now, run the game and it should NOW ask you for the serial that STEAM will provide you with

Now, if this does not clear up the problem, I don't know what to tell you. This is how I was able to get this to work for me for I had the same ""PRESS ENTER"" issue like a lot of people have had. Basically, it requires you to have all your original ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE"" programs installed as well as used for your copy of Windows on your PC.

Overall, the game works great. My only other issue is the Online play (If you can call it that) is not as effective as you might think. Lag issues, slowdown, sometimes even interrupted for whatever reason it will be. Personally, I just have this game for the game itself, not for the online play. So, if you get this game, please make sure you have a ""FRESH"" copy of ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE"" installed. I have heard that getting the ""Retail"" version is much easier than getting the downloaded copy. Since I didn't get the retail version, I can't say if that is true. Just be ready for a headache when you do purchase the ""Download"" version of this game. Good luck getting this game to work.","Great game for Mortal Kombat Fans, Not so great for STEAM and Windows LIVE accounts...",1376697600,3,,

3D platformers are a relatively new gaming genre. Although it didn't start the actual genre, Super Mario 64 is considered the father of 3D platform games and started the craze that led to many imitations and several successful games. 3D platforming stemmed off from the extremely successful, arguably the most of any video game genre, 2D platform gameplay. However, it wasn't as easy as just switching to 3D. Several mechanics had to be changed, such as jumping. Characters didn't just jump straight; characters could jump in any direction. Super Mario 64 acknowledged these problems and worked around them to create one of the most popular and successful sub-genres in all of video game history. I am happy to say that Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy has come very close to perfecting this genre.

What This Game is All About:
 The game is started out by having the player listen to what sounds like an older man questioning the world he lives in and how it came to be. He then starts to say that he feels that the answers are intertwined with a young boys destiny and how this boy is reckless (pfftteenagers). The boy, whose name is Jak, is with his friend Daxter on a boat. They are heading to an island that Daxter claims they weren't supposed to go to. Long story short, they go there, they run into trouble, Daxter gets turned into an Ottsel (a mix between an otter and weasel), they go back to their place, and they end up finding out that the only way to change Daxter back is to find a sage who lives far to the north. So, they begin their adventure.

 The playable character is Jak, with Daxter sitting on his shoulder. In a brief training level, they find out about several items that they must collect: Power Cells, Precursor Orbs, and Scout Flies. Power Cells are the main collectible in the games, similar to the Stars in Super Mario 64. They get these for completing tasks, such as helping a farmer herd his Yakows into his fence to finding one in a secret room that can only accessed with the correct Eco (the games version of power-ups). There are about one-hundred Power Cells in the game. Precursor Orbs are far more abundant (there are two-thousand of these suckers) and are a currency used in the game to obtain Power Cells off of certain characters in the game. Scout Flies are artificial scouting creatures created by one of the protagonists who help them throughout the game. They have been trapped and there are exactly seven in each level; finding all seven will yield one of the many Power Cells. Basically, the characters use these Power Cells to power zoomers (similar to the ones in Return of the Jedi) and cross deadly lava pits or canyons. These are necessary to progress throughout the game. Those are the collectibles of the game, so lets get down to the gameplay.

Gameplay:
 The gameplay is obviously one of the biggest reasons someone may want to play this game. Let me just say, it doesnt disappoint. Being a platforming game, one of the most important functions of the game is the ability to not only jump, but to be able to do it with ease and grace, while still making the player feel in control. It mostly succeeds in that goal. There were a few times when I felt I jumped correctly, but the landing wasn't where I expected it to be, however, those instances were rare and they don't detract from the game. Playing as Jak is also one of the smoothest game experiences ever; he moves so easily and stops as soon as I let go of the analog stick. The game has very responsive controls, to be blunt about it.

 For the mission objectives, they are varied and done with style. One mission had me get ambushed by Lurkers, the main enemy group of the game, while another had me try to defeat a giant, evil plant. Those are the action goals. Others are more platforming focused, such as climbing a huge underground site, with several obstacles and poles to swing from. There are also several minigames, all of which are fun and engaging. One of these minigames had me catching two-hundred pounds of fish for a local fisherman, and it made me focus, but it wasn't frustrating. Another gameplay mechanic is the zoomer and Flut-Flut. The former is what it sounds like and it controls pretty well, but it isn't the best to handle, but that adds to the feel. The Flut-Flut, on the other hand, is a giant, bird-like creature that Jak rides in a similar manner to how Mario rides Yoshi; the bird even has a flutter jump. The bird is probably my favorite aspect of the game, gameplay-wise. It, like Jak, controls very well and it also isn't overused, so it was a treat for the few times I got to use it. Jak must, however, have to complete a certain mission before using it.

 Eco is the games versions of power-ups. They grant Jak temporary powers that can be used to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, and just be awesome. Green Eco heals Jak, Blue Eco gives him speed and access to open/activate certain areas of the game, Yellow Eco allows him to shoot fiery Eco blasts, and Red Eco makes Jak stronger. These different types of Eco are used throughout the game to help Jak on his quest and are really fun to use. As a side note, Dark Eco is bad.

 Despite my almost-complete positive outlook on the gameplay so far, it isn't perfect. As stated above, the jumps don't quite work always, but I feel that way with all platformers, so that may be me and not the game. Also, the camera doesnt always line up correctly, so a few jumps may get missed due to that reason. This next reason isn't really a complaint, but just something that needs to be said: the game doesnt add much new to the platforming category, but just refines several of its attributes.

 There are two ideas that were implemented into the game that, although not noticeable at first, make a huge difference when another game is played. The first idea is that there is almost zero loading. The game has very, very brief loading when the game data is saved and loaded, but that is it. There is no loading between levels, although there are a couple levels that are up a mountain or across water and requires slight waiting. Other than those couple instances, there is no loading. It is a beauty to be able to travel through a seamless, connected world. The game really is just one, big level. It may seem trivial, but the next time that another game is played, Ill remember. There are also warp gates to travel to a previous home-area (they have no enemies and are in the middle of the action levels, as I call them), so the player doesnt have to find a way all the way back.

 The other idea is that when Jak dies, your Ottsel friend, Daxter, says a hilarious comment. These can range from How am I gonna get changed back now! to Hey, Jak! Can I have your insect collection? There are probably a good fifteen of these death scenes and they are extremely funny and can lighten the mood if it felt like a cheap death. Also, whenever Jak gets a Power Cell, Daxter does a funky dance and these are nice to see. There are probably fifteen of these, too.

 Overall, the gameplay is exemplary and does a magnificent job of keeping true to the formula of 3D platformers. It may not be new, but the refinement level is top-notch.

Story:
 The story doesnt get into much detail (most platformers dont), but it has hilarious moments thanks to the character interaction. Daxter is probably one of the funniest video game characters that I have ever seen, and most of the funny scenes involve him in some way. What the game doesnt have in story, it makes up for with witty character dialogue.

Design:
 The worlds are designed in one the most amazing ways possible. This is a living, breathing world. It also shows what the PS2 is truly capable of doing with graphics. These are probably some of the best graphics out there on any video game console, as of 2001.

Sound:
 The sound effects are pleasing to hear and the music is very well done. The music that plays when Jak receives a Power Cell lets the player know that he or she just accomplished something. The level music is also very relatable to the level itself. Im not a music expert, but when I see a green and brightly colored land, I think happy. The game executes music sounding like what a level looks like very well.

Difficulty:
 One of the major qualms that some people may have with the game, is the difficulty. To most people, they would probably find it to be exceptionally easy, especially if they have played several 3D platformers and have become very adept. I didn't have a problem with it, because I felt it fit with the game. It is a very relaxing experience and although platformer masters may not find it appealing, they would be foolish to ignore the game because of that.

Replay Value:
 This is the heart-breaker of the deal. The game is very short. The game could be beaten in less than six hours. I fully beat it in about ten hours and wasn't rushing nor taking in every little detail to the game. I do recommend replaying the game not only because it is great, but because I feel that it would be good for speed-runs, even if that wasn't an intention. It is easy enough for most gamers and could pose a challenge for masters who want extremely fast times. For those who aren't interested, it is still more than worthy for a single playthrough.

Final Judgment:
 This game is RECOMMENDED. Although there are a few gameplay mechanics that irk me at times, they don't detract from the overall experience. It is a short game, but amusement can be found in replaying for speed runs or just because it is enjoyable and downright funny. At the very least, the game should be rented and played through once. Then, a decision can be made on whether it should be bought. I, personally, am happy that what feels like an end to the 3D platforming age is going out with a very high-quality game.

As a long time 'Tales of' fan I felt devastated that the series was never going to make another landing in the west after Vesperia, until the releases of the mediocre 'Graces f' that actually helped the series continue in the west. After a few disappointing releases I was stoked to hear about Zestiria back when it was announced late 2012 when I was sitting in my Marine Biology class. I couldn't wait for this fresh new entry that was going to be ""open world""

I was disappointed by the time I got the game moreso cause it wasn't structured like any of the stellar Tales games I've played notably Abyss & Vesperia, the combat was fine but the rest of the game just felt lazily slopped together. Skits were clumped to save points and it made watching them feel like a waste of your own time and the story never had a striking pivotal moment that most JRPGs do.  The story laid flat on the ground hours after hours and not only that but the characters were never intriguing or held my interest. I gave up on Zestiria after the game made me obligated to backtrack to places for no real reason.

This had to be the most lackluster entry in the series since 'Graces f' and I was extremely disappointed that this game had a Tales name to it and the massive amount of filler content to extend an already short game.

When you take it out of the box it looks massive, but it is well designed and your hand falls naturally into the groves on the top and sides, making it feel smaller in your hand.  In the past when I tried using a big mouse, I had discomfort in my wrist.  For that reason I have long been using a small mouse, travel size, but so far I am comfortable using this mouse.

The buttons on the left side enable you to quickly go back or forward a page, controls my small mouse does not have.  This speeds up surfing. Also, you can easily adjust the sensitivity of the cursor by pressing the DPI button.  There are 5 options:  1000, 1600, 2400, 3200 and 5500.  I am using 3200.  1000 and 1600 seem slow, sluggish, while at 5500 the cursor flies around too fast for my  liking.  The ability to adjust the DPI is also something I have not had on my small mouse so I didn't know what I was missing.

The scroll wheel works well

This mouse is corded, plugged into a USB port on my laptop.  It has been a very long time since I last used a corded mouse, but the cord for this mouse is so long, about 4.5 feet, that you are not restricted  at all.  I forget that it is corded when I am using it.

The mouse is plug and play.  I plugged it in before turning on my computer and it was immediately recognized.  It was ready to use by the time the computer was fully loaded.  There is no software to install and you can't program the buttons.  This may be a problem for some gamers, but should not be a problem for most surfers.

And it brightens up my desk with the flashing colors, something else my small mouse didn't do. You can pick your color from the 5 that flash and have it continue to flash that color, or you can have random flashing colors.  I tried a single color, but went back to random flashing colors because I found that more interesting.

Simple instructions come with the mouse.

I was sent a sample to try and review, but the fact that I didn't pay for the mouse did not influence this review in any way.  It is a good mouse at a very good price (at the time this review is written).",A Good Surfing Mouse,1431820800,,,

But I played the second at friends' houses and borrowed it once.  Thought it was pretty great and lots of fun.  But the first I owned was Rock Band with Guitar Hero 3.  And Rock Band really did it for me.  The blaring colors of Guitar Hero were replaced by mellower tones that focused more on the music.  And rather than generic rockers you could make your own guy, which I had fun with.  What finally got me to quit playing it so much was... I started to run out of songs.  I still had some favorites I'd play: Welcome Home, Reptilia, The Hand That Feeds, Afterlife (downloaded), Black Hole Sun.  But other than that there wasn't much left to do.  Other than go through on the drums (boring) or five-star everything on Expert (not interested).

And then here's Rock Band 2.  Basically it's the same thing, but without any of the problems from the first one.  There's new songs and quite a lot of them.  You can make all the characters in your band and play through tour mode with a single player.  Some album information is even given when selecting songs from the list.  And it's still the same great fake guitar playing I loved.

But what really clinched Rock Band for me (and the Guitar Hero games as well) was that it opened up to me so much music...  So many artists that I'd heard of or had heard a few seconds' worth of songs from, but ones I never could give a chance.  A lot of good music is represented here, forcing me to expand my horizons and really get into some stuff I should have liked already.

To sum it up, if you liked the original Rock Band or any of the Guitar Hero games, this is a given.  If you're new to the franchises, this is a fine place to start.

(But you may want to use a Guitar Hero controller if possible.  The puff of the strummer on the Rock Band model doesn't have a very good return spring, so you kind of have to hammer it on those faster songs.  The Guitar Hero controller has a more noticeable click and a fast response so I prefer it.

But let me just say this - if you play in skirmish mode (open maps vs. the computer) - you're probably not going to be able to win anything above easy - because the computer cheats.

And even in the easy mode - the computer doesn't seem to have to follow the same resource rules that you do.

Case in point - I had gotten the computer down to one low ammo resource point - yet it was able to have an unending supply of tanks come in from off screen.

And, as somebody else mentioned - when you start the round, and you only have enough resources for a couple of rifle squads, the computer has already gone through the upgrade tree - and has top of the line tanks.

Personally, I think it's just laziness on the part of Relic to have to resort to the computer cheating in order to create levels of difficulty.

And, as others have mentioned - your unit AI isn't exactly that smart either. You order a unit to attack an enemy unit - and half the time, you unit runs right up to the enemy and starts shooting at them - instead of finding a good spot (or even attacking from where they were when you told them to attack).

The gameplay is tight and fluid, and highly rewarding. The graphics are above average; the sound design is spectacular. You won't find better value in a video game than Fallout 3.

I'm going to start this review by saying that I will NOT be comparing Fallout 3 to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. While similarities are definitely present, this game trumps Oblivion in every aspect. The only true similarities exist in game engine and developer.

While Fallout 3 may look like a shooter at first (given the perspective and gun wielding nature of the game), it is far from it. Fallout 3 is a 1st/3rd person Action RPG, which means everything you do in the game are based on your stats. Firing a gun and hitting a target is all based on number calculations based on the specific target and your own stats. Many times you will find yourself aiming directly at a target and missing even though your targeting ridicule is directly placed in an enemies face (at a lower level). This may not attract fans of FPSs, so if you play this game expecting an FPS like experience, you will be disappointed until you raise your shooting-based skills. If you play this game like an RPG, the combat is never a bother and actually feels refreshing with all of the turn-based RPGs in today's market.

If you don't know anything about the concept of the game, you may want to read the synopsis/product details on the top of the page, as it pretty much describes the premise of the game. The atmosphere the game provides is incredible, and can be very convincing. The attention to detail in terms of graphics, sound, level/environment design, and even individual object placement will really immerse you in the experience.

Here are the Pros and Cons I have found with this game:

Pros:
- Level of Detail is incredible
- Excellent and convincing voicework/writing
- Amount of content
- Replayability/Multiple Playthroughs Encouraged
- Satisfying combat
- Decisions made really effect the game
- Excellent story
- Highly addicting
- DLC available to extend an already huge experience

Cons
- Some graphical bugs
- Animations (mostly movement) can look strange
- 3rd person view is awful (only use to peek around corners/see what's behind you)
- Highly addicting, can consume several hours of your life

3.0,False,"07 18, 2011",A2996NCI3BJ325,B0047THYWC,Dansgaming,"Let me start by saying that Dragon Age 2 is not a bad game it's just an average game. The problem is when I think of Bioware and RPGs I don't think of average I think of the best. Dragon Age 2 was such a crushing disappointment for many people out there that were in love with Dragon Age: Origins. Most everything that made Origins grand and epic was removed, changed, or gutted in order to shorten the development time needed. Not every change was bad like making combat much more fun for archers and melee characters. Not all removals were bad either like the removal of skill trees which were never very important anyways. I can see what Bioware was trying to do with the game to make it more fun to a larger audience by improving the combat, but the game suffered so much more in other areas.

Origins starts you off on your journey in the race and origin story that does a great job of bring the main plot directly to you very early in the game. You start with knowing who/what your enemy is and then everything from that moment on (including all main sub missions) is directly and clearly related to your struggle against your foe. Dragon Age 2 unfortunately does not give you this sense of purpose. After 15+ Hours of the game I still had no enemy to point to and I couldn't even begin to tell you what the main story was in this game. The game is structured around a bunch of side missions that get extremely repetitive due to the repeating environments and feeling of why am I doing this? When the main story segments kick in they are far too short and far too spread out that they feel like teases. Not until the final hours of the game do you finally get that sense of purpose and a clear enemy. But even then it's far too late and once again over too fast.

'One of the aspects of Origins that was most loved by fans of the original was the sheer amount of depth that the characters had. You could walk up to a character in your camp and engage in some of the most engaging and delightful conversation in gaming history. Each character had a wealth of history and stories to tell. Dragon Age 2 removes this almost completely making the characters speak only when they absolutely must. The characters in DA2 are each unique and well voice acted, but they just don't feel as alive and it's hard to feel as connected to them.

Repeating environments is perhaps the single thing that I disliked most in DA2. There are hundreds of missions in DA2 but each one takes place in one of 5 environments: Cave, Coast, Warehouse, Mountain Area, Street Alley. Let me clarify, I don't mean just a cave or just a warehouse, I mean the exact same warehouse, cave, etc. every time. You go back to the exact same environment for a slightly different quest dozens of times. Not only does do the environments take away from any form of immersion, it makes each quest feel as repetitive as the next since the spawn points are mostly the exact same in each mission. Not to mention the entirety of the game takes place in one lifeless, boring city that had almost no feeling of immersion.

In origins, there were five or so lengthy main story missions that each had a purpose tied to the main plot, unique feel to them, and specially designed environments for each of these missions. When you went on one of these missions, you knew why it was important and how it affects the main story line. Dragon Age 2 decided to throw this concept out the window. Dragon Age 2 took me about 36 hours to finish doing most every mission. 30 of those hours take place in the same city, connected to the same repeating environments doing side missions that I had no idea what purpose they were for.

Not all of DA2 is doom and gloom. This game does have Bioware's quality voice acting and during what little main story there is, there are some very intense and exciting moments that save this game from being a flop. The main story is written well and complex but takes far too long to develop and is drowned out by the annoying constant side quests. The combat can be a bit repetitive at times, but is a lot faster paced and can be quite fun if you are a fan of action RPGs like Diablo. I recommend playing through this title at least once, but wait for it to hit the clearance bins.

Batman Arkham City is basically Arkham Asylum in a sand box setting. It is a great idea but it did not maintain the impact that Arkham Asylum had. The objectives just didn't connect well together for a complete goal. I felt I was wondering from one objective to the next without a real sense of purpose. Everything I did felt like a gimmick to connect me to the next supervillain fight. Also, you start with most of your gadgets from the beginning of the game. Normally this would be a good feature but you do not get many new gadgets throughout the game. There isn't a slow build up of feeling increasingly more powerful. The length is also an issue.

I have not had one problem with them during that time.  The reason I'm writing this review is because recently I ordered 'No Man's Sky' and I wanted to upgrade my headphones.  Felt I had used them long enough.  I researched headphones for over a week and finally nailed it down to the Playstation Gold Wireless.  They amped those things up to be killer surround and sound quality in general.

I got them last night and hooked them up and sure enough they sounded good.  Although, I was really curious to compare the Gold Wireless Headphones to the X12's.  SO, during a 2 hour play session I switched back and forth in different moments of the game.  Least to say I was blown away.  I was blown away at how GOOD the X12's sound.  The Gold Wireless did not pump out any bass (Even after I tweaked the bass in the settings via the Playstation) and the virtual surround was okay.  To my shock, the X12's pumped bass and actually rivaled the surround sound the Gold Wireless Headphones produced.  NO frickin joke!

Seriously, I immediately took the GOLD wireless phones downstairs, packed them back in the box, put them back in the shipping box, taped it up and requested a refund on Amazon and UPS picked them up the next day.

SO i'm sitting here looking at my X12's and debating whether I purchase a new set of X12's or upgrade to a better Turtle Beach set only because after this  I'm confident Turtle Beach is going to produce the same quality sound in their headphones as the X12's.

SO if your on the fence about these X12's, get them.  It's worth the $40 bucks.  These kicked a $100 headphone in the butt.  ALSO, in case you didn't know, you can easily hook these up to a PS4 using Toslink and a mic wire specifically made for X12 to PS4.

If you want to know how shoot me a reply and I'll explain what I did.  These headphones aren't only for just Xbox.",These headphones kicked the Sony Gold Wireless butt!  Coming from someone who's had the X12's for 5 years.,1470787200,,{'Color:': ' Black'},

The port of an amazing experience, a game for those who enjoy story and depth over franchises that have become products over the years. No third person shooting, a true gem that stands apart from other games in the same genre. Rent it, buy it, steal it... something I really enjoy and I hope others give a try.

1.0,False,"05 17, 2006",A1C5YC4CY33Y1T,B000BC38LA,B. G. Rufleth,"All I can say is ""don't bother.""  It seems to me to be the perfect example of form overshadowing function.  The function of a game is to amuse the player.  Oblivion looks pretty good.  Water, trees, the sky, weather, etc are all rendered quite nicely.  The world seems quite large and there are lots of people around who greet you when you're near and keep a schedule which includes sleeping at night etc.  (This can be annoying when you are trying to talk to an NPC who's locked in their bedroom at night though.)

The game lacks a key feature though.  Namely, fun.  RPGs are fun because you get to explore and solve battles all the while gaining power and gear.  A good story is nice too.  Oblivion has you walking around fighting such interesting creatures as ""wolf"" and ""bandit.""  In fact, you're lucky if you happen on much of anything to battle with and most of my time was spent walking from one location to another.  After a few hours of this I looked up the cheats and fast forward to the end of the game and while the monsters get a little more interesting they still lack anything special except maybe pretty ""graffix.""  As a previous reviewer pointed out, the monsters level with you.  So while walking around you will come upon ""ogre"" who are a royal pain to deal with and drop such exciting things as ""ogre teeth.""

I had to restart because after playing for a couple hours I came to the conclusion that the game is horribly ill setup for a magic using character.  Spells can be ""hotkeyed"" to numbers but only a max of eight items or spells can be hotkeyed.  Using a spell requires hitting the appropriate hotkey, targeting the enemy as if you were playing a FPS, and then hitting the ""x"" key.  Oh and you can't switch spells while being hit so using combinations is more or less out of the question.  So I switched to a warrior character and discovered using the cheats that they expect you to do combinations and special attacks using mouse gestures and different clicks.  Am I playing an RPG or am I trying to play Street Fighter II Turbo with a mouse?

I understand if you liked Morrowind maybe this sounds appealing to you.  I do not like the first person view and the third person camera movement and feel is all wrong.  The battle mechanics make this game about as much a FPS as an RPG.  Oblivion goes beyond just being an ""action rpg"" as far as that goes.  NPCs will sometimes ""assist"" in battles and tend to get right in between you and the monsters and absorb your attacks.  This becomes painfully annoying with tougher monsters.

The character models looked okay but they were still just odd looking dolls and it actually made me appreciate the cartoonish WoW graphics more.  This is with the graphics set to Ultra High.

The inventory, spells lists, etc are poorly setup and look unfinished and out of place.  The whole experience made me want to go back and play an RPG on the SNES.

Some people have discussed Oblivion being a replacement for WoW.  Frankly, I really can't see this.  WoW is actually much more polished than Oblivion and while the graphics might not scream for attention like those in Oblivion the attempt at ultra realism in Oblivion fails in my opinion.

In short, lack of originality, leveling monsters, down right stupid battle mechanics, and very slow game play make Oblivion a poor source of entertainment.","Pretty Face, Hollow and Joyless Center",1147824000,22,,

I have played Galaxies for almost 2 years now, and yes it never felt like a Star Wars game, I played it more like a fantasy game set in the future, or as many called it Everquest with a Star Wars skin, I mean people were mainly battling with swords and warhammers (power hammers) and the armor they mainly used was called composite, it looked like a cross between a Cylon Centurion and Robocop.

Galaxies has never been a runaway hit, and you would think with the Star Wars name it would be, but like I stated before, it never had a Star Wars feel enough to get Star Wars fans, SOE/LA tried gimmicks like telling players how to become a Jedi,then many of the player base were grinding Jedi, but still didn't get any new customers with their ""BE A JEDI"" campaigns..

The tried a combat revamp several months ago and released the total expansion, which again failed to bring in many new customers, so now the starter kit and the NGE (New Game Enhancments),to make the game more ""Star Warsy"", the combat is a first person shooter type format ala Battlefront, and the took away almost all the old professions from over 30 to 9, based on Star Wars characters, with pics and everything.

But asided from some new quests that in the beginning to make new players feel the game is more like Star Wars, the truth is once those are done, the game is pretty much the same as it always was, just very difficult to reach higher levels, and if you don't have the trials of obi-wan expansion, very difficult, the game still has a lot of bugs, weapons are all pretty much the same now, some professions like trader and entertainer or all but useless, it feels like this new combat system was rushed out the door, just like the older one, because they need new customers to keep the game from dying.

In all honestly instead of changing the game every 6 months, and totally destroying everything many players worked for for months and even years, they should have cut their losses and tried Star Wars Galaxies 2, instead of remaking the old game, which still had many bugs and problems that needed to be fixed, and put in something new which caused even more bugs, and broke things that once was fixed.

...Boy was I ever wrong.

WoW has to be the greatest MMORPG ever created. It's not just some cookie-cutter MMORPG with a Warcraft license on it, this game actually rocks! The gameplay is fun and easy to get into, and the interface is just right, so you don't end up getting only half the screen to see through.*Cough*Cough*City of Heroes...

In the game the combat and gameplay is just right to interest people that play in different styles. With the choice of 8 races and 9 classes there is a lot of variety here. That and every race starts in a different spot. (Excluding Gnomes/Dwarves and Orcs/Trolls who start out in the same areas.) The gameplay keeps people interested, and it's perfect for those who don't exactly have the greatest hand-eye coordination in the world. The combat requires strategy and planning to win, it's not often you'll see someone rush headlong into a group of enemies, because if that happened, that person would be on the ground in a matter of seconds.

There's even a variety in servers that you want to be in with 3 different types:

RP: For all those that want to roleplay a personality and not often be bothered by whiny players who ruin the experience.

PVP: This type of server relies strongly on raiding the enemies' areas and defeating the other's side for territory.

Normal: Just a normal server with no strict rules like on RP or a bloodthirsty community like on PVP.

The controls in the game are also well mapped and very smooth, and there is almost no lag where the framerate gets all choppy and bogs down.(I've not seen much except for the dwarven/gnome capital of Ironforge which is a center of commerce and gets lots of players for trade.)

Plus, in this game, it's not required that you group up, even though it makes accomplishing things more efficient. Even a priest doesn't have to group up.(Which, in my opinion, is the least combat-oriented class.) Grouping up is fun, but soloing can be a great experience too.

The audio in the game is particularly good, and character animations are smooth, if you parry a blow, you hear and see it.

The game is also very deep with a wide variety of weapons and trade skills. The classes are organized well and one is never exactly the same as another. They all have some special something that works just for them.

The visuals are clean and will not disappoint players of other Warcraft games, it has the ""cartoonish"" style that players will recognize and remember.

Now to the cons. Well, the cons... the cons.... the cons... there uh, are none, imagine that.

This game takes the genre defined by: ""Killing things just to get some experience."" and takes it to the next level. Buy this game, it's worth the $15 a month, better than SWG, better than CoH, buy it now. Overall, it's an excellent game and the greatest MMORPG on the Market.",The Greatest MMORPG on the Market,1108771200,9,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Moon,"OK, I've given this game a few days of intensive playing and must admit that it says something when you've had such high expectations for a game  and it lives up to it!  Somehow Capcom has managed to take their best game  from the 80's (and probably their first truly great game) and convert it  into a game that will impress game players of today.  And surely the old  platform jumpers and side-scrollers need this sort of rejuvenation.
As to  the game itself: long time Strider fans will find all the old moves here  along with a few new ones--namely dashing, a double jump, a special wall  jump and now an aerial down-up move (not unlike the special moves in other  Capcom side-scrollers, but here limited toan air attack.)  The speed is  obviously upped a few notches and the graphics are far improved, however  this does not fully explain what makes Strider so amazing.
The truly new  innovation here are the 3-D environments you move about in, while still  being true to a 2-D game.  These aren't just pretty 3-D rendered  backgrounds.  This is most noticable if you play the other Strider (Hien),  who will often throw his projectiles off at guards far off in the  background--guards who can also take pot-shots at you.  Add to this that  the environments are often breath taking and amazingly creative and you  have a game that will bring back players over and over again (take for  example the awesome ice-crawling opening to level 3.)
As far as  length...this has been the point I've heard over and over again and dreaded  that we'd have another 20 minute Strider game.  Not true.  If you play  through the whole game (including level 0) it does take about an hour.  Of  course you'll want to improve that and you'll want to master the game so  that you arn't getting killed all the time.  Perhaps this needs a 5  continue limit for the people who are just going to plough through it and  never play it again.  There is definitely an incentive to beat each level  without continuing (and this is not an easy task--even the fairly easy  first level will not be beaten flawlessly without some skill and quick  reflexes.  Also, each level is littered with bonus items, giving good  reason to explore every nook and cranny of the game.  I am amazed over and  over how many places I keep discovering.
Ultimately this game has a lot  of replay value but only if you are the sort of person who likes to master  a game and not just get to the end.  Strider 2 is all about super-cool  environments and a super-cool hero with action sequences that never fail to  deliver.  More so, most everything here can be gotten around without  getting hit at all (for instance--the mine scene can be done without  getting hit once though it will require exploration, experimentation and  creativity.  Thus, for those who still love this sort of game, Strider 2 is  both an excellent return to form and a perfect utilization of the improved  technology/programming.
I should also add that Strider 1 has been  included on the bonus disc, and while this may just be too primitive for  some people, to my sensibilities this remains one of the defining games of  this genre and seems to hold up pretty well to its eleven year  hibernation.
All in all, this is a must purchase for Capcom fans and fans  of arcade style action games.",Strider Hiryu returns in excellent sequel--finally!,964915200,,,

It was a completely brilliant idea that was executed very well, but did leave some room for improvement. Well, most of that room has now been filled.

The big one is loading times. That was the original game's major flaw. It seemed as though I spent almost as much time watching the loading icon as I did playing the guitar. The improvement here is very noticeable. Whatever they did to fix the problem worked like a charm.

There are still a few places where the game doesn't seem to register the notes entirely accurately -- there have been times when looping through song sections where it clearly missed an error or mistakenly registered one. However, it does seem a bit more accurate than the original game, and it's not that common. The trick is to understand that it's going to happen and play through it.

One thing that's only relevant to us early adopters of the first game is the inclusion from day one of the bass edition . The original game did not originally come with bass play, which was later offered as a fairly expensive ($30) add-on. Although bass is not mentioned on the front of the case, it is included. When you first run the game, it asks you to select one of three learning tracks: lead guitar, rhythm guitar, or bass. You can also change the track at any time.

The learning guidance is also clearer and easier to use. The game tracks your progress and offers a handful of activities to choose from. One that's new is looping song sections. The section is offered at slow speed and low difficulty level (fewer notes per measure), and is repeated with an increase in one or the other until you're playing every note at full speed. At that point the rest of the song plays out. Looping sections was in the original game, but had to be selected manually and was not as dynamic.

The song list in the new game trends more to classic rock and metal than the original game. I like it; your mileage may vary. The original game's songs can be ""imported"" into the new game for a $10 fee. I find this kind of annoying, but that's how these things work these days.

There is one thing that I wish they would have added to the new version, and that's in-game player profiles. As with the first Rocksmith, it simply uses the currently active Playstation profile to track one's progress. So if there are multiple players in your house, you have to exit the game completely, switch user profiles, and restart to change to another player's in-game profile. This is a major hassle.

Overall, though, there is little to dislike about Rocksmith 2014. If you are an absolute beginner, you ideally should find someone to show you the basics, since the game can't really offer feedback on things like fingering and pick technique. But once you're a little comfortable with the instrument, it'll keep you practicing and improving. Absolutely recommended.",A major improvement on an already brilliant game/ practice tool,1386547200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Too Human is a very addictive action RPG.  In fact, you don't even realize it's full potential until at least one full play-through of the game, which is probably why it recieved many negative reviews.

Combat is fun and addictive.  The action elements are just really enjoyable.
The skill trees are very well thought out.
Loot system is very involved.
Co-op is really cool and there is rumor it will be updated to 4 player.
Cool characters and the story is awesome.
Levels are nicely designed.
Replay value is very high!

It is not without its fault as the camera could have used a bit more refinement.  As could the inventory UI.

I personally enjoy using the gamepad controller. If your used to playing COD on Xbox 360 (like me) or on PS3. It does take a few minutes to get used to playing it w/ the gamepad controller. But you get the hang of it with in a few minutes. You can even use the last gen Wii controllers for playing if you like? The graphics on Wii U's Ghost is awesome!

It's definitely a love/hate relationship for me! I'd actually bought this game back around 1999 or 2000 when I got my first PS2. I started playing and at first, while it was so scary it gave me goosebumps, it was also exciting to keep discovering items and progressing. I was able to continue for a while. It's not gory in anyway-you're essentially investigating a case in a haunted mansion equipped only with a special camera to see/battle/capture spirits or take photos of clues the naked eye can't fully detect-something might just look a little ""odd"" so you snap a photo-sometimes it's a clue-like a hidden doorway or puzzle piece, sometimes it's nothing and you've wasted precious film. As you explore, the ""spirit sensor"" light might start to glow, meaning there's a spirit nearby. With the rumble pack throbbing to your increased heartbeat, you might often get attacked from behind or in some cases, as you're frantically looking around through the view finder (the only way to see the spirits), you're being attacked near your feet. Anyway, I only got a little way into the game and was too scared to continue, traded it in. A few years later, I was totally in the mood for a different kind of game, THIS kind of game. Bought it, started playing it and almost got to the same place and quit once again, gave the game away to a friend. Finally, about 6 months ago, I once again felt like playing it, bought it and yes, shortly after reaching the same place (completely prepared for everything up to that point), I again got too frightened to keep playing. A friend of mine bought the release after this, which I also played, not nearly as scary for some reason. I like that it is a scary/adventure game, with ghosts and such, but not gory, in spite of the plot line.","This classic PS2 first person adventure game WILL scare the heck out of ANYONE, without gore!!",1417824000,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

Yep, I'm a Civirgin, and one of the people that Civ Rev was designed for - the uninitiated console gamer. And as a fan of turn-based strategy games, let me say that this game is a highly addictive funnel which will suck away hours of your life as you battle and build your mighty empire.

Playing one of 16 civilizations, you'll be tossed onto a randomly generated map with four other leaders where you found your capital city and begin your quest for victory. Winning is possible in four different categories: Domination, Technology, Economic, or Cultural. Upon founding your city, your workers will start to harvest the raw materials to begin producing units and buildings. Units are mostly military in nature, and designed for offensive or defensive purposes, depending on what sort of victory you're going for. Buildings are used to enhance your city and push it in one of several directions, making it a production or cultural powerhouse that also reaps gold or scientific knowledge to advance your technology.

Which brings us to the Tech Tree, obviously important for a technological victory, but vitally important for the others as well. Initially your starting civ will have the ability to learn only four technologies - Alphabet, Bronze Working, Horseback Riding, or Pottery. An advisor instructs you as to the benefits and uses of each technology, letting you know if it's primarily for cultural, scientific or military use. Learning a tech unlocks further techs, taking you from archers and warriors to modern infantry, tanks, battle ships and bombers. The handy Tech Tree - showing all techs and what is needed to unlock them - is available to view at any time, so you can plot what to research on your road to glory. Being the first to research a tech before other civs usually offers a bonus, such as a free unit or city enhancement.

The game then becomes a balancing act. Focus too much on one area, such as military production at the expense of culture, and watch as your cities begin to ""flip"" to civs with higher culture. Focus too much on infastructure without building defense and your neighbors will roll over you. In essence, this forces you to really think about what your next move should be and deepens the game play. Which, of course, leads to a ""just one more turn"" approach that has you playing long after you originally planned on quitting. And that's just Single Player mode. Toss in playing against real people over the 'net or a LAN hook-up and, well, kiss your free time goodbye...

All in all, if you enjoy strategy games, you should really enjoy this outing. Kudos to the folks that put this together for dipping their toe into the console market. And as someone untainted by experience with previous PC versions, I have no disillusions over what ""could've"" or ""should've"" been and just enjoy it for what it is.",Unleash the Dogs of Gaming...,1217203200,7,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

To be honest, I am not sure why though.

I was not expecting HD graphics on a Vita version (although I do not believe the PS3/4 versions have any better).
You do not buy these type of games for stunning visuals, but to have yourself challenged and feel rewarded for the time you put into it.

This is not a typical RPG or strategy game, but more of a hybrid.
Combat can be grueling and one mistake on your part can lead to decimation - quickly.
Its rather unforgiving in that realm.

The main concept is chaining attacks and part members together to defeat the almost always sea of monsters that outnumber your at least 3 to 1 (in a good situation).
You can also chain them to defend on another and this is just as essential to the part survival.
You do not get to save until the dungeon/battle is over, but it does save ""checkpoints"" during the battle.
So if you make a mistake, you have start over from a checkpoint, which can be grueling.
It almost forces you to be perfect, which can be OK at times, but just seems punishing in this game.

This is definitely not a game for everyone or for those with little patience.

The RPG system is limited in the amount of upgrades you can give your characters in terms of skills.
Gear has to be found mainly by running the dungeons over and over.

The ""magic"" system costs a very valuable and rare resource that is acquired every time you loot a chest or sell and item, however all spells cast are drained from the same universal pool and cannot be regenerated by ""resting"" or finding an Inn.
This makes you value it much more and be very wise with the use of it.

The challenge factor is definitely present in this game.
This game is definitely a unique idea and was put into practice very well.
The link system seems so simple at first, but can easily become so very complex and confusing.

Overall, for the price this game currently goes for, I would definitely say to a hardcore gamer to give this a shot to experience a very unique style RPG

I bought it ASAP, not expecting a clone of TLJ by any means, just hoping for a good adventure game.
Well, I have yet to finish Syberia and it's been 9 months. The game is breathtakingly beautiful to look at, and obviously designed with care.
But as lovely as the game is to look at, the story is kind of plodding, the voice acting is (frankly) terrible, and the game just has no personality. The player is given little chance to explore environments or make choices -- you simply have to point and click your way through every (often very derivative) puzzle to get to the next point.
One of the things I loved about ""Longest Journey,"" as well as ""Sanitarium,"" ""Grim Fandango"" ""Myst 3"" and the ""Monkey Island Series,"" was the sense that we got the chance to contribute to the story or character's choices and personality. Characters like April and Guybrush really sparkle simply because the game doesn't just want to get you from A to Z, but to help you explore a world and feel part of it. So there are those little extras, like clicking on an object or a character just to enjoy the protagonist's responses to it (""I'm not picking that up!"") and to learn about the character. There's nothing like this in Syberia.
I wish I'd liked it more, and do hope to finish the game someday (I got about 2/3 through before finally giving up in boredom). But it's ironic that the story is about automatons -- the character of Kate is almost as flat and uninteresting as an automaton herself.

GOOD:
- Four-player online (or offline) co-op Gameplay allows two; three, or four players play through the game from start to end. A co-op player can come into the game at any time and leave at any time (note only one of you will play as the Master Chief, while another will play as the Arbiter, and the other two players will be Elites that work with humans)
- Great looking graphics and animation, that look even better then Halo 2, F.E.A.R. and just as good as Bioshock, while these graphics might not look as good as Gears of War do to some people these graphics still are some of the best seen to date.
- Intense multiplayer action online through Xbox Live with matches as small as one on one and as big as 16 players (and offline with out using Xbox Live using either spilt screen, or system link). Halo 3 is set up similar to Halo 2 in the sense that you're given a rank when you play multiplayer (this rank can go up or down at any time) this rank is representative of your skill and your matched with others of your skill type, that way new unskilled players and hardcore veterans will not often play against one another, unless they make a special match themselves that ignores rank.

BAD:
- Confusing plot to new players of this franchise - Playing Pervious games and read the Halo Novels will fill you in on the details, if you are incline to learn them.
- No Clan Support (like in Halo 2) - This might get fixed in a future patch
- Game is considered short to some (Campaign Story Mode).

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:
- A Sci-Fi First Person Shooter with quick pacing and vehicle combat.
- Co-op and online versus/team games is the big draw here.
- NEW MODE: Forge is a mode that lets you edit all the maps in Halo 3, while you cannot rebuild the maps themselves you can in this mode, add and take away any and all of the objects from vehicles and guns to spawning points and flag zones. This is all done in real time and you can invite friends to this mode while your customizing the map(s), they can play a multiplayer game while your doing this (instead of just waiting for you) and if you want you can forgo editing the map and join the game at hand as either a player or the map editor (who looks like 343 Guilty Spark), while playing as the map editor you can still add and take away any and all objects from vehicles and guns to spawning points and flag zones any time you want.
- NEW MODE: Theater Mode is a video editor that lets you record and play back any and all matches from Campaign, Multiplayer, and Forge modes from the point of view of any player either in first person or third person (even in a orbit-cam where the camera circles around the player) all in real time (you can also pause this at any time as well as fast forward and rewind), even use your camera to fly around the match and see the match from any angle you want, Don't forget you must save your videos before you turn off the game or you will lose said videos. Also you can take a picture at any time and save it to your Xbox 360 then download your picture at Bungie.net

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:
- Halo 2 (Xbox)
- Halo (Xbox)
- Resistance: Fall of Man (PS3)
- Bioshock (360)
- Gears of War (360)

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- There are bonus items scattered through the Campaign Story Mode called Skulls getting these ""Skulls"" will make the game harder (by doing things like turning off radar for the rest of the Campaign Mode your playing it) but will also greatly increase your meta game score for the Campaign Mode.
- There are two different limited collectors editions of this game. One is called the limited edition, which comes in a metal tin and has a bonus disc (with behind the scene videos and such) and also comes with an art book. While the other limited edition (called Legendary edition) you will find an art book a mini poster two bonus DVDs (with behind the scene videos and such as well as a collection of all the cut scenes form Halo and Halo 2 and themes you can download to your 360) And the it comes with a plastic Master Chief Helmet to keep your DVDs in (Helmet as big a volley ball).

For the past several months, he has appeared in several great games for Nintendo's Gamecube system. First, he and his friends and enemies wowed us with the thrill of baseball in Mario Superstar Baseball. Next, he tried it again to the beat of Dance Dance Revolution with his own wave of the arcade clasic. Last month, he also scored big with the return of the board game classic in Mario party 7. Now, the turn of the single chant of Soccer strikes, and it happens to be a goal.

Super Mario Strikers for Nintendo's Gamecube is a rock'em, sock'em  sports game, where Mario and friends tackle on the world of soccer. The game is themed with soccer through Nintendo's uniqueness without any loss. In the game, you can choose your captain from Mario or Luigi, to characters like Donkey Kong and Yoshi. The game also features methods of tricking your opponents from scoring a goal with weapons like the koopa shells, electric fences, and banana peels, similar to Mario Power Tennis. The control is a bit complex at first, but it is very easy to pick up with a little practice, and the graphics are really superb for anybody who loves to score a goal. The game also includes some terrific mini-games to help you score and control your characters.

All in all, Super Mario Strikers is a well-recognized soccer game for anybody who owns the Nintendo Gamecube. This is a great purchase for any die hard sports fanatic, or for all of us who have been longtime fans of Mario and company. Considering there haven't really been at all many soccer games for the Nintendo Gamecube, this one scores big.

5.0,True,"03 10, 2012",A12LH2100CKQO,B00140P9BA,God is a refuge for us (Psalms 62:8),"I bought the European/UK EA Value Games edition in the orange case from seller NAYKED APPAREL.  The CD key/ serial key was hard to read (small print, and the V looked like a U), but after I got the code right, it installed fine on my PC running Windows XP SP3.

I downloaded the free Bring Down the Sky (BDTS) downloadable content (DLC), but there was no way to register Mass Effect on Bioware's website or EA's website (and you had to register Mass Effect in order to get the BDTS serial key; but the game is old now, so they no longer accept registration for it).  So, you have to email EA support.  They responded to my request for a BDTS serial key within 2 hours.  I understand that the BDTS serial key is generic, so the same key could be used by many people; however, key activation also depends on EA servers.  If you have a key and it doesn't seem to work, keep trying for a few days.

I also bought Pinnacle Station DLC from the Origin Store for 5 bucks, and it came with the 1.02 patch for Mass Effect.  Pinnacle Station is like a shooting gallery / hologram deck, where you pit your fighting skills against hologram characters.  It's not a true mission like the other missions.

The value edition comes with a second disk. The extra disk is for other European languages; look in the ""data"" folder, and you will find several large .rar files for German, French, and Italian. Unless you select one of those languages during install, you will not be prompted to use the second disk. And the ""eurodocs"" folder contains game manuals for 12 languages, including English.

If you are looking for the English manual, go to the second disk; you will find it in the ""eurodocs"" folder in the sub-folder named ""English"".

So, what about the game itself?  You can read many other reviews for that!  I will say this: It plays like a movie, which is very cool.  Just the right amount of RPG, just the right amount of action, and very good story/plot and character development.  Excellent graphics, voice acting, and cut scenes.

Despite owning hundreds of games since, I still found myself going back to it at least once a month to try to beat it in some way more fantastic than the last. It's the only game I've played so consistently for so long, and probably will remain as much.

This game is excellent. It's so much more involved and detailed than Alpha Centauri, but has so much familiar in it that it felt like home from the very first play attempt. It's a lot harder! I can beat it in the easiest difficulty so far with 1-2 computer opponents, but I've only had it a week and not been able to play each day. I'm sure with practice I'll be dominating some rival factions in no time ;)

For those not familiar with Alpha Centauri or the Sid Meier's/Civilization games.. this is basically a game where you start off with a base and have to build it up with troops, people, research technologies, and expand your faction with more bases. All the while you're navigating the dangerous terrain of an alien world with sometimes hostile wildlife and the even more dangerous waters of diplomatic communication with other factions. Some will be your friends, some will try to destroy you. Your actions and behaviors will determine how they view you, and whether they like or hate you. Your actions will even determine whether the native lifeforms will like you or hate you. Everything is inter-connected, it's great. You have multiple ways to beat the game.. battle domination, technological supremacy, and quite a few more.

Both games were very well done and I really enjoyed storming Omaha Beach, driving the King Tiger Tank, sabotaging the deadly u-boat and destroying the V2 Rocket Plant. Both were great games. So when I saw Medal of Honour: Spearhead, I thought that it would be just as good. Well, I half to say I was a little disappointed. The game has by far the best opening. Its starts out with you as Sgt. Jack Barnes; paratrooper with the 101st. You and a squad are awaiting to be dropped behind enemy lines on D-Day. As you slowly drift down, enemy flak explodes around you, many of your planes are shot down, triple A tracers fly up from the ground,  fellow paratroopers are all around you, and if you watch carefully you can even see one free falling with-out a parachute. When you land, you crash through the roof of a  barn full of German soldiers.  Fallowing this, you'll be whisked away on 9 levels from Normandy to Berlin, where you'll sabotage German artillery, bridges, and you even get to drive a Soviet T34 tank. Here are some of the new tweaks Spearhead adds to the game: you can now lean side to side (helps to peak around corners), you can control the 7.62 mm machine gun on the Soviet tank, you can operate all sorts of artillery, there are a new weapons, there's 12 new multiplayer maps and a new multiplayer ""tug of war"" and  trees now snap into as you bound away at them with the heavy machine guns. What I didn't like about the game is that the expansion was way to short and  made the German soldiers dumber and easier to kill. In Allied Assault, it would take about three rifle shots (in the torso) to take down an opposing soldier. In most of Spearhead, its only a one shot kill. Also the Germans tend to stand around a lot, unaware of your presence even if your raging a battle around them. There are also a number of graphical and sound glitches that kind-of take away from the game. For in stance, when you shoot the Lee Enfield and the Gewehr 43 rifles, there is no sound. You'll here the bullet hit what ever it is you shoot at, but there is no ""bang"" as you push the fire button. I also noticed this problem with the Soviet tank cannon and some of the artillery. I don't know if this is a bug in the game or what, but it didn't happen in MOH:AA.  Graphically, Spearhead is the same as Allied Assault, and the sounds are just as good. What I really liked were the Poems that were read after the completion of each mission. Over all Spearhead offers a fun after noon of fighting, but isn't worth $30. I'm just glade I found the game on a $10 sales rack, other wise I would have felt a little ripped.",a little disappointed.....,1106611200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I purchased a PS3 back in 2011, and it still works as perfectly as the day it was opened.  My PS3 got me through college, and will soon be given to my little brother to get him through college.  So I'm not a stranger to Playstation.  When I graduated I moved in with three housemates who are all PC gamers.  I spent ~$3,000 building a desktop and it. is. amazing.  Made Skyrim on PS3 look like an N64 game.  I was fairly reserved when buying the PS4 because I was so used to top-notch graphics and no loading screens.

The PS4 graphics are just as mind-blowing.  The rendering of shadows, lighting and water in Destiny are so incredible, really, hats off to those responsible for it.

PS4 Review:
Graphics are mindblowingly good
Interface seems much easier to use than the PS3 was
Sleek design.  Slightly annoyed at how small the power button is, and I think it might be touch instead of an actual button.

PS4 Controller:
Nice design, personally I actually liked the PS3 controllers better though.
Some people had been complaining about the joysticks, but I'm at ~40 hours of gameplay and they're still perfect.
Doesn't seem to hold a charge nearly as long as the PS3 controllers, but I have my PS4 set up on my computer desk ~3feet from me so I just keep it plugged in.  I don't have a solid number for you, but if I had to guess I'd say it would only last about 5 or so hours.
The ""headset"" they give you is an uncomfortable earpiece with a mic attached, like you used to see come with phones.  I'm going to try to get my work bluetooth to connect because that's kinda irritating and the earbud hurts and won't stay in my ear.

Destiny Review:
Graphics: 10/10, amazing
Gameplay: 10/10, amazing
Storyline: lolwut
The story is never clear, and they never really explain.  They get around this by characters saying things such as ""I don't have time to explain"" or ""you know the legend yes?"" and Dinklebot will reply ""of course"" before you can even say ""uhh no? Care to tell me what's happening?""  They also tell you to go online to read cards you unlock which explain the story.
Leveling up to 20 was fun and pretty quick, I really enjoyed the missions even if I didn't really know why I was doing stuff.
Strike missions require PSPlus but are definitely worth it, they require 3 people to play and give a lot of experience and are pretty tough.
Crucible (multiplayer pvp) is Halo-like, except that you keep all your guns, armor and moves from singleplayer which is fun and adds a lot of diversity.  It also means the higher level people dominate, but if you're good you can hang, and you get good rewards.  Personally I avoided it until I was level 20 and now I'm doing okay.
Patrol: a mode where you basically have free reign to wander the different locations (Russia, Moon, Venus, Mars), taking mini missions as you see fit and killing enemies for experience.  This is wonderful for leveling up and for taking in the sights!
Leveling past 20 is weird, because it requires leveling up your armor instead of XP bar.  I won't bother getting into details on that though, basically you just need to play a LOT of matches and get better armor to advance.  I'm currently level 23 and still having fun.
Issues:
Story line was over pretty quickly, and I didn't really know what was happening.  For a company capable of such a great story as the Halo series, this was disappointing.
Getting new weapons and armor - this one is the biggest issue people seem to have.
You get something called an ""engram"" which you take to someone to decode.  It has a % chance of giving you an item which is common, uncommon, rare, or legendary.  This is how you get almost all of your items and weapons, which means it's entirely up to chance.  People have played a strike mission, spent a good half hour killing a difficult boss and gotten a Legendary Engram, only to have it pop out a Rare item which is useless to them at that point in the game.  Even the Legendary Engrams only have an okay-ish chance of giving you a legendary item.  Leveling in this manner is a real pain.  For example, I've spent longer going from 20 to 23 than I did going from 1 to 20.

Overall, from a long-time PS3 fan converted to a PC gamer, this bundle was completely worth it.  I am pretty sure I spent ~24 hours a week playing League of Legends on average before purchasing this bundle.  Since then, I haven't signed onto League once, I've been too eager to play Destiny with some of my college friends.

As a side note - Some may ask why I didn't just get Destiny on PS3.  My college roommates, whom I never get to see, both have a PS4 and played Destiny on it.  I wanted to join them, so I basically spent an additional $400 just to get the proper system to play with them.  Still worth it.",PS3/PC gamer review of this bundle.  /all Worth,1412121600,,,

To be a hundred percent honest, the major factor in me wanting a PS4 was to play 'Infamous: Second Son'. And let me tell you, it was totally worth it! The game is a blast! If you liked the other two, and you'll like this one too, but that, my friends, is for a separate review.
First, I will say that I didn't buy thispackage from Amazon. I bought it from a certain specialty store that was running a trade in deal towards the purchase of a PS4. It was either this or the 'Last of Us' bundle, and since I had already played through it on the PS3, I chose this one.
'Destiny' the game itself is what it is. If you're like me and putzed around with it upon first release, there isn't a whole lot more to it. It's mostly cosmetic changes.
The console itself, as far as the paint job, is okay. I'm not sure what all the high praise is about. It seems like a cheap silk screen job on a regular arctic white shell. I personally prefer the original black. I really wish I had gotten myself one of those nice MGS models, but whatever.
The updates are nice. The new model runs much more quietly. The physical buttons on the front are nice. The new hard-drive try is nice too. A bit easier to swap out than before. I put in a 2TB drive before I even powered it on for the first time after realizing from owning the Xbone how paltry 500GB is for the current gaming generation. Most games install something like 15-30GB of data on your drive. Wait till something like a new Elder Scrolls game comes out and they really figure out how to harness the power of these systems. A word of warning though: If you are one of the people who are waiting for the 1TB version to be released, you are much better off getting a 500GB system and slapping your own drive in. From what I understand, the terabyte version will be about $100 more. Even if it's only $50 more, you're better off buying a 2TB drive from good 'ol Amazon for $80-90 and slapping it in. Then you have a 500GB drive to do what you will with and double the memory in your system.
AAnyway, I'm not going to get into the whole debate over which system is better. You can't convince a fanboy of either side that the competition is better. For me, the major catalyst to me buying the Xbone first is the exclusives. The Xbone's just appealed to ME more. That's not true for everyone, I know, but it was for me. I did need 'Infamous: Second Son' though. :-D

I found this to be, however, a very mediocre game that is certainly not worthy of 5-stars but not deserving of a 1-star rating either. I think what you have here are die hard fans of the series either very disappointed (leading to the 1-star reviews) or vigorously defending the RE series (leading to the 5-star reviews).

I've read 50 plus reviews on here and waited until I finished the game before writing this review. I can tell you for a certainty that there are a lot of reviews on here that didn't play enough of the game to justify their review. For example, many people said in their review how you need to beat all 3 campaigns to unlock the Agent Hunt extra. Wrong. You only need to beat one campaign and the Agent Hunt option will unlock.

I beat both the Leon and Chris campaign and played about half of the Jake campaign before I got bored with the game and decided I'm done with it. And unlike RE4 and RE5 which I still have, I'm going to be selling back RE6 which at the time of this writing is already about $20 below the original release price. That's a pretty fast drop 3 weeks after release for an RE game! So clearly many people were disappointed with the game.

I liked the Leon campaign best which was surprising a little as I expected I would like the more action-oriented Chris campaign. But after the 1st chapter of the Leon campaign it was basically all action. What I liked better about the Leon campaign though was that it didn't seem to drag on like the Chris campaign did. The Chris campaign had way too much ""chasing Ada"" in it and felt very repetitive during Chapters 4 and 5.

Everyone has mentioned the overuse of the QTE's and I'm no exception. Hated it! Way too many. However, there were a few new things I did like. Like the new directional feature (the golden arrow accessed via the ""L-2"" button) to show the direction you need to travel, very good implementation for this game. Another cool implementation is being able to shoot while lying on your back - this came in handy several times during battle. However, like many others I too have found the new inventory control feature confusing, though after a few hours of playtime I did finally figure out how it works. I still like the old system better of carrying items in a suitcase, and RE4 did it best I think in that you could upgrade your suitcase to carry more items as the game progressed. However, I see what Capcom was trying to do here by allowing you to access all of your inventory during gameplay rather than having to wait until you finish gameplay and then have access to it. But the implementation of it is awkward and not user-friendly. The key I think is to leave a couple of slots available so that when a battle ensues you can pick-up specialty items like grenade launcher ammo for example, and not have to fumble with your inventory and delete things you don't need. So I think Capcom did make some improvements to this game over the previous RE games, though some of them (like the inventory system) were not well-implemented.

I think what I missed the most were the notes and journals that you could read and collect from RE4 or RE5 - to me this always added great value to the story. Now you are looking for and shooting blue stars that unlock parts of the story. But I think it makes much more sense to find these items and read them during the flow of the game. You should be uncovering these story aspects at the point in the story that it makes sense to learn about them, not an hour or hours later after you stop playing and go back to read what you found. But I know many people don't care about the storyline and just play for the action, which is probably why Capcom made this change. But for me, I replayed RE4 and RE5 just to gain the journals and notes so I could understand more parts of the story, but with RE6 I didn't even bother.

I also don't like the skill system - this is borrowed from several other action games where you can enhance skills and abilities of your character or the game play. I much prefer the old system of collecting money and upgrading my weapons with the money.

When I heard that there would be three campaigns with intertwined stories I thought it was going to be a really well-developed storyline, but what we got was boring, repetitive, and discombobulated. RE4 and RE5 I played on each of those for about one month. Replaying because I was interested in doing so. I played this game for 2 weekends and finished nearly all of it and have no desire to replay any of it.

And hey, to be honest, Sam Fisher can even give old Snake a run for his money, both as a character and in terms of the title's gameplay, and that's not easy to do.
First off, Splinter Cell takes place in the Tom Clancy near future (much nearer now than it was when the game was released) of the fall of 2004. The Georgian president, after reaching power through a bloodless coup, was being investigated by the US. Trouble is, the agent, or agents, doing the snooping have gone missing. Now, as a member of Third Echelon, Sam Fisher must find them, and what they discovered that got them in trouble. And, as is the case with Tom Clancy's universes, there's a whole lot more going on than meets the eye. As Sam, you have to find out what. Sam's getting gray around the temples, but he's more than capable of holding his own, and getting Michael Ironsides for his voice was inspired.
The name of the game here is stealth. And this game won't hold your hand as much as Metal Gear Solid, making it that much more challenging. I could go on and on about the fabulous graphics; the lighting, the animation, the butter-smooth control, and the extraordinary AI. However, I won't. They are all top notch, the AI especially. Sound and sight are what alerts them to your presence, which means light and noise are your enemies. You have to creep around slowly and softly, stick to the shadows, or create your own. Take enemies out one at a time, or pass them by in the darkness like a ghost.
That's really the best thing about this game: total and complete immersion. The world, lives, breathes, and thinks, and you have to stay one step ahead of it. Splinter Cell encourages you, FORCES you, to think like a highly trained covert operative. You must become Sam Fisher, because if you don't, you'll die, a lot. Actually, you'll probably die a lot anyway, but in this game, that's not a problem. In some parts, this thing is unrelenting. Tom Clancy's one-hit-one-kill rules apply here, for both you AND your enemies. However, patience will keep you alive, along with caution, and, most importantly, you have to think like a spy.
And that is what makes this game so great. Sure, there are a couple isolated times when you think that enemies should see you and they don't. Sure there are some times when a little more help from your espionage cohorts would be nice. However, this game is rooted in realism, and it'll stay with you. For example, you know you've been playing the game too much when you walk into your bedroom when the light is off and immediately notice which corner would be best to hide in. Seriously, this game makes you think like a spy that much, and, if you have the patience and skill, it is extrememly freakin' fun.
There's not really much of a downside to this game. Unfortunately, don't expect the amount of action found in titles like Halo, or even Metal Gear Solid. This is about patience, information gathering, and doing it all without leaving a trace. However, if you dig this sort of game, you are doing yourself a disservice by not getting it and enjoying it.","Your Mission, Should You Choose To Accept It. . .",1074729600,2,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

Not that I was against it or anything, I remember playing the first one when it was brand new and it was ok, but I never really got involved in it, and over the years I got into the GTA games and figured whats the point of just racing when GTA offers more and having played breifly the previous Undercover and not being impressed, Well, I was given this game and low and behold... I was hooked in minutes!

Its a simple transition from GTA 5/Online racing to this game. The controls are very much the same and both games seems identical enough to be something where if you enjoy one, you can enjoy the other too. It features a city map that compared to GTA is rather small, but it works for this game and everything is easy to get used to and give you an understanding of how the game works and what you're meant to do.

It features a vast amount of cars, ranging from average everyday ones to super cars to really blow the doors off racers. Bonus points for featuring my favorite, the Lamborghini Countach. Mods and upgrades are easy enough to obtain, but not too easy, they will take practice, and the races do give you a good feel of speed involved. You can take it to the street and work your way through becoming the #1 racer in a top 10 list offline, or join online and compete in various other races against other people. Which surprisingly online still works and has not been shut down so far like many other games that over a year old.

My only gripes with the game is the annoying cops. Sometimes they just come out of nowhere going faster than they should, but it only bothered me in new cars that had not had their ram chasis upgraded yet, so anything that touched me would cause me to crash out, until you make the car stronger.

There are things you can do in the game, but it's mostly just adding up race points to unlock the next pro driver on the top 10 list, or being victorious in races for upgrades. But the thing I like best is that most cars are unlockable from the start. You just need to find them on the map and then they are yours to use whenever you like... none of the grinding races for money to try and afford the good cars.

There is plenty of extra DLC too, but none of it is free, and tho I enjoyed this game a lot, I really don't feel the need to spend the price they ask to unlock an airport area, or another amount of $ to unlock movie cars etc... and the overall price to unlock everything does not seem worth it to me. Maybe if it was 99cents per car you want, I'd consider it, but I guess to each their own when it comes to that stuff.

4.0,False,"10 29, 2011",AUK4AT2RVU0BC,B004PAGJOC,Allordacia,"Lets get a few things out of the way first... The people complaining about the lack of a story in this game are really selling themselves (and the game)short. Dead Island follows the same method that every other zombie game follows: 1. Theres a virus 2. people are zombies 3. somehow your immune 4. grab a gun (or rusty pipe) 5. Start smashing faces 6. Repeat. THATS IT! If your okay with that methodology and approach this as an engrossing rpg experience, your going to make it through with your sanity.

Ive heard a lot of people make comparisons of dead island to games like borderlands and oblivion. If your expecting borderlands your going to be sorely disappointed because DI does not even touch its level of depth or sense of adventure. If your expecting Oblivion your going to get something similar in experience but something not quite as deep. DI (like Oblivion imo) is very slow paced. Dont expect to be grabbing machine guns and showering down hellfire upon troves of the undead because you won't even get your grimy hands on a gun until 1/4 of the way through the main story. 90% of the game you will spend in close combat situations bashing in zombies faces with upgraded blunt instruments and knives. Thats where the actual 'charm' of this game lies, its a very well put together first person melee adventure. You have to expect to spend a lot of time searching for parts to assemble weapons and mastering the jump-kick maneuver to save yourself from sticky situations which there will be a lot of.

Combat is completely fun once you learn how to start stringing together combos for big XP gains and once you master the manual swing controls. The actual combat animations are exactly the same throughout the entire game and do get a little boring after you have sliced off a zombies head for the 900th time. Enemies are a little monotonous as well with there only being 4 or 5 different 'types' of monsters that you will fight over and over again. There are human enemies as well whom are better dealt with using the firearms found later in the game but even they don't offer a lot of extra color to an otherwise black and white zombie filled island.

(This is sounding more negative than I actually intend for it to, I really really do like this game but I want to point out its obvious flaws for the curious)

The landscapes are gorgeous and very lifelike although you will encounter a lot of graphical glitches that leave you scratching your head, my favorite being picking up a box or propane tank and walking to a door will allow you to drop it inside the closed door. Things like that should have been caught by the developers but you can nitpick any game and find annoying 'oopsies' that feel like lazy beta testing. The maps feel large and the areas are pretty well laid out. There are usually plenty of area to explore and lots of hidden items and survivors to find who will give you additional tasks to complete for them (except the sewers... screw the damn sewers!)

Questing is about the same for any RPG style game (go find me three of these, move that thing, shoot that, give me a hug, pet my dog, find my insulin, flush this fetus, kick that, etc.) youve played all these missions before in different games and if you found them fun in those games you will enjoy them here. There is a fair amount of grinding required in the later levels and even though monsters are leveled at the same time as you, you will often find yourself overwhelmed by their numbers if you venture to far out without strong weapons or skills to back you up. Play conservatively and pick up everything to use for parts or sell to the drunks scattered around the map.

The characters are well.. ok, again think zombie movie characters. There like that. Stereotypical, pretty dull and full of annoying catch phrases that will inevitably be said a million+ times. Not a lot of time was spent worrying about what would be (or COULD be) done with the characters or NPC's. It just wasn't a priority for the developers and it shows, but again, who the hell cares? Grab a baseball bat with nails in it and make it rain brains and eyeballs, why else would you play a game like this? Seriously?

Multiplayer is completely pointless unless you know the person you are playing with. The game has a very cool feature that lets you instantly drop in and out of other peoples games and work on quests together, trade items, level up etc. Which is cool in theory, except people seem to jump into your game at inopportune times or you jump into theres and find out they are a much higher level than you and someone ends up not having fun. Stick with people you know because that aspect is a lot of fun.

Ok wrapping this up, The game is a lot of fun even though it is full of annoying and sometimes stupid issues. My only REAL complaint with the game is that there are no boss battles. New monsters are introduced with cutscenes and such but then you kill the one monster and three minutes later find another one to kill. I won't ruin anything, but don't expect much of a climax either. Boss battles would have made this game amazing and why they were left out is nauseating to think about. Hopefully some DLC will add some fun bosses but im seriously doubting it.

So there you go, hopefully that gives you some insight. Dont expect a life changing experience, expect; zombies, blood, knives, bikinis, brains and cheesy one liners.

If you are looking for a RPG where you want a story driven RPG with character development, then you will be VERY disappointed.

I have been playing Legend of Legacy for about 10 hours now and the game basically goes like this....
1. Choose a main character (the computer will randomly select 2 other characters to join you)
2. Chart a map by exploring the different areas of that map
3. Kill monsters endlessly to level up your character's abilities in those areas
4. Sell completed maps to raise money to buy equipment, items and new maps for different areas of the island.
5. Try and guess when your character will unlock new abilities or level up existing ones.
6. Piece together a relative weak story by listening to stones that you find in each area.

This is a pick up and go game and I find enjoyment by exploring the different areas.  I have to actually use my imagination to fill in the gaps in the story, which actually, in this day in age, can seem very lame, but I enjoy it nonetheless.  I find myself trying to get 100% completion on each of my maps, which the game recommends you do anyway, just to get a sense of accomplishment.  It is not the best RPG on the 3DS and can actually be argued for being near the worst, but it has turn based combat and can be addictive to those, like myself, who enjoy endless grinding.

If you are a fan of RPG's then you will get more use out of this game than most.  I bought this on Amazon because it was cheaper than the full retail price.  I played the demo and wanted to experience the full game, without forking over the $40 MSRP.

Overall its addictive, fun and enjoyable to those who like grinding.","Good portable RPG, but not the best,",1454544000,2,,

Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children also received fine reviews. How then, could Dirge of Cerberus be bad? Well.. if it was done like this I guess.

This game is unique to the Final Fantasy world because it is an action game, not the usual RPG. Also, it stars a side character from an earlier game which hasn't been done yet either. However, in this case change isn't good. For starters many of the guns are basically the same thing. Of course there are a few differences, but none really too noticeable. Also, the action just becomes stale after awhile. Sure, the enemies change but it's never anything special. All you really have to do is click the R1 button a few times and they all die. Not to mention, the game designers seemed to try and make it as annoying as possible. There are constant loading and saving in the middle of the game that really bogs down the action. But, even after all these saves mid-mission death takes it's toll. You can run through three parts of a four part mission, waste a bunch of time doing boring gun fighting, and then die. And sometimes when you die, they send you all the way back to the start. ...That sucks.

Still, for fans of Final Fantasy the game does have some redeeming qualities. The CG cutscenes are beautiful and the story of Vincent Valentine is rather interesting. Still, when those cutscenes are just popping up two or three times every mission it can get a little tedious. Not to mention, there are load times between the cut scenes and the action. So, you have to wait through that as well.

It is also good to note, that it is cool to hear voices of the characters from a game from 1997. The music isn't too bad either. But, compared to Final Fantasy games from the past it really isn't anything to write home about. Overall, this game doesn't really last too long if you go through it quickly, like I did. But, after you beat the game there are a bunch of extra missons that you can take on for fun. I would have added more value for that, but Square decided to scratch the online portion of this game. That makes the additional missions mute.

A Final Fantasy fan will probably buy this game regardless of what I say. But, as a fan of the series I'd reccommend just renting it. You can easily play through the game in 5 days, and with no online or anything to make it worth keeping, the replay value isn't great. Dirge of Cerberus delivers on telling a story of a very popular side character, but fails at actually creating a decent shooter.","Why Vincent, why?",1155945600,91,,

I wanted to like this game because at the moment it is the only PS4 game I have. It's fun for a young child in my opinion. The reason I say this is because it is very repetitive. It's one of those games where you defeat all your enemies using the same moves over and over and over again. For kids this may be fun, but for teens and adults it can get boring quite fast. I usually play for only 15 minutes before I set the controller down and call it a night.

I'm a bit disappointed because, as I said, I wanted to like this game. I just have to be honest with myself. Repetition is not fun for long periods of time. You'll get bored quite quickly. Great for a child though.

All of them Trophy-compatible, full HD and everything you remember (except the Metal Gear Online of SubSistence). This is one of the few games that show you 1080 quality.
For the record (No C.o. D. M.W. 2 pun intended), this is the game that made me jump from the PSX simulator for PC to the actual PS2.

For Substance you get almost everything you could remember from the PS2 ver:
-Snake and Raiden playing with sunglasses every now and then
-Everything is the same in the interactive menus/cut-scenes
-The exact game play (excluding that sometimes the R2 and L2 are to be pressed a little harder for the tact-reload)
-Every VR mission (yes ALL OF 'EM and getting that trophy is deemed to be virtually impossible).
-Every special (boss survival, casting theater, etc)
-Snake Tales
-And last but not least, the Previous history, that, if you remember, includes the paper clipping, which upon reading unlocks a story published by a reporter, which in order unlocks the book by Dr. Nastasha Romanenko telling the story of Shadow Moses from her perspective.

Only one thing missing (that I know of, will edit if find something else), Skateboarding, there's no skateboarding in the HD Substance. Besides that, everything else you could remember from the PS2 Substance is here.

For Subsistence is almost the same:
-Again the exact game play (this one with the slight difference in the pressure sensitive ""CIRCLE""  that if you remember, is required precision to grab hold of an enemy and not slit his throat, hard core Subsistence/DualShock 2 users will take a while to empty that cup of knowledge to fill it with Dualshock 3 precision)
-Metal Gear Online is out, and I believe only a handful will miss it (not me for sure)
-Snake Vs Monkey (or whatever it's name was) is also gone, you can get the E Z gun with the alternate method, the hard way.
-The ""Special Conditions"" boss survival (Duel Mode I believe it was) is gone too (although you get the DPM camo from the get-go)
-The Nightmare sequence (the one you get when Para-Medic talks to Snake about a book after the torture sequence), is not here, or at least I don't know how to trigger it. The scene where Johnny talks of his family is here though, with stomach ache and everything.
-Secret Theater is also gone (bad thing because that joke on ""The Joy"" was priceless), maybe because they would have had to reanimate them again from scratch as they are not scenes for the game and thus not generated with the game engine.
-All the camos that were available for download (even DPM) are available from the Camouflage menu.
-Again all the interactions in menus/cutscenes are here, also the ones in the intro sequence (I even think there are more in the HD intro than in the PS2 ver); even all of them in the ""Press Start"" menu are there.
-And last but not-in the-least the Specials ""Metal Gear"" and ""Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake"" original vintage games that were included in PS2 Subsistence are here too. That is: You will be playing a NES game on a PS3! at 1080p.

In both of them you can still use what I call the ""Metal Gear reset method"", which is only holding START SELECT L1 L2 R1 R2 at the same time to get out the game to the game menu.

Two things that bothered me:
-You tap the Konami code and nothing happens. Even when it held no significance if you did input the code in the Konami logo it made the screen flutter a bit, like just thanking you for remembering, in Subsistence it did that and made a marking sound, but in the HD, nothing.
-----------EDIT-----------
The Konami code, still holds some power thought, If you enter the code in the pause menu, viewing the map, fighting the End (assuming you didn't kill him earlier), the code reveals his location and points it out on the map.
Thanks to Smolderin' Stu for the clarification
--------------------------
-American version button layout. Fans will remember that Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3 were ones of the few that advanced on ""CIRCLE"" and backtracked on ""X"" in the menus, this appear to be ""fixed"" on the HDs. I particularly liked the exclusivity that this brought to this saga, it felt like it made you remember that this is a Japanese game.

For Peace Walker:
-I believe they did't take out anything (can't be sure since I didn't exactly completed all of those missions, just the main ops up to ZEKE, and a few of the extras after)
-Since it was made for PSP, you feel (or those of you who played it on PSP) that the menu is, like too big for the TV screen, big letters, big logos, but my brother got used to it after a while, as would most of us if we stopped playing it on PSP.

All three of them have the new ""Transfarring"" feature, that allow you to pause the game on PS3, save and continue on PSP or Vita (if you already have the PSP or vita version of the same game).

All in all still the best saga of video games I've ever played, and I consider this a must-have for all MGS fans

-----------EDIT-----------
A few years later. DON'T, and I really mean DO NOT USE THE TRANSFARRING OPTION! on Peace Walker
After I played it on PSP and transfarred it on to PS3, I found out that the trophies on PS3 won't work on a save game original from PSP (as one would have imagined) naturally.
But Konami went far and beyond; I was forced to start a new game on my PS3, then I transfarred it to continue it on my PSP, but when I transfarred it back to PS3 I then found out that I couldn't get any thropies on that savegame either.
So basically, DO NOT USE THE TRANSFARRING option if you ever want your trophies.

Squad AI and enemy AI: This basically kills the game. The squad AI is so bad, the squad is a liability rather than an asset. Squad members will run out in front of you and block your shot, refuse to stay put when you tell them too, refuse to maintain distance and will therefore attract splash damage to you because they run up next to you, stand out in the open and just shoot away. The way the controls are set up, squad-mates are unnecessarily hard to issue orders to. For example, the game forces you to use a 'Biotic' power to destroy certain enemies. If you're a soldier you don't have access to these powers, so you have to use a squad-mate. To do so, you must have line of sight to the enemy that you want your squad-mate to destroy. WHY? How does this make any sense whatsoever? Why not just let the player switch control between characters like most RPGs of the 'recruit your squad-mates' variety do? Enemy AI is very primitive. While they us cover, it's very sparingly and they never do anything other than hold position or duck and weave between different cover. No grenade usage, no assault, nothing. BORING!
Sticky walls: ME1 decided to go with the '3rd person shooter duck and lean' system popularized by Gears of War. While it may work well on a console, here it's just annoying - you repeatedly stick to any bit of wall that you run into and un-sticking yourself is not smooth but you sort of have to pull yourself away. It's very annoying.
The Car & Mineral Collection: It's no fun to drive (in fact, it drives terribly and is very very aggravating) and they turn resource collection into a boring drive across empty terrain. If you don't do this, you can't buy the good stuff. So you just have to explore scores of worlds, driving across maps to find minerals. It's all very irritating and boring after the first time. The fact that this has to be done many many times made me decide to drop the game and stop playing it.
The BIOWARE recipe: Here's how it works - reveal a terrible calamity to the player. Have him move around the world collecting companions and harvesting resources by giving him boring, semi generic missions (the missions are basically identical between games. Try playing Dragon Age & KOTOR 1 alongside ME1 and you'll see what I mean). When he becomes Uber Powerful, lock him into a channeled sequence of events which culminates in him killing the boss in a (usually boring and repetitive shoot out so many body parts type) boss fight. We went there and did that with KOTOR 1 & 2, Dragon Age 1 & 2 and I hope by now people realize just how absolutely standardized all Bioware games are and how ME 1 stays true to this generic pattern.

You learn a set of skills and basically use them through the rest of the game to do the same thing--enter (through hacking), fight, and hack a solution.  That's it.

You would think that when releasing this game in 2006, Sony would look at its competition and make it equal or better. They did not. I apologize that so much of the review is comparing it to the Karaoke Revolution series, but it's a natural comparison, and unfortunate for Singstar Rocks, as SR is by far an inferior product.

I have a lot of the same complaints as others. There are no unlockables. Even though KR's strange costumes are seldom used in our household, it's nice to see things being unlocked as you sing more and better. Singstar Rocks does not do this.

The big thing is with the PS2 having two standard USB ports, why they would utilize the mini to USB adapter. This renders the mics useless to the KR games. If they're worried about being able to use an EyeToy simultaneously to two mics, maybe they should have included a USB mini hub instead. It infuriates me that with all the decent USB mics on the market that Sony again would go proprietary (of sorts).

Another complaint is the lack of adjustments. In song, KR (dating back to the original) allows you to adjust the vocals, mic and music. Singstar Rocks has only a master volume that doesn't see to do much.

It's also unfortunate that Sony stuck with only Sony artists, as they are missing out on a ton of others. The song selection is very random due to this and a couple are very strange selections to have on a sing along disc. There are multiple songs on here that do not make a lot of sense. Of all the Rolling Stones catalog, why would Forty Licks' ""Paint it Black"" be the one to appear. Lame!

In a vacuum, the game is fun, but its song selection, lack of options and its proprietary options all make it fall extremely short to any of the other Karaoke Revolution. Don't waste your time with this one. Get *any* of the KR series over this one.",Karoake Revolution,1167609600,19,,

There is some mediocre squad command tactics, with on on rail shooting in helicopters and trucks. The game tries to make it so that sand is a factor, unless your squad mates point out that a wall can be shot out you won't end up doing it. The guns and ammo are plentiful enough usually you will be out of ammo or close to after you have cleared the area. I like the fact that you can cancel your grenade throw instead of wasting it when the foes are gone.

The story is where you buy the game. It  has a very good Apocalypse Now, Heart of Darkness. There are multiple endings one is far better then the other and there are multiple endings to one of the multiple endings, say that five times fast. You lead a team to search and rescue the US army battalion that tried to save the city from a horrific sand storm. The lead character Captain Walker goes insane as he searches for the leader of the army battalion. The story line was dark with a lot of mess up scenes. The ending really made me appreciate some of the stuff the game put me through. And spoiler white phosphorous.

It had an ok multiplayer but the community wasn't there. Its one of the few games that I found all that collectibles. The intel you find delves deeper into the minds of the characters with audio logs and personal opinions of picked up items.

Pros-
Small

Has lots of memory left after a year of use

Cons-

When I remove it to show family members who are curious about the Vita, I plug it back in and all the bubbles moved.  Annoying.

So I get it.  Not all memory cards have exactly the amount of GB's they say on it.  My 4 GB memory stick actually has 3.82 GB's.  This memory card has 3 GB's less than what they advertise.  You truly only have 29 GB.

I know this has nothing to do with the actual memory card's performance, but it does hurt the Vita. The price.  I think there are 2 reasons that the Vita struggles (I happen to love my Vita and think everyone should get one) First reason is the PSP.  People didn't like the PSP Go (I think) and they are not going to buy a Vita because of it.  Good job Sony.  The second reason it is failing is because of the memory card prices.  When i bought this memory card it was like $75.  It has gone up in price.  Well done Sony.  Anyways you are basically forced to buy the 32 if you only want 1 memory card, even then you may need 2.

Funcom doesn't seem interested in releasing a fix for the problem or acknowledging that it exists.

It also sometimes stops responding to the mouse if you switch to another application (such as an instant message popping up), and the textures always get hosed if you switch, so that also is effectively a crash.

Also, saved games in the first slot cannot be restored, so you may find yourself confused at the very beginning.

They seem to have made this game more ""user friendly"" to try to bring in non-golfers. I can understand that mentality, but it means that we actually prefer the '07 gameplay a bit more than this one.

For example, let's take golf ball spin. When you hit a ball in the real world, often new players will swing from outside to inside which creates a slice. You can also swing from inside to outside to create a left-to-right bend. So in the previous game the joystick would mimic this - if you accidentally slanted the joystick while you pushed it, the ball would spin. However with '09 you do that through commands. That is, it no longer cares how well you ""swing"" in the game. I find this to be a step backwards.

The in-game challenges are fun. You have one long string of players you can challenge - and you can take on whatever ones you have enough points to take on.

Your skill is now based on how well you play. If you start hitting the ball accurately, your accuracy skill gets higher. So as you build up real in-game skills, the stats of your character reflects that.

The graphics and sounds are, of course, stunning. You really can immerse yourself into the golf world, listen to the sounds of the course around you, watch the clouds drifting, and feel like you are there. Yes, I'd recommend being on an ACTUAL course and getting some exercise - but how about when it's rainy? Snowy? Lightning storms? This is the perfect alternative to keep your golf interests well tuned until you can actually get out onto that green grass again.

For you young folks reading this and haven't the foggiest idea what a Grognard is, it is someone who enjoys playing board wargames, particularly the cardboard counter-heavy, hex overlaid paper game board, strategy wargames from the 1970s.

As technology and computer advances relegated us, old-soldiers, to past history, several computers games appeared designed to attract us.  These games were turn-based, multi-dimensional, operational control, involving strategy above all.  In truth, very few computer games ever came close to satisfying us old-timers.  There were some notable stand outs.  The original X-Com games are one of these.

X-Com was my first favorite computer game and still holds that position though it is tied with the Fallout series.  As I own all the old X-Com games I have attempted to use Dosbox to bring them back to life.  My computer skills are very limited to say the least and my results were less than pleasing.  I have been bugging Good Old Games (.com) to do their magic and re-release them, to no avail.  Imagine my surprise when I found, not one, but all five of the X-Com games in one package, right here on Amazon.com.  All right, so perhaps you cant imagine--so suffice it to say I was exceptionally pleased and excited.

The X-Com Collection is released as a download only, as far as I can tell.  The graphics, while still the simpler renditions of early '90s computer graphics, are crisp and clear.  Gameplay is smooth and of yet I haven't experienced any crashes in the program.  It plays just as I remember.  I started playing once the download was completed yesterday morning and I have only taken a couple of breaks until I stopped to eat and write this review.

The only downside for me is the need to use 'Steam' to host the game on-line, requiring you to be connected when you want to play.  For many of you, 'Steam' is an accepted and familiar requirement and won't be an issue.  Even with a distasteful taste in my mouth when having to deal with 'Steam' games, the download and setup took less than twenty minutes and went rather smoothly.

Game play consists of taking operational control over a world wide organization assigned to detect, investigate and untimely stop the invasion of earth by aliens.  You start with one base, with limited operational abilities, two top of the line air interceptors and a team of eight rookie soldiers attached to a high speed transport aircraft.  You control pretty much everything under your command.  You recruit new soldiers and purchase their gear.  You bring in scientists and engineers to research and build advanced items based on captured alien technology.  (Your starting base has a laboratory and a workshop with ten scientists and ten engineers)

You can build additional buildings which house large radar systems, alien containment cells, and additional living space, hangars, workshops and labs.  You can use your two Interceptors to patrol the skies to locate alien aircraft.  When the alert comes you send your Interceptors to shoot down the intruder with your squad of soldiers right behind.  With the alien space craft crashed on the ground, you send your soldiers in for a closer look. As you advance into the crash site much of the area is in darkness until you can maneuver your troops to get their eyes on the darkened areas.  You have control of each of your team members, who you can arm with pistols, rifles, grenades, smoke, high explosives, auto-cannons and auto-guns and even a tank.  As your scientists discover the secrets of the alien technology you can arm your soldiers with high tech weapons and advanced body armor.  Simply sending your interceptors out to ""splash"" the alien space craft isn't enough.  You must get your teams ""boots on the ground"" in order to capture the alien technology and beat them back from whence they came.

As the game continues you get to build additional bases, bring in more staff and soldiers.  You also have to keep the nations of the world happy with your progress as they are the ones who provide the vast amount of funds required to keep this operations in the black.  Fail to intercept a few alien missions into Russia, and suddenly you find Russia is only offering pennies for your funding.

This game is no different from the last released one (Just Dance 4) except it comes with different songs. Most of the songs are pretty great but I did not like the fact that all the ""really good"" songs needed to be bought in the Nintendo eShop. Most the songs costs $2.99 each which can make this game end of costing a lot in the long run. I got this used for about half the price of the new version and I've had no problems with it PLUS I still was able to download the Katy Perry track for FREE!

If you haven't played any Just Dance games before it's just a dancing game where you follow the on screen dancers. It's pretty easy and is mostly played for fun or used as a workout. I personally have lost a lot of weight playing these games. I enjoy dancing to the music as well. Some songs are recently released hits while others range from popular ""party"" songs and older hits.

I gave this game 4 out of 5 stars because although it's a great dancing game (which I love) I don't like the fact that they make you pay for all the ""good"" songs. The game comes with some songs that aren't that great but they really force you to pay if you want to dance to the popular songs. I recommend this game to anyone that has played any Just Dance game before and like it. I also strongly recommend buying this game used or when it's lower in price because if you want the really good songs you'll be paying extra to download them.","I suggest buying it used if you want all the ""good"" songs.",1393286400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"03 16, 2016",A3NF8KDLBE9JXI,B019IAC2OE,Riley,"So I recently bought this because I have yet to really play a newer Pokemon game. With X & Y being the first to introduce 3D I felt like the change from the original to now was so great that I'd be blown away by that alone. Just as I thought, after playing on this new 3DS, I have to say this is the best hand-held system I've ever owned. I am 26 years old so when the originals came out I was about 9, so this is a huge nostalgia trip for me. My first experience into Pokemon was unforgettable and thanks to this system, my new foray into the newest generation of games was also unforgettable.

This is my first 3DS system, as before I didn't care for the two screen design. Now though, I've come to terms with the functionality the 2nd screen adds and thus find this incredibly intuitive. The system operates flawlessly, feels absolutely amazing and substatial in my hands. When my wife bought me this she also bought my brother one so we could play together, unfortunately he was only able to get the generic N3DS XL version. It is also his first 3DS system and he says he loves it as well.

After playing with mine for a weekend and observing him play on his XL, I have to say I'm incredibly thankful I got this size of 3DS. I wouldn't have liked the XL simply because it's like holding a giant tablet, to me doesn't feel hand-held, instead it seems like it needs to be propped up. In the end I think the XL is just too big for me, I prefer smaller devices (considering we're not in 1980 anymore) and this one is just that; much smaller.

The plates came with Charizard pre-intalled, just had to snap on the top plate (didn't take much force either). The pre-installed versions of Blue & Red are much appreciated as it adds to the level of nostalgia. I also plan on using it as a wow factor for family. ""Hey ya'll check out what Pokemon looked like 20 years ago, and now!"" I can just see their faces of disbelief (as I'm sure I had when I first turned this on). What makes this the biggest nostalgia trip for me is the exact same art of Charizard and Blastoise from the original games. That art is simply priceless and never gets old to admire and look at. The device also comes with a free download of the Red & Blue Pokemon themes for the 3DS which plays the Pokemon theme song (from the game) in the background and adds Pokemon to the wallpaper. All in all, this is incredibly worth it, but I'd recommend buying this locally, I was able to find it at a local Fred Meyer for $175, but like I said before my brother wasn't able to get one because there was only 1 left. So, if you can manage to find this locally, and love Pokemon, then I suggest getting this. WARNING - there is no charger! I didn't know this because I haven't ever bought a 3DS before and was too excited to read the dumb box. Wasn't a huge deal, popped over to Wal-Mart and picked up an AC charger for $10. So for $185 I got this and the charger, I'm a happy camper!

Well I'm off to catch some more Pokemon, hope you too get to enjoy this great nostalgia trip.",Nostalgia at it's finest - Onto catch more Pokemon!,1458086400,,,

I was able to enjoy 80 hours of Final Fantasy XIII before I got fed up with it. The reason being; was because there was lots to unlock and several things to do even upon passing the video game. The biggest disappointment (statistically) is the way battles are fought. If the party leader should K.O during a battle, then it's a game over. One other thing I found to be another flaw was the summoning system; each character has their own assigned Eidolon. This means, you may just have to use your least favorite character , just to summon your favorite Eidolon. There are several other gameplay aspects that may disappoint, but there are also several things that make up for it. I still stand by the side of FFXIII due to it's amazing story and characters. You just have to bare with getting through a bunch of chapters with the hardship of fighting with just 2 characters for the most part of the game. THERE IS A LOT OF CHARACTER SWITCHING! Which you have no control over till the end of the game.

Graphics: The graphics in this game are by far beautiful! If you don't have an HDTV or any form of HD access, you won't reap the full benefit of playing Final Fantasy XIII. Graphics of this game are what fill a hole in it's many flaws. This game is almost HD to it's fullest extent.

Storyline: This is the main reason I had purchased Final Fantasy XIII (thus why I've purchased any Final Fantasy.)It's one of the more mellow stories told in the FF series, also it's something very different. Each character is somehow connected. I loved the storyline- it was well built and given the best characters ever. I really enjoyed it; I'm sure several others out there will.

Overall: I give this game a 5, because it's one of my favorite Final Fantasy's since 7. Even though it's flawed in many ways; there are things I just love about this game. I forgot to mention how great the music is in this game. The only disappointment is it's gameplay, which I didn't mind much- but give it a shot! I bought it when it first came out at it's introductory price; I would say the price it's at now is well worth it.

The characters are not very in depth, with the exception of Jansen. The rest of the characters are pretty dull in personality.
Also, I don't feel that there was enough strategy.
The only system of battle tactics that's basically needed to win consists of offensive and defensive buffing and powerful black magic spells. The hardest battles were few: like the snake at the beginning of the game, and the boss of the labyrinthe temple(whatever it was called). The battles were challenging, but the basic strategy never really changed, and the battles were overall kind of boring. All the spells were unoriginal and nothing more than light shows. I found the temple near the end of the game super tedious, and I was relieved when I finally found my way through that ridiculous maze. The biggest thing that let me down is the last boss fight. I fought him for what seemed like an hour or more, but he really didn't put a dent in my HP at all. It was so easy it was just dumb, but yet I'm still fighting for an hour through numerous cut scenes of rising tensions, waiting for the hard part, on the edge of my seat...but it never came. He just died. How stupid!
I gave this a 4 because it was intriguing for the most part all the way through the game, with several interesting twists, and the ship reminded me of FF8, which I love.

I've had maybe six over that time, the last two were model G-UF13a, and they were excellent (until they crapped out).  Logitech gamepads are generally very durable, but when they fail it is invariably the same mechanism (at least for me); sticking left joystick function for movement in a particular direction.  Guess they just wear out after millions of thumb movements.  Anyway, bought this F310 as Logitech's recommended replacement.

Pros:
- Sized about the same as the older versions and buttons/sticks are in the same places, feels about the same
- Seamless installation, downloaded latest software from the Logitech site and the controller immediately recognized my old game button programming
- Good price on Amazon

Cons:
- Trigger buttons have an annoying ""clack"" that wasn't there on older gamepads
- Cord is a few inches shorter than on the older controllers I had
- Lower left and right trigger buttons are mechanically differently than on older Logitech controllers.  They are an angled, swing-type actuation rater than the simple soft-button push of their older controllers.  This is why I can't give 5 stars to this controller.  I know it sounds like nit-picking; but if you use those buttons a lot and have been accustomed to the older trigger configuration that was used on Logitech's PC controllers for nearly two decades, it's an annoyance that old f*rts like me don't need.  It's a longer button push to get the functions to work, and then there's that annoying clack at the end.

Bottom line; I can recommend this controller (with reservations about the trigger buttons).  I'm sure I'll eventually get used to the button clack and the different triggers; but I'm a little disappointed in Logitech for not offering a better product.",Adequate; but Logitech could do better,1506384000,,,

As for the other titles where the natural game development shows by itself what do you have to do to get the other playable characters (actually the only thing that keep my kids challenged and tied up to the game); for this one even for me it's kind of confusing and non-sense to find out what to do or where to go to move ahead on the game. Kids are not that patient and may get tired easily because of that.
Lego's titles are becoming way too complex since our own Star Wars III-Clone Wars experience. And seriously, we prefered the old humming Legos over these new bla-bla ones.

Mega Man X6(2001). Part six of seven.
After the somewhat disappointing X5, another sequel appeared less than a year later. How is this possible? According to another reviewer, apparently both X5 and X6 were created at the same time by two different teams under Capcom. For the most part, X6 is a combination of X5's style and X3's complexity. It contains the same graphics and classic gameplay as the previous two X games, but there are several features to this game that set it apart from the others. Here's the breakdown:
PROS:
-THANKFULLY, THERE ARE NO MORE MANDATORY ALIA MESSAGES! Capcom realized this mistake from X5 and made this feature optional. A small ""!"" appears in the corner when you reach key points in the stage and if you ever need them (true MM junkies don't) just press select. Finally, we get completely uninterrupted gameplay!
-The difficulty has been Vamped up drastically. This can be a good thing and a bad thing (more on the bad later). The good thing is that the game is no longer a cake-walk to beat like X4 and X5. The enemies will definitely give the player something to keep busy with.
-Perhaps the most non-linear X game in the series. By that I mean all the levels are vast, containing two different exits, and large arena-rooms to explore. Plus, the secret items are all cleverly scattered. You have to do more thinking than ever before to obtain some of them.
-The sound effects are slightly different than before. Now the explosions really let out a BANG! Also, some of the stage tunes are a return to X4's techno hardrock style, namely the Heatnix, Wolfgang, Mijinion, and Shark stages.
-Rescuing the 128 different reploids. This adds even more depth to X6 and allows the player to gain enhancements by rescuing them.
-X can now use the Z-saber! While it is not very good as a rapid attack weapon, it does help to reflect projectiles in the heat of combat.
CONS
-Okay, now the bad thing about the difficulty: SOME AREAS IN THE GAME LEAD TO POINTLESS FRUSTERATION. When I say that enemies come in endless waves, I mean that they throw everything and the kitchen sink at you. It comes to the point where even a veteran MM gamer cannot make it through each stage without losing lives. THE NIGHTMARE SYSTEM DOES NOT HELP THIS. Often times annoyances like meteors, fireflies, blackouts, and impassible silver blocks will take more effort to get through than normal stage enemies, which is nonsense. AND ITS ALL RANDOMLY GENERATED.
-THERE ARE TOO MANY NIGHTMARE ENEMIES. In some stages like the museum, most every enemy you face will be one of those. A little more variety in the bestiary would have benefited.
-Besides the four tracks I mentioned, the rest of the music is dull, boring, popish, and often annoying. I personally cannot stand the museum stage tune. AND WHAT'S WITH THE GRUNGE INTRO TRACK? This does not even fit with the X universe!
-LEVELS ARE NOT RANDOMLY GENERATED LIKE THE BOX CLAIMS. Okay Capcom, I don't care if the levels were actually random or not, but it's a really bad move to make a boast about a feature that's not there.
-Once again, the bosses are rather easy to beat. This is a bit of a letdown after how incredibly hard some of the stages are. Contrary to this though, the mini-boss High Max, seems almost too difficult to beat.
-Like the whale stage in X5, THE REPEATING JUNK-BALL MINI BOSS IN HEATNIX'S STAGE GETS TEDIOUS AFTER GOING THROUGH THE STAGE MORE THAN TWICE. It hurts the most when you're going back to rescue just one reploid.
-The story pretty much shot down the drain with this game. The cutscenes, though voice-acted in Japanese, drag on for a looooooong time. Like I said with X5, BRING BACK THE ANIME CUTSCENES! Zero should either be here to stay or gone for good. None of this ""dramatic death and resurrection"" junk. One other thing, STOP RESURRECTING SIGMA! Play X6 for the gameplay itself, not the story.
-Once a reploid gets caught by a nightmare, he can never be rescued again. In order to get him back, you have to reload the game. This can get annoying with some reploids.
-X can obtain two excellent pairs of armor (Blade, and Shadow), BUT GETTING THEM REQUIRES YOU TO ENDURE THE RANDOM NIGHTMARE SYSTEM UNTIL THE RIGHT HAZARD COMES ALONG IN A PARTICULAR STAGE. You can't acquire anything else without them.
X6 as a whole is a fun, challenging, and more often than not, a frusterating game. However I only recommend this one to experienced gamers, as this is one of the hardest MM titles to date. With a bit more work, this game could have easily been a classic. Despite all the shortcomings, it succeeds in retaining the classic 2D gameplay that makes Mega Man games what they are. I'm only being so critical on this game because I am an incredibly big MM fan who cares about the series. The story is the weakest part of X6, but give the game a chance. It's at least worth playing through one time. Get equipped with bubble lead all over again and go give it a shot.",A good X game that had the potential to be great,1044057600,4,,

This is that game. It's online options are limited, and it's storyline is simple but not boring. The ease of use with the controls and the sheer fun of playing a dogfight style space shooter through GORGEOUS spacescapes makes this game one of the best of it's kind currently. It's a game I've finished several times and still find myself coming back to. Unlike many games, this one is still playable after you win the main story.

The thing is insanely sensitive and easy to break.  The first stupid thing it does is in its use, you put the Gameshark into the slot, then stick the game up on top of it.  As with many cartridge game systems, it seems you need to wiggle it about, and position it just right just for it to work.  I remember spending several minutes during the last leg of my first Gameshark's life trying to adjust the game on top to be slightly lop-sided, because it simply would not work if I just pushed the cartridge down all the way, like it's supposed to.

Of all the functions it has, half of them don't even work.  The function of basically making up new cheat codes based on gameplay regularly froze up games, and at worst, caused catastrophic damage to the Gameshark.  I remember one instance I tried to create a new cheat code, and ended up filling up my entire Gameshark's memory with useless information.  Almost none of the pre-set games and codes worked, names were screwed up with random characters and letters, and largely I had to just guess which code would do what for which game.

The fifteen minute instructional VHS that came with the Gameshark was a hilarious joke---both VHS's had the little plastic tab on the bottom STILL INTACT!  If you still remember how VHS's work, this means ANYONE CAN RECORD OVER THE VHS IF THE PLASTIC TAB IS STILL INTACT!  I could literally have recorded gay porn over the VHS, packaged it with the Gameshark, sent it back for a refund, and they likely would have sent the VHS in a new package to be sold to someone else!

Whatever benefits the Gameshark gives are simply not worth it in the long run.  It doesn't ruin your game permanently, but it ruins itself just fine.

I pre-ordered this game digitally and managed to get South Park Stick of Truth. As a South Park experience, it was exceptionally good. But unfortunately as a game, it was pretty underwhelming. The turn base combat was fine, I like that feeling of a classic RPG, but it was extremely easy that the game felt more like an interactive movie. Because of this, the game felt short as well, I honestly think the game took me around 6 hours to beat. Which as for a free download for pre-ordering the new game is fine, but I'd be lying if I said ""I wasn't expecting more."" The Fractured But Whole on the other hand actually felt more like a game while still having that South Park charm. See when I was playing the Stick of Truth, I used a lot of my already knowledge of RPG titles to essentially look every inch and cranny for special gear, equipment, and other items and it was like no matter what I collected, the only things that had use was the armor and the ""Junk"" you collected was... just that, junk. Throughout a majority of that playthrough I kept hold of everything because I thought there would be a crafting system, but reality they were all useless items that were made to only be sold to vendors. The Fractured But Whole actually is the opposite. This time, the equipment you wear has no effect on your character and you can look like however you like to. And the ""Junk"" this time around are crafting items as the game this time includes a crafting system. Though you'll have to buy recipes from vendors, but this time every item you pick up has some form of use. For those who think that the ""No Stats on Equipment"" may be a problem, don't worry it's not. This time your stats are all based on Artifacts that you can either find in the game, or craft on your own assuming you found the recipe. And as you level up, you'll gradually unlock new slots to add more artifacts, but there is a limit so it's not like you'll be able to equip every single artifact in the game. And the combat, the combat is probably what makes this game feel more like a game... well in comparison with Stick of Truth that is. I mentioned that the Stick of Truth was simple and easy, but what I didn't mention was how easy. The affliction status the game had (Shock, Bleed, Gross-Out, and Freeze) were fairly easy to abuse and take out opponents, making much of the game a walkthrough, even on the hardest difficulty. While the Fractured but Whole still includes these affliction statuses, they're not as common as it would be as instead of a turnbase RPG, it's more of a tactical RPG. You have to plan your moves and your attacks with the board you're on. And with each game having at least 8 characters on the field (you, 3 teammates, and 4+ opponents) you'll likely won't get every affliction on one opponent like you would in Stick of Truth. I've talked a lot of positives, what about negatives? Well there are some. First gripe, despite this game feeling like it has more challenge than it's predecessor, Ubisoft can ruin it and make your game experience a walkthrough. Ubisoft Club is implemented in The Fractured But Whole (just like every Ubisoft Published game) and it includes artifacts that are quite powerful to have both early and late game. And it may seem cool to get the Assassin's Creed Outfit plus Hidden Blade Artifact, that Hidden Blade Artifact can make a hard run be normal at worst, especially when you also equip the other two artifacts that are also offered in Ubisoft Club. What's more is these Artifacts can be upgraded in the crafting menu and all the requirements you need are... just the artifacts themselves. Well at least you also have to level up your crafting skill, but honestly it's not hard to pull off so you can pretty much bulldoze your way through the game. Another slight negative is this game... kind of takes place after the last season of South Park, Season 20; also known as the Story Season that not many liked. The Fractured But Whole will have Member Berries to find over Chinpokomon, and PC Principal is present too... but they're not that heavy noted in the game. I mean I don't like PC Principle but you really interact with him twice and that's it. But still, this could leave a sour taste in a few people's mouths as Season 20 wasn't all that hot. So is the Fractured But Whole worth it? Well even though I got nearly over double the hours compared to Stick of Truth, I think getting Fractured But Whole alone will be best when it goes on sale, maximum of $40. But if you happen to manage to find a physical copy of the game that includes Stick of Truth, then yeah I can safely say that this is a recommended purchase. South Park The Fractured But Whole is a great South Park game, better than the Stick of Truth in opinion. And the game has a lot of South Park references (New and Old) that wasn't featured in Stick of Truth. If you're a hardcore South Park fan, you'll certainly get a kick out of the game, as well as some laughs.",The Game Might be a Pun But I Could Be Wrong,1508716800,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

But I couldn't be happier to say that this game fits that bill! The gameplay is very simple - You jump, you punch/kick, you collect Lums, you do whatever it takes to go and rescue the trapped beings in them big cages. However, as simple as it sounds, it is amazingly executed. There are loads of elements that keep the flow of the gameplay at its max it's freaking unbelievable! Just watch the least bit of footage possible and you'll be amazed!

Again, the graphics are EYE-POPPING! This is the finest 2D graphics could go! Everything's all hand-drawn and cartoon-y! Just thinking about it makes my mind thrive with cheerfulness! I absolutely love this look! See the boxart? The game looks just like that! And the soundtrack makes those visuals even more appealing, yet it also adds to the game by itself.

There's so much about this game that I totally find awesome that I just can't put it all in one review (EX: I may as well mention now that there's a HILARIOUS intro when starting a new game). So, if you're still concerned, either go read other reviews or watch videos of the game being played. I prefer the latter.

Overall, this is as close to flawless as it gets. If you are a platformer fan, you'd be just plain crazy to pass this up! Heck, it makes Rayman 2 (Who some claim to be one of the best 3D platformers) look like complete crap! Yeah, I said it.

It was a decent enough system, but its biggest flaw is what finally did it in; the connector is too tight! My copy of Zelda 2 always seemed to get stuck in there and eventually the system's connector broke on one side. I glued it and it lasted many months after but finally the other side broke and I decided it was time for a new system.

First off, the controllers that come with this system suck! They're ugly, I don't like the shape, the layout, the feel anything. Luckily I have quite a few original controllers including the MAX, Dogbone, and Zapper and all of those work great!

The actual system however is fantastic. I like the actual look of it, seems like they tried harder than other clones to capture a look that goes with the NES and its accessories, especially with the ridges going across it.

The connector isn't too tight a fit like the Yobo and all my games come off of it with little effort! Also there's minor things in the performance I notice. The sound seems just a tiny bit better as well as the video.

All in all, this is a great system that I definitely recommend above all the other clones!",Much better than the Yobo FC,1302480000,2,,

It truly is every Halo enthusiast's dream come true. The only reason why this isn't a five star purchase is because the controller became defective about half hour into playing. Something snapped inside on the RT thumbstick and now sensitivity is suboptimal while aiming. I'm hoping I can resolve this minor set back quickly with MS... quite dissappointing to say the least. Never had this issue with Sony accessories. Xbox 360 controllers also had similar issues, with stick drift etc. Other than that i'm quite happy with my purchase.
Edit: Managed to exchange my controller directly from the MS store for a new special forces edition wireless one. Quick and painless... and it's working efficiently. Although I should mention I did get MS complete warranty for the console. In any case... this was a good deal, considering I got the Witcher 3(some of the best visuals I have seen)  with the free game promotion as well.

4.0,False,"05 7, 2001",A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B00004WHWC,Marc Ruby&amp;#8482;,"There is much to admire in THQ's latest release of ""Summoner"" for the PC.  This RPG has some of the best graphics and three-dimensional visualization I've seen in the past year.  The sets are quite complex and offer some breathtaking viewpoints.  Opponents are well animated with a variety of moves.  Cut scenes are abundant, and are a major source of continuity.  Sound design is exceptional as well.
The story itself is straightforward.  Joseph, born a summoner has fled to the village of Masad after his undisciplined use of his summoning skill calls a demon that destroys his home village of Ciran.  Unfortunately Murod, the evil emperor of Orenia has heard a prophecy that a summoner will destroy him and is searching for Joseph.  The story opens will Masad's destruction at the hands of imperial forces and Joseph's flight to the capital city of Lenele where he will seek his old mentor and try to regain control over his own fate.
The first part of the story takes place in Lenele's streets, sewers and buildings as Joseph gains in skill and power while he begins to assemble his party.  Soon thought he is out in the world of Khosos traveling to other cities and facing random (and not so random) conflicts.  There are many side quests, which provide sources of experience while Joseph and his friends struggle to stop the onslaught of Murod and his hideous generals.  Joseph's team will grow to include Flece, a master thief, Rosalind a mage of the Order of Iona and Jekhar who became Joseph's sworn enemy when Ciran was destroyed.
""Summoner"" is a large game, with a lot of enemies to defeat.  There are plenty of opportunities for hacking and slashing as well as spell casting.  Joseph's special ability to summon demons and Flece's thieving add extra dimension.  Bugs are few and far between.  Altogether a very effective conversion of a PS2 game.
There are a few drawbacks though.  Combat and control are a bit awkward, and take a lot of getting used to.  There's simply too much mousing around to do.  As a result battles drag out.  The fighting AI's are pretty good, but the players running on auto are prone to run off and do the wrong thing just when you want them to follow the leader and sneak by some potential trouble.  A few scenes get repeated a bit too often (I think I had to fight my way through Lenele's sewers four or five times).  If you leave the viewpoint on auto it has a habit of picking bad angles of vision.  All of these things act as irritants.  Towards the end it's a real temptation to start up a trainer and let the game run on auto as much as possible.
OK, ""Summoner"" isn't perfect.  But its overall quality is pretty impressive.  2001 has been a dry year so far and ""Summoner"" provides many hours of good gameplay.  If nearly genocidal hack and slash RPG's are your cup of tea, this is the game for you.",Beautiful But Deadly,989193600,11,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Konami has released a highly popular arcade game called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is based off of the also popular comic and television series of the same name. In the same year, Konami also made a TMNT game for the NES. It was rather a platformer instead of a port of the arcade game. A year later, the arcade game was ported to the NES as TMNT II: The Arcade Game. Now, here's TMNT III, released in 1992. Is it as good as the arcade game?

Yes, it is. The graphics are even better, the sounds are great, the music still rocks, and the gameplay is pure beat 'em up goodness. If you loved the arcade game, then you will totally enjoy smashing through ninjas in this game's levels. In face, there are some cool new moves you can perform. You can also just flat-out pick up the enemy with your weapon and throw him behind you!

The action is also tighter than in the arcade game. Unfortunately, the life bar isn't as big as the previous game (NES version), but at least you can still plow through the enemies easily. I find myself using the pick-up-enemy-with-weapon move very often. It kills the enemy within 1 hit, while it takes 4 hits to kill with normal attacks.

I saw that RE5 was coming out and thought ""If one thing was to convince me to get a PS3...""  Well, i finally decided to bite the bullet and purchased a PS3 and RE5, and I have not been disappointed.  All in all, it isn't as good as RE4 (I could go into detail as to why,  but lets just leave it at that) but obviously the graphics are better and some of the other differences are better as well.  ok, i'm starting to ramble...

Chris & Sheva - it was weird at first having some AI person following you around and yelling every 5 seconds ""OK!!!"", but once i got used to it, i really enjoyed that aspect of the game.

no ""run and gun"" - one of the biggest complaints by most people. sometimes it sucks, but you get used to it, and after playing Dead Space and Uncharted (which are almost as good) - I have come to garner respect for the increased difficulty with this aspect...I also enjoy the increased accuracy that comes with this, when you are fighting Zombies, headshots are key!

What really makes this game so great is its depth. Uncharted is great, but there's not a whole lot to it, you just follow the story, jump around like a monkey and shoot a lot of people. In RE5, every single opponent has a different optimal strategy (type of weapon, place to shoot them, etc) to beat, I like puzzles, some people don't but having a boss where you just shoot him a bunch of times isn't much fun for me, having a boss where you have to devise a strategy, shoot him in one place, then switch weapons to shoot him in his true vulnerability, thats where its at!

Anyway, great game, the Gold standard I hold every other game to.  Dead Space was pretty close. Uncharted 1 was not too bad. Resistance 2 was pretty boring for me.

This game is riddled with bugs, frame-rate dips, lag, and nearly every cut scene in the game has delayed texture pop-in. Also, LITERALLY every cutscene has audio-sync issues; no cutscene as of yet has had the characters' dialogue audio match the physical mouth movements; this issue is absolutely pervasive, so much so that I've given up expecting textures, graphics, and audio to function normally at all in the game's cutscenes, which there are many (since the game is heavily story-driven, the interactive cutscenes are a key factor and take up much of the gametime).

Luckily, amidst occasional glitches, the game's core gameplay mechanics still seem to function okay, though many other reviewers, both here on Amazon and elsewhere, are claiming their copy doesn't even do THAT well enough, and even has persistent crashing at certain points in the game, and I thoroughly believe it, so buying the PS3 or 360 version may be a gamble.

This game takes place 6 years after the Mansion accident in the first game. You play as the famous Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil 2. He is now working as an agent for the CIA, and the president's daughter gets kidnapped. His mission is to go on a solo mission to try to receive her, all why trying to discover why a small, quiet town is suddenly in an uproar; enraged, and on a killing spree, they all seem to be after you... the question is why.

***THIS REVIEW FEATURES NO MAJOR SPOILERS ABOUT THE GAME, ENDING, OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD STOP YOU FROM PLAYING IT***

Gameplay - (10/10) - I am usually a very critical game, so for me to not have any complaints in a game is near impossible. This on the other hand, features none, except one. The frame rate is perfect, the controls are great, but there is slowdown in some of the CGI. I didn't take off points for it, but it is there. Ragdoll physics are put to great use in this game, and some minor tweaks have been made to the already great Resident Evil series. The most noticeable is the elimation of set camera angles, over the shoulder camera, the ability to aim (so realistic that his arm actually struggles to keep steady), and the ability to save without having ribbons. You also get a larger inventory, and can collect money to buy weapons from vendors. The game is so much longer than other Resident Evil games, that the second disc actually seems not surprising at all. The game runs about 25 hours, I beat it in 21:43 my first time through (got it shipped early :). This whole gaming experience is just great. When an enemy tries to grab on to you, trying to bite your neck or eat your brains you can kick them off, or kick their head (if they are weak enough, they experience a very awesome head explosion death). You can also kill innocent cows and chickens and such (monks later). This game requires you to observe a little more, for instance, you can shoot down a chandileer that is lit, and incinerate all of the enemies below. You can ride in a boat, run from giant rocks, and many many more. The story also gets very immersive later in the story, but I'll stop at that so that I don't slip any spoilers out.

Graphics - (10/10) - I don't know if you've seen the game lately, but the graphics are amazing. Bordering the graphics of some PC games, and featuring better ragdoll physics than some as well, the game runs as smooth as it looks. Models, enviornments, and atmosphere are all very detailed and believable. Blood looks a little fake, but the there is enough that it doesn't matter. The game is a lot more polished than the demo, smoothing out some of the jaggies, and making the game look just unbelievably amazing. This games graphics are some of the best seen anywhere, and will still be great 5-10 years from now, even when compared to FMV sequences.

Sound - (10/10) - Each weapon sounds as intense as it should, cows moo, chickens cluck, all is good. The creepy groanings and intense musical score as the mindless people attempt to eat you alive really heighten the game as a whole. Every sound is rendered great in this game, from the water ripples to the footsteps, to the dog squeels, and the sawing clunking bodies of those captured by the possessed people hitting wooden posts or getting burned. The sound in this game is one of the key factors, and the bonus soundtrack with songs from both Resident Evil movie soundtracks are pretty cool as well.

Value - (9/10) - The most value out of any offline Resident Evil game. This game is one that you will definately want to go through more than once. You can get things you didn't see or missed, get better weapons, and try it on hard mode. There are a lot of unlockables, which I will not name because I count them as spoilers, but lets just say it well worth it. Mulitplayer would have been cool, as well as a Co-Op mode, but I think the game is fine the way it is, with or without multiplayer capabilties.

This is not just a game for fans. Fans will love the story, the possessed people, and the adventure, where non fans will love how the game is much quicker paced, much more fun, has more weapons, easier to control, and just a great shooter in general.

Anyways onto this review, this is one of the best Sonic games ever made, right up there with the legendary sequel to the first game and also the mind blowing Sonic 3-D blast! The worlds are very detailed and the music in some of the levels are really good like Lava Reef and Death Egg Zone to name 2 of my favorites. The game is designed very similar to Sonic 3 with a sub-boss in the middle followed by the mustache maniac Robotnick. The fact that you can lock it onto sonic 3 makes it that much more enjoyable and makes sonic 3 that much longer. You lock it onto Sonic 2 and now you can enjoy all those classic zones as Knuckles and discover new secrets about the game.

There have been a series of video games based off of serious movie and comic franchises. From Indiana Jones to Star Wars there have been a lego video game based off of it. Now Tell Tale games have unleashed their latest game called Lego Marvel Super Heroes but is this a game you will want to play?

The game centers on the villains that have banded together to free their brethren from secured facilities. From Rykers Island to the Raft six groups have been formed and each of them are in charge of all the lackeys underneath them. The six teams are led by such iconic villains such as Ultron & Loki , Dr. Doom, Tinkerer, Dormammu & Baron Mordo, Magneto & Mystique and Enchantress, Executioner, and the Mandarian. They have banded together to build a Doom Ray of Doom to unleash against the world. Nick Fury decides that he is going to need some help on this one as he summons the worlds greatest heroes to help him capture these bad guys.

And the roster of heroes that you will be able to play as is just as immense. Thor, Wolverine, Spiderman and Deadpool are just a sampling of the great characters you can play as. Each of the missions allows you to choose between two heroes and go against hordes of a common enemy. For example the first mission that takes place in New York has two heroes (Spiderman and Nova) going after the Sinister Six. And the bosses of course reflect this as you will be going up against Doctor Octopus , Electro and others.

One of the unique features of this game are the comic missions that you can undergo. Some of the more iconic missions are going after your uncles killer as Spiderman. Or you can head over to Japan as Wolverine to battle the Silver Samurai. These comic missions are a nice touch to the game as you can relive some of your favorite memories in Marvel history.

5.0,False,"11 20, 2014",A1PSBR3JRZ9VO0,B00NMO0IA8,Vdub,"The Xbox One version of this game is about what you would expect: Awesome.

Are the graphics noticeably better with breathtaking hi-res textures and more complex polygons and animations? Ha! But that's not what Minecraft is about.

There's no real story or campaign or objectives in Minecraft. You simply start out, have a variety of tools and environments to explore/destroy/build upon, and do whatever you want from there.

Complexity ranges from ultra simple (TNT go boom lolz!), to as horrendously complex as you want to make it (wiring switches to do all kinds of crazy things, create meta-games, and so forth).

There's the standard mode where you have a life bar, more limited resources (which forces you to craft/farm/mine for resources), and enemies. Or creative mode which is more suited for purely creating awesome stuff faster and easier. You can fly, move super fast, have unlimited materials, and so forth. Creative mode will prove to be a much easier way to build that replica Death Star you've been wanting for so long.

The console versions of Minecraft are always a little bit behind the PC version in terms of updates, but most won't notice or care except the die-hard Minecrafters. I prefer the console version simply because I prefer my couch to my office chair.

One important thing to note is that if you bought the Xbox 360 version previously (digital), you can purchase the Xbox One (digital) version from the Xbox Store for a discounted $4.99, which was totally worth it in my opinion. The Xbox One version also has many new achievements compared with the 360 version (1000 points worth vs 200 points). You may not care about these, but I personally love trying to fully explore the games and unlock all their achievements, so this adds a *lot* of replay value for me. Some of them will take quite some time to attain as they can't be unlocked in Creative mode.

But digital discounts aside, I generally prefer disc versions of games. Physical games tend to go on better sales and more frequent sales, they help me expand my fairly expansive physical game library, I don't have to worry as much about disk space, I can lend the game to a friend or resell it, and I have the pleasant feeling of actually owning something tangible. But if these perks don't interest you, the convenience of digital is nice to have to (switch games without swapping discs).

It might take awhile of tinkering around with the game before you ""get it"", but once you do, it can be a lot of fun.","Everything is awesome! Oops, wrong franchise.",1416441600,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One Digital Code'}",

As far as the difficulty in building a good mech goes, it has nothing to do with spending time to get ""better parts"", it is all about learning how to build a better mech. You really need to spend time finding out what kind of mech works for you. That does indeed take some time and effort, but all the parts to build a decent mech are all right there. Sure, there are some advanced parts that you can aquire through the Marketplace, playing through the storyline, or bidding on in the auction, but they aren't anything spectacular. This game is not for people who want to plop in a game disk, find the rocket launcher, and get 30 kills.

I really enjoy this game, it isn't as fast paced as the MechAssault games are, but the customization is so much fun. Anyone willing to spend the time  to tweak their mech just right to fit them is going to have lots of fun with this game. I personally love my little hovercraft mech with 4 pile weapons and a machine gun on it. It is fast, maneuverable, and can eliminate almost any mech with just two hits. Throw an NA jammer on it during multiplayer games and come up behind the commander mech and take him out before he even knows you're there.

To me this game plays like FF12 except the fact you can combine skills to create combos which you might hardly ever use because of the action blocks you try to save for transforming into the white night. The skill set up would be cool if each character had there own signiture moves, instead each character can learn the same skills as everybody else. There are very few treasure chests to find in the game and half the time there not worth getting because they might hold a lowsy healing herb or some peace of armor or weapon you already have, so don't expect alot of hunting around for riches. Not a whole lot in variety of armor or weopons either,as every character can equip all the same stuff so once again no special outfits for different characters.

This game does have a long single player campaign. You have cities that you have to defend. Each city is shaped like a circle with rings of defense. In each ring there are individual squares where you build each structure. You build structures like gatling guns, sniper guns, missle launchers, power plants, and housing for civilians. The point of civilians is to get taxes out of them to get more money to build more and better structures. You can also upgrade each structure up to at least level 10.
You get to choose which city and which enemies you want to fight to earn money, crytals, and advance in the story. After each level if you win you also get civiilians to move into the city. The better you did the more civilians and crystals which are used for certain structures. There are levels of enemy attacks from 1 on. The lower the easier and it is infinite the amount of times you can beat enemies so you can grind and level up your stuff as much as you want. Also there are bosses after you play a certain amount of enemies in a row. There are also leaders who give you special abilities like reduced cost of structures or superuattacks who you level up as well.
If you like tower defense or strategy I bet you will like this. It is a very deep game  FOR A TOWER DEFENSE GAME. You don't do anything but tower defense so if you don't like that then sure as hell DO NOT BUY THIS.
I did not give it 5 stars because it can get boring and repetitive so it is best in short bursts. Also the story is useless and the commanders for some reason are teenagers and is non sensical. They coulda made it better by making it older and more realistic commanders. Also 30$ is steep for any tower defense game even one as deep and long as this. Maybe it is just cuz I am cheap but 20$ woulda been perfect.

In conclusion,
I HIGHLY RECOMEND buying this game if you like TOWER DEFENSE GAMES. If you like strategy buy it if you can get it for 20$ or less.

Characters
Each character has their own special taunts and comments they say when they win or loose.  Characters don't change the way the game plays at all they just add to the hidden content you can unlock such as artwork. (4/5)

Gameplay
The game plays just like any other bust a move. (You shoot colored orbs in a dirrection and connect the same color with others similar to break them and clear the board.)  Something new with this is you can play with up to 8 people with 4 remotes and 4 nunchucks.  This 8 player is a load of fun with a house full of people.  (4/5)

Graphics
Well its a wii game and we know the wii doesnt produce exactly cutting edge graphics.  Anyway reguardless it is very colorful and cartoonish.  The powerups and orbs look very brilliant in color. On a side note the additinal unlocked artwork is a nice bonus. (4/5)

Replayability
There are over 200 levels to play on this game so there is a lot to do to complete it fully.  Also you can replay certain levels you want to do better on.  The game has a way of keeping you coming back every once in awhile to have a little fun.

Controls
This is the big one.  The controls are used with the wii motion.  You move your controller side to side to angle where you shoot your orbs.  This is a great added bonus over traditional controllers because you get an actual feel for where you want the orbs to go.  This also adds human error because if you move the controller or don't have steady hands you can mess up your throws.  (5/5)

Overall, the game is good.  However, when stacked against its PS3, 360, and PC brethren it fails to compare, but that doesn't mean it's not fun.

The plot is your standard alien invasion story/government cover-up.  Nothing new, but it's still intriguing.  The graphics are nice to look at, considering it's the Wii.  However, I really don't think they are that much better than Metroid Prime: Corruption's.  It does have a solid framerate with decent shadows and particle effects.  The controls are similar to Metroid's.  Aim with the Wiimote and move with the nunchuck (pretty precise).  I like how you can throw grenades using the nunchuck, but it takes a little practice (I usually end up throwing them way over the enemies heads).

There is a nice assortment of aliens/enemies.  Environments are a little bland (again, it's the Wii).  Maybe it's me, but sometimes the AI can be brutal.  Enemies come in waves and there's no cover system, so you really have to keep moving.  In that vein, the game really doesn't have much that's innovative.  Even the All Seeing Eye (A.S.E) doesn't do much more for you than expose switches on the walls or explosives on the ground.

The Conduit was the main reason I bought another Wii (I had previously sold my first one because it was collecting dust).  At this point I'm probably enjoying House of the Dead: Overkill more than The Conduit.  It's not that I don't like The Conduit.  I just may have had overly high expectations.  At some level I'm probably comparing it to Killzone 2, Gears 2, and COD4 (which I know I shouldn't do).  As a Wii FPS, it's a definite 4 stars.

As some have said, yes the game can be fun for a short period of time but then you'll most likely never get the urge to play it again. Doing some simple tasks in the game proves to be a bigger chore than in other versions and the cities you create feel empty and lifeless.

It is not surprising then that Tecmo managed to transform their 2D franchise to 3D in an exceptional manner.

This game is a remake of Ninja Gaiden Black from Xbox (thus Sigma, meaning the sum). I never played the Xbox version, but after playing this game for the first few hours, I wondered why I waited so long. The game looks fantastic, running 1080p at 60 FPS (all the graphics have been overhauled). The control feels really tight, and making nimble moves feels natural. The learning curve may be steep for some, but the result is quite worth it. I was not a proficient ninja for the first few chapters of the game, but now that I have somewhat mastered Ryu's moves, I am able to quickly dispatch a group of enemies with grace and ease, with their heads rolling, literally.

The game contains additional playable character Rachel, as well as additional weapons over the Xbox version; dual sword wielding is awesome. You can unlock additional costumes, hair styles, and difficulties.

If you feel competitive, the game allows you to upload your scores to Playstation Network to compare with players around the world. You can see how many times they died, the time it took them to complete the game, and how many ninpos (special moves) were used.

What this game lacks in flashy graphics, it makes up for in one key area, an area that is important in the original Romero movies, as well as Land of the Dead. Melee weapons. you have a host of different melee weapons to use, each with its own special uses. Such weapons include a hammer, a baseball bat, a golf club, and a shovel. Also, you can pick up a fire axe. If you just had a bad day at work, and take it from me, i have had them, just sit down with this game, pick up a fire axe, and imagine that the zombie horde is really your boss. It truly helps you calm down, after removing his jaw, arms, and legs with said axe.

but anyway, this game is good for what it presents, and that is good, clean zombie filled mayhem.",Some people need to realize why you buy games.....because they're FUN,1168732800,3,,

If you have some familiarity with the series (I had read that some missions in this game were taken directly from the console versions), then you probably have some idea of what is going on.  I found myself struggling with the awkward character movement and unclear objectives.  Also, (and this might be my fault for not reading the instructions) I could not save in the middle of a level and return to that point later.  When I saved and turned the game off, it always started me at the beginning of the level instead of where I left off.

I found the game controls to be very clumsy, particularly when trying to manuever Sam near the edge of a cliff or dropoff.  It is really easy to send him falling.

As some other reviewers had pointed out, the settings in this game are very dark.  You will need to use the night vision goggles most of the time, which gets annoying.

I agree with the other 2 reviews posted to date. Just purchased it, have played for 2 hours, and will update this ASAP.  It's a fun game with very good graphics.  I have not read the directions yet, (like to jump in and play first), and found swinging confusing until I realized how it works.  You lift your club until the blue line on the power bar, equals the distance you need to drive. Totally different than Wii golf, and should not be confused with a real golf match game.  However, there is enough golf, and interesting scenery, to satisfy my desire for a second game. This game is a sleeper, and will get much more playing time than some other titles I have reviewed.

While Miis are not used, the characters are a definite plus. They are lifelike humans, rather than cartoonish. When you have some winnings, you take your character to the clubhouse, and dress them as you like. The costumes range from conservative to highly suggestive.  I wasn't able to purchase the new clothing, but I was able to change my character into the different outfits.  Initially, you only have a choice of 2 characters. I am using Hanah, a cute and personable girl of about 20. She has a cute voice. Based on my initial 3 hole practice round (done 4 times until my first birdie), I expect to put quite a few hours on this game.

This is my update.  I have now read the directions.  Marginal help.  Then I went through the tutorial again.  I was making a lot of mistakes.  You need to go through the tutorial a second time.  It means more after you have played. You can change the direction of your putts and drives, just like Wii golf.  The special shots are fun. I just finished 3 more hours of play.  The game is addictive, once you understand it. You have to like humor. I like Rayman Rabbits.  I think 8 years and up is an appropriate age level. Girls 8+ will especially like the different costumes and accessories available.  Boys will just like the game play. It's also great for adults.  I'm a retiree.  The key is to go through the tutorial several times. Once before you play. then at least once after you have played for 1-2 hours. I was initially frustrated before I went back to the tutorial.

My first reaction?...[WOW]!!! Then after playing it for a while(read: about 2 minutes), every doubt in my mind was gone.
The first thing you notice after it boots up is just how gorgeous it is. This title is just as good, or better, than any game on the PS2(Gran Turismo 3 wasn't out yet). The game flows at a steady 60 frames-per-second, and rarely drops below. And remember how blocky and jerky Sonic and friends were in the first game? No more. The characters have been re-tooled to where they look almost completely round(except around the eyes and gloves where you can really see the poly's, but who cares?) and move more realistically then ever before.
On the character front, there are some changes. First off, Big and E-102 are gone(although Big has several cameos, but he's pretty hard to find). In their place are two all new characters. Shadow(Sonics' rival) and Rouge(Knuckles' rival). Shadow is almost just like Sonic, except his colors are black and red, and he wears special hover-shoes, so he never actually touches the ground. Rouge is a white bat(who is of the female gender I might add) who, at the same time as Knuckles, is trying to find the pieces of the master emerald for her boss, Eggman.
Gameplay-wise, this game really excels...and falls behind. On one hand, Sonic and Shadows levels are quote:""Way past cool!""(sorry), and Tails no longer races Sonic. His game is now a lot like E-102's, except it is more fun. Also, you can actually play as Eggman! His game is just like Tails', but in different levels and on the dark side of the story. Plus...the overworld is gone! You now go straight to the next level(after a cut-scene, though), just like the good ol' Sonic games. But on the other hand, the 'search and gather' levels of the first game are back. That alone isn't the bad part. The bad part is, they're twice as hard, twice as large, and twice as boring. It wouldn't be so bad, but you now must find the emerald pieces in a certain order, so in the later levels, they take about 20 minutes to complete. No joke. Plus, you MUST complete them to advance.
Another bad part is the camera. In the first game, if the camera was stuck, you could press the D-pad for a close-up, and then reset it. But now, except for being able to rotate it, the camera is now up to the computer. This causes you to play some of the levels many times.
There is also a two-player mode, which was absent from the first go-around. And while it is not very deep, it does add some replay value.
Overall, this is an excellent successor to the earlier Sonic games, and is a great addition to your Dreamcast library. The fact that it is Sonic, alone, should make you buy it. But if you're not a Sonic freak, this game will make you one. Get it.",The hedgehog shows no sign of slowing down,1014508800,2,,
5.0,False,"05 15, 2015",A3K91X9X2ARDOK,B00TDM91CY,Terrence A.,"State of Decay is such a great game that I'm almost at a loss for words trying to come up with proper and adequate praise for it. Even if this updated and improved version of the original Xbox 360 game is still a little rough around the edges, the game itself more than makes up for any shortcomings with some truly immersive and addicting gameplay.

Due to the game's open ended sandbox nature, you can expect to find yourself in many different situations that don't play out anywhere near how you thought they would, that is, if you even saw them coming in the first place. The game does a great job of conveying the mood and atmosphere of a zombie apocalypse scenario. There's a weighty, oppressive feel to the game mainly due to the general nature of the game and how it's meant to be played. Going out for food and supplies isn't an option here, it's a necessity and one that will turn around and bite you in the backside if you're not being mindful of such things. As you play and build your characters up, you'll inevitably start getting attached to them, which only sets the stage for you to be utterly devastated if and when you lose one of them. It's a pretty easy thing to have happen as it's very easy for your characters to get overwhelmed in this game due to several key factors: limited inventory space, stamina and the game's unpredictable world. Go in gung-ho and more often than not, you can expect to pay the ultimate price of a grisly death. Many times I found myself dying because I thought I was the man, so to speak. I'd throw myself into a horde of zombies, just to tire myself out from swinging my weapon incessantly and getting overrun while trying to run for it.

I've made much of the game's unpredictable events and I think it's here that the game truly shines. Yesterday I was playing and I had to go from one corner of the map to the other to retrieve a memento for one of the characters. Easy as pie, I thought. I took a pick up truck from my home base and set out across the game's sprawling map, weaving in and out of junked cars and running down dozens of zombies with impunity. I spotted a destroyed bridge ahead that could be jumped with a vehicle if I pulled it off perfectly.... which of course, I didn't. The truck flipped, tossing me out of the side window and then exploded a few moments later from being upside down on the ground. Now the situation had changed; I was out in the middle of the woods with only a couple of painkillers and an energy drink to keep me alive. I'd purposely taken only a reload's worth of rounds for my rifle from the base supply locker so I'd have to be careful making my way to my goal, a ranger station a few hundred feet away. To make a long story short, it took me over an hour and a half just to get back to my home base and everything that happened to me during that space of time was harrowing and intense, worthy of a detailed, written story. The best thing is, the game is full of moments like this and pulls the carpet out from under you whenever it can to make sure that nearly every encounter with the Zeds is a unique and memorable one

Now, that's not to say that the game is perfect, especially from a technical standpoint. It has its fair shares of shoddy glitches and half baked elements that give the impression that the game is almost incomplete at times. It's a huge improvement over the Xbox 360 version but still, you get a fair amount of clipping and pop-up at times, which really shouldn't be a factor in this generation of console games. A lack of variety in voice over actors is noticeable and the AI on the NPC's can get a little funky at times but for the most part everything operates at a serviceable rate and you'll be fine more often than not. I could also comment on the game's lack of a multiplayer component but since Undead Labs are bringing that into their next game, I really don't mind the absence of it.

I can go on and on about how much I absolutely adore State of Decay but I'd rather just end it all by saying that if you allow yourself to be taken in by this game and keep yourself from getting frustrated by the game's glitches and bugs, you'll have an absolute blast with it. With the inclusion of the two DLC expansions included from the Xbox 360 version as well, you'll have plenty to keep you busy for weeks to come. State of Decay is a love letter to fans of the genre and it shows when you notice the little touches. One can't help but smile when the new house your survivors have taken over is listed as the ""Savini Residence"".

Instead of talking to women, working out puzzles and trying to persuade them to spend some quality time with you, here you have a number of arcade games to complete to pass the game. It's the most laziest game design I'd ever seen, my heart sank when a majority of the puzzles required you to play Pong or take photos. The comedy in the game is okay, but it does wear out its welcome when most of the jokes rely on swearing and the fact they've all been done before to better effect in previous titles. Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude also has little reply value compared to its predecessors. A game like Larry 7: Love For Sail had heaps of secrets programmed into it that kept the gamers busy for months playing with shortcut keys and program files. In MCL, all you have to do after you finish is keep playing annoying arcade games until you can afford to make everyone nude.

There's almost nothing here for the long time fans except slight nudity and a few cheap references to the previous titles. Although it should be noted, Sierra tried to win the old time fans over by saying the series creator, Al Lowe, would participate in the creation of this title as a creative consultant. However, months went by with Lowe not receiving any word from the developers. People had grown impatient and evidently gave up hope on Sierra making an effort to contact Larry's creator. However, just before the release of the game, Lowe recieved an e-mail from the developers. It turned out the only involvement they intended for Al Lowe was to make him sign a waver that wouldn't allow him to criticise the game when it came out. Lowe humbly refused their offer.

If you want a game that shares the Larry series traits, look over eBay for Freddy Pharkas, Frontier Pharmacist.

If you're just after a little computer nudity, can't you find cheap Hentai instead?

I read some reviews stating the graphics were bad. Perhaps the PC version has far superior graphics? All I know is I spent a lot of time in between the fighting just looking around at the fantastic blend of realism and fantasy environments. Trudging along snow-covered mountain passes, looking down to see thousands of Orcs miles below all carrying torches...beautiful! Cautiously, quietly moving through a dark, creepy wood with spider webs all about. These and many other beautifully rendered environments were a joy to behold.

Character models are also done very well. It is nice to play a game where not every dwarf looks exactly the same as every other dwarf (and the same goes for all the ""races""). Those characters included here which we met in the films are also rendered quite well.

Mechanics/Inferface - 6/10

I have played many CRPGs over the years...Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Fallout, Elder Scrolls series, etc.. This game fits snugly into the Action RPG category. It does not have extraordinary depth in character customization, but what it has is adequate. Upon leveling you add to attributes and select skills from three skill trees for each character. This brings up a negative that I have learned to live with but wish it had been handled differently. You start the game as either a human male Ranger, an elven female mage, or a dwarven male fighter. At waypoints throughout the game you have the opportunity to switch to one of the other two or remain with the same character. Inhabiting one of the characters is the only time you can change their weapons, armor, or other gear, and add to their stats/skills. I would have liked a bar on the screen letting me know how close to one of these waypoints I was. The positive side of this gameplay is that those of us who tend to stick to one character type (mage, thief, or fighter) in most RPGs are encouraged to try out other styles of play. The interface is somewhat simple as this game is a console port, but everything works fine. Just don't expect a dozen spells and other things mapped to numerous keys.

Story - 9/10

I really enjoyed being part of the conflict depicted in the LotR yet not playing a rehash of the characters/plot of the books and movies. In WitN, you are a significant factor in helping the characters from the books/movies succeed, but you have your own adventures separate from those of Frodo. I felt the way the stories intertwined, and the way the characters interacted, was done very intelligently.

Gameplay - 7/10

My favorite type of game is the deep, open world, story driven RPG with lots of dialog (Baldur's Gate, Morrowind, and more recently Dragon Age and Mass Effect). Fighting is fun but can get repetitious in some games...as it does here. I played this game on Normal difficulty, and since I am not the greatest with real time button mashing, it is quite challenging. Fortunately, you have two computer controlled helpers (or co-op friends) which take some of the pressure off you in fights.

General Comments

I enjoyed this game far more than I expected to. The art style of the environments and the intertwining of the actual events and characters from LotR with your own unique adventure were big positives, overcoming the somewhat repetitious fighting and minimal character customization typical of the Action RPG genre.

I received a new console from Nintendo 1 week after I sent it. I have had it for 3 months and everything works perfectly. In fact, I am writing this on it.

The Wii U is a great console. The setup was nice and easy. I actually managed to get the last one in all of the Gamestops in my area.

I turned on the console, and went quickly through the setup process. Then came the long day one update. It lasted me 1 1/2 hours, but it wasn't that bad. The update finished , and I got on the main menu.

The menu is easy to navigate on the Gamepad, and just awesome looking on the TV. I started by running the mini-updates on all of the apps, which each one took about two minutes. Then, I went and tried out every app. Loading times aren't terrific, but it isn't really a big problem. Nintendo announced that they are going to release an update to quicken up loading times.

The console has great graphics. I used it for streaming Amazon Instant Video, and it streamed in HD with no problem and no lag. The Gamepad also had great graphics. It is also very light and comfortable to hold.

The console worked amazingly until the fourth day. Then, I started getting the blinking red light of death. I tried resetting the adapter many times, but with no luck. Once, it got working, but it froze five minutes into gameplay, and wouldn't turn on again. I called Nintendo customer support, and they told me my console needs to be fixed, so I shipped it out, and am still waiting to get it back. Their customer service is great though. They picked up within a minute, and they gave me $10 eshop credit for having this trouble. But if you are worrying if your console won't work, THIS IS NOT A COMMON PROBLEM.

Overall, I was very impressed with this console while it worked. I would highly reccomend getting this console. It is great for single player and multiplayer use. When compared with the Xbox 360 and the PS3, this console easily comes out on top.","Great console, mine had a bug.",1355011200,4,,

The fourth installment has incredible detail, wonderful graphics, lots to do, and a great replay value. With the addition of religion, leader traits, and a whole new technology tree, Civilization 4 is my absolute favorite next to Simcity 4000. Religion needs some polishing because it seems to be non-important later in the game and seems like its not even there. The only bug is the fact that a archer sometimes can defeat a gunpowder unit which is odd. It reminds me of the Phalanx unit in the previous Civilization where it somehow holds out against a tank.

Basically you are in charge of a civilization (there are many to choose from) and you lead them from the stone age to the space age. You have to create cities, spend your gold pieces wisely on research and happiness, and possibly building projects. These projects outside of buildings such as granaries and barracks are called World of Wonder or a Natonial Wonder. There are loads of wonders between the 2 of them so be careful, you only can build a certain amount of each within each of your cities.  The addition of Great Leaders adds a value to the game that sometimes in other games waters it down and gives you an idea as to who will win. This is not the case. For instance, the Great General can bind your units together and give them expierence points where you can upgrade them. These upgrades can be: strength, extra defense, healing, extra strike, and many others. A Great Artist can give any of your cities a culture boost or give a city a ""shot in the arm,"" which means you can get extra prodiction and/or culture.

With the addidtion of 2 expansions this game went from outstanding to amazing just like that. Some minor bugs have been fixed with the exception of early units defeating more advanced units as I stated above. Anyone complaining about it not being polished and horrible are dead wrong. When this game was released it was incredibly strong and hardly buggy. It's a lot better than most games that are released! I preordered it and recieved it when it was released. I was able to get the box that contained the tech tree and extras that included a Sid Meier interview. Not bad but if you get this edition or the one with no extras, there is no difference in price and its not jaw dropping material.

They compare it to Halo and other FPS's as if it's inferior to them in some way.  They probably said the same about Halo when it first came out.  ""It's alright, but it's no Perfect Dark/Goldeneye.""  In two months they'll be on the bandwagon singing Bioshock praises.  This game is groundbreaking, and don't let the nay-sayers dissuade you.

Originality.  We're getting Halo 3 this month.  I'm as excited as the next guy, with the Legendary Edition and Limited Edition on pre-order (the Legendary version is staying in the wrap).  But it's Halo 3.  I've seen it before.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.  I can't stand the linearity of the CoD series.  I consider the games very uninspired.  Bioshock.  Enter a world that is unlike anything you've ever seen.  Massive levels that you can't stop exploring because you have to see what's in the next room.  The environments never get repetitive, which was one of my biggest concerns entering the game.  Each level has a unique personality that you will remember long after playing through.  The game is haunting with it's utopia-gone-wrong feel.  You know this place was awesome once, and then something went horribly wrong.

I'm not going to spoil any of the story for you.  This game is best played fresh, with no idea what's going on.  Anyone who says it's predictable or boring is full of $#!T.  It's one of the best stories I've seen in a game in the past few years.  And how you play through it will definately have an effect in the end.  The good ending even got me a little teary-eyed.

There is a review that complains about the lack of variety in enemies, saying there are only two types.  These two types are more like categories.  Big Daddies and Splicers.  Splicers are the screwed up citizens of Rapture (who have been doing a lot of bad things) and have modified themselves in different ways.  Spider Splicers, Houdini Splicers, Leadhead Splicers, etc.  They all fight in different ways and require different ways of dealing with.  There are only two types of Big Daddies, but fighting them is something you'll remember for a long time.  They are completely docile until you mess with them.  Then their eyes go red and you feel a nice little poo in your pants as the thing comes raging at you.  It's awesome.  Finding more efficient ways of killing them is even better.

Another complaint is that this game lacks multi-player.  It's true, but who cares.  Resident Evil would suck if it were online and so would this.  Not every game needs (or should have) a multi-player component.

Summing up, picking up this game is a no-brainer.  If you hate the idea of no multiplayer, at least rent it.  You can play through it in 15-20 hours, but I took the time to enjoy it and put about 30 hours in on the first playthrough.  Now I'm playing through it again.

Quick conclusion: get the console version if you can, it's much better and complete. If you want to know more keep reading.

I have played both versions of Dante's Inferno for the home consoles (Xbox 360 in my case) and PSP, and the PSP version is definitively a VERY watered down version, it's not bad, it's a VERY GOOD game and IS the same game than the home consoles (same history, same levels, same phase, same characters, etc.), but the developers removed a lot of features and even some gameplay aspects, maybe because of the hardware limitations of the PSP? Not enough space in the UMD? I don't know.

In the PSP version a lot of things were removed, for example, the ""puzzle"" were you have to move the crate in the Charon boat was removed (along some other little puzzles like this). Other things removed were the mini-game that plays when you absolve a soul, also ALL of the relics were removed (you don't collect relics in the PSP version, just the Silver Coins) and some parts that were playable in the home console version are now converted to video (a video plays showing the action that was playable in the home console).

A lot of sounds were removed too making the PSP version somewhat a bland one in the sound aspect, this is hard to explain but you can notice it if you played the home console version which is richer in sounds of the tormented souls, fire and beast of the inferno; fortunately all the voices from the different characters are intact. In the graphics department I give it credit, some of the best graphics I've seen on the PSP, no complains here. Now for the camera... terrible, I don't know what happened to the camera in the PSP version but I can't see anything, in the middle of a fight the camera is totally useless and I always get beaten by enemies I can't even see because the camera just focus a small portion of the scene, frustrating at times.

It is still a VERY good game, and considering it is PORTABLE and you can play it ANYWHERE makes it totally awesome despite being a version with less features... but this trip to the inferno is much more appreciated in the home console version of the game, that's why this is getting 4 stars.","Excellent game, but go for the home console version if you can",1350000000,7,{'Platform:': ' Sony PSP'},

The pacing is well done in a way that makes the game very linear, but you don't really notice or mind it. There is plenty of hidden content and missable sidequests along the way. The random banter with other students and their hidden storylines makes it very interesting to speak to every npc ever. Whenever anything happens, a shift in day to night, next day, every npc has something new to say, to continue the storyline they live in, and you get little glimpses of it. Combat is very fun, seemingly simple, yet complex at the same time. Fights either go exactly as you plan with flawless execution, or you mess up and end up losing half your party in one turn. I've never had to grind at all through my journey in this game either, so there is no boring level wall to get to the next part of the story. The individual storylines of the main characters in your party are great too, even though the interactions between one another seem forced sometimes. The detail in the environment is amazing, every single zone you visit looks very well done.

For those of us who find games like Oblivion and Fallout 3 to be too open, too wide and too daunting this is a great game.

The story begins simply with a fairly long chapter that eases you into the game without being a boring tutorial. At the end of you will become the first human ""spector"" - a CIA like opporitive charged with tracking a traitor who is threatening the univirse. Once the opening is complete you have a ship and the galaxy is at your disposal, you can roam free and explore, follow side quest in your journal or go on about the main mission. You pick up six party members along the way and can take two at a time, just like with FF, they have to be in your party to earn experience and you have to keep them all armed and have the equipment updated and modified.

Here's the downside, the menu screen sucks. Arming your parting and upgrading and modifying weapons and armor is boring and time consuming. The screen requires you to keep clicking to other screens and then back for each weapon and each mod and each character gets four weapons and 2 mods per plus armor with mods.

The level up is a familular point-distribution that lets you decide were your stronger and when.

The battle is supposed to be complex, it's got RPG style controls that allow you to control your party, but it's clunky and annoying, I just let the npg's do thier thing and worry about the main character -- who can be male or female and decently customized but will always be ""sheppard"" so I made the first name ""German.""

I play this on my tower:
AMD Phenom 64x true-quad core 1.6X4ghz black edition
2 X BFG NVidia GX250 with 2 gig DDR4 with SLI and PhysX
8 Gig NVidia SLI low-latency ram
HT Claro 7.1 sound

I run on all settings high with 60fps @ 900X1400 resolution and have no lag, screen tear or loading times.

I also have this on Xbox 360 -- loading is constant, but fairly quick, screen tears regularly and the graphic quality is inferior. Also, the controls are better suited to all the keys on your keyboard, the XBox controller is frustrating.

It looks, sounds and plays better on a high-end PC so if you have the option don't go X-Box. Also, lots of DRM fixes at the pirate bay dot org.",Better on PC than XBOX 360,1255737600,3,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

The game, in a lot of ways, is very cool. You get to be a samurai and hack people to shreds with many different swords. Also, you can pretty much kill whoever you want and choose which clans you want to fight with or against. You can use deception to get what you want or you can be loyal to one clan. This idea is very cool for a game and I wish more games would utilize it. However, there are many bad points about this game:
First of all, as most people have said on here, the save system is the worst I have ever seen in a video game. It is hands down, terrible. Very sloppy and just plain dumb. Second of all, the camera angles can be unbearable at times. You will be fighting someone and then all of a sudden, oops, you can't see him, or you or anything but a wall or something. Very shotty camera work. This can be overlooked at times, but other times it makes you want to throw your controller through a wall. Also, the graphics leave a little to be desired and sometimes the overall view you get of the game is quite [poor]. Also, the game is quite short.
The gameplay is fun during combat...when you are having swordfights with enemies, it is quite fun to hack them up and develop new moves to fight with. Combine that with the idea behind the game and you get the reasons I gave it 3 stars.

Here's the goods and bads of Halo Wars

The graphics are simple, but they work.  There's really nice lighting effects, shading, dimension, etc.  It works.  It won't win awards, but it works.

The game is SOLID - no lagging, no crashing, even in HUGE conflicts with multiple units running around.  I've never had a single problem, and that's a FIRST for a console RTS.

The controls are easy.  I've never seen a shorter learning curve on a console RTS.  The options stay in the same place with every building or unit.  You quickly get to the point where you can point, click, flick-click and exit out of the menu, and have 100% confidence that what you wanted, you'll get.

Now, the bad stuff...

Halo Wars left out the most important part of an RTS game - the ability to create groups.  A lot of times you end up with critical units - units that MUST survive - for whatever reason.  But you have no way to select just that unit, or MORE IMPORTANTLY, select every unit BUT that unit.  One of my favorite ways to play RTS games is to build fleets of identical size and unit counts.  Each fleet will have everything from infantry to assault vehicles.  I then flank my enemy from multiple directions with these fleets, stretching their resources thin until my three fleets effectively reach ""the middle,"" and wipe out the bad guys.

This strategy simply isn't possible with Halo Wars.  You can do it once - the initial attack.  You'll have to group your fleets in common areas, select the area and issue the command.  Once the groups have begun to spread or mingle with each other, you can't separate them anymore.  How in the world you can build an RTS without the grouping feature is beyond me.

The units are pretty weak - they die easily.  The unit counts are low - too low to support defense strategies with any more than 2 or 3 bases.  The bases themselves are a total dissapointment.  As another reviewer commented, they're ""cookie cutter"" bases.  Each base consists of a central ""hub"" with anywhere from 3 to 7 ""pods"" around it, and you can selet what you want in each pod.  There's no feeling of ""home"" with any base - no pride in your design - and that kills it.

Halo Wars is a flawless interface with a sub-par RTS game.  It's not bad, but it certainly isn't great.",One GLARING omission...,1237334400,4,,

Ghost Recon is a tense FPS type game with high marks for combat tactics and realisim.  The key to playing and winning is ""see the bad guy first"" which is easier said than  done.  The single player game consists of 15 missions in which you control 6 Recon soldiers.  The idea is to accomplish all of  your mission goals. If you can pull this off, no mean feat, the game will open ""specialist"" soldiers that have somewhat better weapons and combat experience (stats) allowing you to ""take"" them along on your next mission.

Well, that's only partially true.

See, while this game is very cool and stylish (with nice cel-shaded graphics and interesting character design, as well as fitting music and sound of acceptable - though not exceptional - quality), and undeniably innovative (the spray paint mechanics are original), it's just not that fun.  Here's why.

When I started playing, I was expecting something far more fast-paced.  But your character moves at a disappointingly-slow speed.  Also, the spray painting system, while fun at first, becomes boring and somewhat irritating.  It's no fun to have to repeat the same actions over and over again, and nothing is worse than being shot at while your in the middle of tagging a building or sidewalk.

I would only recommend this game to someone who was interested in studying its cool and bold art style, or a die-hard SEGA fan, but to everybody else:  borrow it if you have the chance (assuming you have a friend with a Dreamcast).  If you can't borrow it, Just forget about it.","Stylish, But Not That Fun...",1193356800,,,

This game is very age appropriate.  As Dora is walking around the different planets, there are choices for the child to make.  Either walk along the paths or find crystals and other hidden goodies.  This makes it interesting for the kid who's playing instead of just a boring walk here and there.  But it's not too complex that you can get lost.

The game guides you where to go so the player always feels successful and accomplished.  It requires some thinking and problems solving skills where you pick up items and have to figure out where to use them.

My son made it from Earth to the Purple Planet in several sessions which kept him entertained for a while.  The saving feature is very nice so the kids can play for 15 to 20 minutes at a time without having to go back.

The original Still Life and it's unofficial precursor Post Mortem were both strong games with interesting story lines and sensible puzzles (except for the cookie puzzle!!!).  Both of those games also had a supernatural element in them that was done with a very light touch and did not distract from the mystery part of the story.  And in my opinion Still Life's artwork was beautiful, if a little disturbing.  Still Life 2 has none of those finer qualities.  The only positive thing it has going for it is I think the voice actor is the same for the main character (Victoria McPherson) but other than that the game is just a complete disappointment to Still Life fans.

As the previous reviewer remarked, the story line is a mess and at some points unintelligible.  I think Microids originally planned to have Still Life continue online but because of financial/managerial reasons couldn't do it.  I think this is the result, a cobbled together version of an installment game that never quite makes sense (because some installments were cut?) and heads toward a conclusion very, VERY slowly.  The timed puzzles, the multiple character viewpoints, the out of nowhere characters (there is little character interaction, you just learn by reading reports how someone is known to/by Vic) just did not make for a fun or interesting game.

To add to the frustration, the load times were sloooooo[...]  Seriously walking from room to room there was a three second lag between screens...this doesn't sound like a long time until you have to walk from room to room, level to level, searching for something REPEATEDLY.

It's a selection of retro style games within a strange framework.  Anyone familiar with Game Center CX will instantly understand the premise, and all the references said framework provides.  Anyone else might be left scratching their head.

The studio tried very hard to make the title appealing to a wide audience by localizing much of the content, but for a fan of the show it detracts a little.  I was looking forward to hearing the Cheif cheer me on while I played my way through the various challenges.  No matter how you look at it they were in for a tough time selling this quirky game.  With no televised property to tie in with RGC is easily overlooked.

The fact remains, in spite of all of that stuff, that Retro Game Challenge is a lovingly crafted game.  Much more so than most 3rd party games.  Each of the sub games is fully playable, and you unlock them after you complete a certain number of challenges for free play.  Although they are all new games they really do exactly capture the feel of games made in the early days of console gaming.  Nintendo would charge a person $30 for any one of these games if they ported them from the NES, but you get them ALL for much less than that.

The challenges themselves can be quite difficult, especially if there is a type of game you aren't good at.  I got stuck early on in the racing game.  I was never good at that type of game, so it was a battle to complete the second task.  When I finally did it I was relieved, and felt maybe a little more accomplished than I should have.  XD  It very much reminded me of Arino throwing his hands up and celebrating after competing one of his many challenges.

This game was, very unfortunately, overlooked.  The sequel will likely never make it to the US, and that is tragic, because it isn't just one solid game, but a whole stack of them.

First of all, as you'll note others saying, there are issues with the built in battery.  It doesn't charge well (and gets worse very quickly over time.)  More importantly though, it tries to force too much power through at once or shorts out or something, so drains the battery even faster (and getting it even hotter) and even has been reported in some cases to damage chargers (I did not test this much, so can't comment on how true this is or is not.)  In the case of mine, it was already so bad by the time I got it as to make the charger part useless.  It would not even hold enough charge to power the DS for more than a second after the orange light came on before it would quit (and this is even with the DS turned off.)  After some deliberation I decided it wasn't worth trying to send back as I bought this for the grip rather than the charger and simply cut that part off (though if you have the security screwdriver it would be better simply to disable it as that part works very nicely to help hold the DS in place -- despite that it seems to have been intended for that though, my DS seems to stay in well.  If I need an emergency charger, I have a USB charging cable and there are many devices that can power USB devices via a battery.  Now I just use it as a grip.  Which brings me to my second point.

As a grip, it's not so bad.  I wish it were a little thinner in the middle to give the sides more roundness.  Also, it still doesn't perfectly solve the problem that some games can be a little rough on the hands (particularly Mario Kart) so it may not be ideal for everyone (but then it doesn't help that my hands are just the wrong size apparently -- small for an adult, but large for a child.)  I do still get some discomfort from time to time and can see some room for improvement here and there, but, overall it does succeed in making using a DS Lite easier on the hands by a fair margin.  One thing I like is how it uses the stylus holder to help hold the DS in and provides a stylus holder in itself to compensate.  Sadly though, the stylus can be really hard to pull out of the provided holder with this grip which might be a problem in some games requiring one to work quickly.

PS.  Remember people, even lithium ion batteries loose capacity as you use more recharge cycles.  If your DS has been used for a long time, you may just need a new battery more than you need any sort of backup charger.  I would suggest that if you are considering this product, you should consider it more on the merits as a grip than any sort of backup power system.  I do rate it a 3/5 because it has a decent amount of room for improvement as a grip, but overall I feel like it's worth the relatively small amount I spent on it.",Works pretty well as a grip -- bad as a battery,1216857600,,,

Other games, like Mass Effect and Assassin's Creed 2, come close, but no other game combines the overall polish, playability and fun quite so perfectly as Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.

If you read my review of the original Uncharted: Drake's Fortune you will see that I had very high praise for that game as well.  What's amazing, though, is that despite how incredible the first Uncharted was, the sequel betters it in nearly every way.  The gameplay is even more dynamic, with enhanced stealth and traversal mechanics, which gives you more options about how to approach a given combat scenario.  I've had fun trying to beat some sections of the game using nothing but stealth.  Another neat addition to Uncharted 2 is the way so many of the environments you find yourself fighting in are actually dynamically moving under your feet--from moving trains and trucks to crubling buildings--which actually affects your character's movement, as well as your aim.  Many games would handle scenerios like this through cut scenes, but getting to actually play through such moments is exhilarating.

The narrative that weaves through Uncharted 2 is of Hollywood movie caliber.  No, strike that, it's actually better than many Hollywood movies.  The characters have dimension and are entirely believable.  The main characters are so likeable and you can't help but root for Nathan and his friends.  The pacing, both in terms of storytelling and gameplay, is nearly flawless.  It is very hard to put down the controller once you start.

The graphics are also outstanding and are probably the most impressive I have ever seen in a video game.  There is such an amazing attention to detail and the textures, lighting and post-processing effects come together to create an extremely believable world.  The art direction and level design are so great and you find yourself in these immense, beautiful locations that just take your breath away sometimes.

On top of all this, Uncharted 2 brings a full suite of multiplayer modes that were not present in the first game.  And they are really good.  I am a high ranking Uncharted 2 player online and I play the multiplayer modes almost every day.  I've played online with Killzone 2, Gears of War 2, Halo 3, etc, etc and I can honestly say that I find the multi-player portion of Uncharted 2 to be more refined and enjoyable than any of them.  The way you can climb and jump around the levels makes the gameplay very dynamic and fluid--Gears of War 2, for example, feels very clunky and slow in comparison.  Another thing I really like about Uncharted 2 online is the fact that I actually use nearly every weapon in the game, whereas in many online games I mainly stick to one or two weapons.  All of the weapons in Uncharted 2 are really well balanced and they all have their strengths and weaknesses which allow for different strategies.  In a given match I usually find myself switching between about 5 different weapons.  Amazing all around!

In conclusion, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is the full package.  The single player campaign by itself is among the best experiences I have ever had.  The characters, the narrative, the gameplay and the presentation are all a notch above and exude a sense of polish and attention to detail that is simply amazing.  Add on top of that one of the most well-designed multiplayer offerings and you simply can't go wrong with this game.  Naughty Dog, the developer, should be commended.  Uncharted and Uncharted 2 are both in my top 5 favorite games of all time and I can't wait to see what the talented guys and gals at Naughty Dog come up with next.",My favorite game of all time!,1260403200,,,

leave it to microsoft to muckup one of the best games (tried & proven).

the game engine seems jittery and at times, when strafing, you will get negative feedback which causes your character's movement to stutter.

context sensitivity for environment interaction (i.e. doing S.W.A.T. turns--peeling off of cover) are not there when they should be.  Devs missed a lot--when they shouldn't.  trying to aim from cover often results in peeling you off the wall instead.  The blind fire itself, if you're trying to pull compound actions is pretty unpredictable.  It's really watered down the complexity of what a player can do.  For example, wanna pull off a headshot around the corner from cover and then horizontally jump away?  Good luck executing, maybe 2 of the 3 will happen, jumping--not aiming, maybe jumping and pulling of the shot in some random order.  I don't know if it's my connection but at a solid 55mb down and 5 up--I should be good.

Everything multiplayer is sad.  Matchmaking is atrocious and takes terribly-long.  King of the Hill (annex) only lasts 1 round.  Expect about 5 minutes between multiplayer matches (finish-to-next-start).  Oh and if you make it to the finish screen after a match--the screen is locked.  You cannot exit until the next screen loads (maybe 45-60 seconds later).

grenade physics respond as though you're shotputting a 16-lb bowling ball.  Unless you deliberately hold L-trigger to actually bolo throw the grenade--good luck getting it farther than 2-feet from you.  (use at your own peril)

The gnasher seems to be its old self (finally a praise) but hip firing is very deceptive because if you use the direction of the shotgun as an indicator--you will be horribly misled and it's intensely counterintertuitive to fire at the center of the screen--ignoring the direction the muzzle is pointing.

This is my favorite series of all time and I was nothing less than ecstatic to play.  I have all but sworn off video games due to the gloomy and uninspired video game culture that seems to be trending and I was hopeful for this but sorely disappointed with the rerelease.

It is what it is and it's still a lot of fun to play multiplayer sans the looming flaws aforementioned.

It's rare that such a thing occurs with video games, but somehow, Magus manages to do just that.  It's a light RPG/action/hack and slasher in which you play the title character, who is assisted by some chick named Kirra, in a mission of revenge for...something.  The story of Magus is hard to swallow, only because there is some painfully bad voice acting and dialogue peppered throughout the game that you can't help but skip through.  The core gameplay of Magus is run from room to room, area to area, taking down waves of enemies.  In between all that, you acquire various items and gems that make you stronger and level you up, along with some fairly nifty magic abilities as well.  The gameplay itself is kind of boring, yet somehow addictive.

5.0,False,"12 28, 2011",AAQS3N9XPXHWW,B002I0F5M8,J. Lethal,"I really enjoyed Batman: Arkham Asylum so I expected big things here.  Thankfully, Arkham City keeps all the good elements of the first game, makes some improvements, and adds enough new elements that the experience still feels fresh.

The one major downside to Arkham Asylum to me was the need to almost constantly use the X-ray vision mode to see where thugs were lurking around corners in order to plan stealth attacks in relatively small spaces.  This time around, the city environment allows for much greater movement, and the lighting makes it easy to see enemies without going to X-ray mode, while still keeping a dark atmosphere.  Strategy is still needed since some of the bad guys carry guns, but I no longer feel like I'm playing the role of a ninja, taking out one guy and scurrying back into the shadows.  It's very cool to look to the sky and see the bat-signal indicating the direction of your current primary objective.

The number of melee attacks you can unlock is so extensive it felt overwhelming at first.  Fortunately you have the option to have a prompt come up at the bottom of the screen when your combo meter is high enough to use advanced attacks.  The more sophisticated and varied your fighting style, the more XP points you get to unlock more abilities and upgrade your armor.

Then there are the hundreds of Riddler trophies to obtain.  Some are merely hidden from sight, while others are in plain view but require solving a puzzle to free them for collection.  There is even a device that involves chaining letters together to form words to solve some of the riddles.  There are also various challenges like gliding a certain distance, performing certain attacks successfully, and destroying Joker teeth, each of which awards a Riddler trophy.  Just collecting all the trophies is like a game in itself, and is a nice way to break up the action.  Also, you can hold down the L2 button to mark a Riddler trophy on your map if you can't currently retrieve it.  Tip: If there is no evident way to get to a trophy, mark it and move on.  Many require gadgets that you may not have yet, and the red ones can only be obtained by Catwoman.

Catwoman has really nice martial arts attacks, can use her whip and other weapons, and can make repeated jumps to scale a building in place of Batman's grappling hook.  She definitely feels fully developed and in no way tacked on as a promotional gimmick.

Batman's gliding ability combined with being able to grapple from midair makes it easy to get around the city.  It's fun, the physics are well done, and it is practically useful.

The graphics in this game are some of the best I've ever seen.  I never have that sensation like in some sandbox games where the buildings look painted into the background and unrealistic.  It really feels like a living, breathing world, especially since there are always optional side missions popping up and bad guys lurking and chatting about what's going on.  The voice acting is very good, especially Mark Hamill's portrayal of The Joker.

AI in this game is impressive.  If I take out one in a gang with stealth and the others find him, they go on alert and actively search.  This means altering their patrol patterns, staying closer together, and turning around much more often to watch their backs.  It's a refreshing change from games where guys go on alert for a minute, then return to mindlessly walking the exact same path and begging to be picked off.  The game is challenging but never cheap, and if you have trouble with certain elements of fighting you can upgrade accordingly.  The ability to throw down a smoke pellet when coming under gunfire is a great addition.

I don't have a bad thing to say about this game.  I'm not one to go overboard with praise and ignore flaws, but there are no issues here.  No bugs, no collision detection problems, no slowdown despite the huge scale of the city, no painful logic gaps in the story or motivation.  You can tell Rocksteady had a great engine to start with, and spent their time fixing issues and expanding gameplay in creative ways.  Too often I get frustrated during a game and wonder ""didn't the developers care if this is actually fun to play?"".  During the many hours I've spent in Arkham City, I have only asked that once, which was when I was first learning how to glide.  There is no tutorial and I had to go online to figure out how to dive and pull up.  That temporary problem aside, the game is nonstop fun, with enough challenge that I've died numerous times in ways that left me saying ""I need to plan better next time"".  This is the sort of game where you're saying goodbye to months of your life when you pick it up, which you should do right now.",This game lives up to the hype in every way,1325030400,15,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

I only ever rented this game, as it came out way towards the end of the N64 era of video gaming. Nevertheless, it was always an extremely fun game to me and I recently revisited it at a friend's house. Boy, did playing it again bring back memories!

Once upon a time, I would rent this game and play it nonstop. The gameplay is simple yet challenging at the same time, especially once you make it to the optional worlds. Not to mention trying to get the rare pieces of armor in each level is also a fun challenge.

The story: you possess the elemental stone of fire and are on your way home from a long vacation to a hot springs planets where you found a curious looking egg.  Suddenly, a black hole sucks you in and you wake up in a jail cell. The egg hatches to introduce Pommy, who evolves throughout the game based on the food you obtain by killing enemies and destroying boxes. You begin to meet various Elemental Knights (one of which is VERY familiar to fans of the first BM64 game, but I won't spoil it) and a mysterious woman named Lillith. Together with Lillith you attempt to stop an insidious plot to revive a god and, at the same time, destroy the black hole and get home.

The story is excellent, but what was the one problem with the game? It's way too easy to die, especially when you reach the amusement park world and encounter a puzzle with spikes that are incredibly easy to touch and will kill you on impact. And also, unlike many games, the final boss is incredibly difficult. This may give kids who thinks ""It's an E game, so it's easy"" a rough time. The last uber annoyance may be the save feature. You need to beat a level to save. Otherwise you must restart the level, which can be an absolute pain on the last three levels especially.

Final word: All in all I must say that this is one of my favorite games of all time and I spent hours and hours of game time (and then some). Therefore, I am proud to give this game a 4.75 star rating in the fun factor. However, due to the problems that may give players a bit of difficulty, overall, I give it 3.5 stars.",Pommy!,1159315200,2,,

Some say that the original Metal Gear Solid revolutionized the way videogames are viewed. Here is the third in this amazing series and though I beat it well over a year ago, here is my review.

In Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, rival nations are secretly developing weapons that could threaten the future of mankind. Deep in the jungle, an elite tactical soldier must combine stealth with survival to infiltrate the enemy and stop a weapon of mass destruction from triggering the largest full-scale war the world has ever seen. The game is set in a sweltering jungle where players must fight for survival by battling relentless natural elements, as well as an onslaught of ruthless enemy soldiers. In my opinion, the story is the best aspect of the game. It is such an amazing, emotional rollercoaster ride that does not let up till the credits are completely over. I mean, this game takes real events and interweaves its own fictional story through them while keeping all the events true to history (it takes place in 1964 as most of you well know). The characters in this game are just simply amazing. They feel like real people. Throughout the game you come to care about these characters, more so than in any other videogames I've ever seen. Without spoiling anything for those who haven't played this yet (shame on you) at the end of the game at the last boss battle there is this one character who you just want to kill. They have been nothing but a pain and all you want to do at that point is kill them. But, in true Kojima fashion, the battle doesn't start right away. No no, that character gives a speech. A speech that makes you literally, no lie here, go from hating them to realizing how awesome and great of a person/character they are and not want to kill them. And when you finally do kill them, it tears you up inside. Of course, through the end cut scene (which in my opinion is the best ending and cut scene ever in a videogame) you learn more about this character and why they did what they did and you care even more about them, even though they are dead. And the final shot in the game is a tearjerker. If you care about these characters, feel for them what they had to go through and were wrapped up in the story, you probably will cry. I did and it's just that good. That's a testament to the brilliance of Kojima. He can make you care about a character that isn't even real.

The graphics in this game are just phenomenal. Everything is richly textured and is stunning to look at. The character models are gorgeous. Especially the facial expressions, those are damn impressive. Everything is extremely fluid in the way things move; the mo-cap was used very well in the creation of this game. Everyone moves so lifelike, it is scary sometimes cause you actually feel like these are real people. All the environments look realistic, like they could exist in real life and vary in each section you go to. You never once feel like ""I was just through here!"" (Unless you in fact do go back in that area).

The sound is simply amazing as well. The score by Harry-Gregson Williams is extremely powerful and riveting. The music is very catchy and goes absolutely perfect with the game. I myself enjoyed the Theme Song a lot, it was a nice play on the 007 themes and is actually a cool song, it's on my iPod. The sound effects in are second to none. The guns sound like they should and the environmental sounds are just great. More than once you'll just stop and listen to the sounds of the jungle. And if you play it with surround sounds, you actually feel like you are there. All the animals sound realistic as well. The voice acting is superb as usual. As always, it's a huge leap above other games. David Hayter returns as Snake and does a superb job as always. Suzetta Mi?et is EVA and is good too. Jim Piddock voices Major Zero and is fantastic. Neil Ross and Josh Keaton play Volgin and Ocelot, respectively and Gregg Berger, Michael Bell, J. Grant Albrecht, Richard Doyle and David Thomas (no, not the Wendy's guy) voice the bosses The Pain, The Fear, The End, The Fury and The Sorrow, all respectively of course). A standout though is Lori Alan who voices The Boss. She adds something to the character. Something tough to put into words. If you play it you'll know. She does an exceptional job. The script is very tight and extremely well written with great dialogue and the amazing quotes are still here.

The gameplay is smooth and responsive. It controls nicely and the new features are cool. CQC is a blast to use. There are many different things you can do to the enemies. The camouflage works well and is fun to use. The survival aspect never gets in the way and adds another fun challenge and angle to this game.

Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is the best game I have ever played. Period. It is a true masterpiece and honestly, I can only hope Guns of The Patriots annihilates it because if you can improve on MGS3, then you have one hell of a game. This game is nothing short of a masterpiece.","Tactical Espionage Action. I call it, Simply Amazing!",1145232000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

So reading the reviews REALLY made me question whether to wasted my time on 'Andromeda' at all. Finally though, used copies are now on sale for $12, and how could I pass that up?

And now after about 3 weeks and 38% completion of the game so far, I can say; I can't understand what all the bad reviews from previous ME players is all about. It's absolutely a Mass Effect game, with all the same flaws all the previous ones had - so fans should be used to it by now. YES the character animation and rendering is pretty bad, and everyone walks and stands like they have large sticks in their butts - there's very little 'next gen' animation in the game. But I remember thinking that about the other ME games too, that they didn't 'stretch' the XBOX 360 abilities. So that's the same. Yes the combat is pretty much the same, which is not great. Yes the new aliens are still not aliens, even in a whole new galaxy - aliens are still just humans with funny heads, and have the exact same personalities, emotions, and motivations as humans. There's even a Turian female who sounds just like a human teenager! So that's still the same.

The main story itself is fairly interesting (although silly - I still don't get the point of traveling all the way to a new galaxy to start new colonies), and so far there seem to be a thousand side stories and side quests, which for me is a main selling point of games. I like to have a lot to do, and many of the side quests are very involving stories. As I've said, I'm over 3 weeks in and only have 38% completion! That's getting your money's worth.

The designers have also put in 'Research and Development', resource gathering, and kinda/sorta settlement building, which I hated in Fallout 4 and I""m not a fan of here either. I wish they would have put that time and effort into making the 'non-explorable' planets and solar systems more interesting, instead of 'scan this planet and find nothing oh well'. The research and building of armor, mods, and weapons can be pretty confusing as there's no way to tell which races equipment will be better until after you actually build them and compare, which leads to a lot of wasted resources.

And you still spend a HELLACIOUS amount of time driving around on a planet's surface, although the new NOMAD is much better than the old MAKO, which was so awful that I almost quit a couple of the previous games just so I wouldn't have to drive that monstrosity anymore. So saying the NOMAD is better, is really damning it with faint praise. It's not even armed, so you can't use it in any firefight.

The planets you visit are actually very nicely designed for the most part, with thought out ecologies and much better looking than the humans/aliens, and have 'fast travel' points to make it easier to get around - as some of those planetscapes are pretty big.

All in all if you're a Mass Effect player, the game is very similar to what you've played before, which can be either a plus or minus for you. For new players, try it with an open mind and see - it's long and involved and there's a lot to do, and if you don't have the patience for that, it won't be your thing. Also if you're looking for fantastic visuals, it also may not be your thing. For me so far the positives outweigh the negatives - if I could give it 3 1/2 stars I would, but I'll bump it up to 4 for the complexity.","Not nearly as good as you'd hope, but not nearly as bad as you've heard",1509753600,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

I was utterly shocked at how indescribably boring Disega was. It is just a giant grind fest with annoyingly tricky camera angles and somewhat interesting characters.

The story feels like it was made for 10 year oldswhich is fine, except the people who recommend this game are in their late teens/20s.

The gameplay is unique, but the controls feel tedious and taxing. Why would you need to click Execute to attack? Why not just press attacklike every other game in existence?  And why doesnt the left button move the cursor left?! This was soooo annoying! You click up and the pointer goes to the left, and left moves you down. How did they screw up this basic function!

Its not difficult by any meansits just grindy. Really, really grindy. Put that on top of an uninspired combat-system and I was sick of it by the time my 4th hour of gameplay rolled around. I can think of a dozen better JRPG games for the DS and all of them are far more fun.

Roberts,"In Iraq we found that even a Superpower can be crippled by an insurgency led by a dedicated group that is far less technologically advanced than ourselves.  In the present video game, the tables are turned.  The game operates in an alternative reality where a North Korean company became a leading defense contractor back in the 1970s.  The U.S. gobbled up their hardware and kept buying more stuff.  Eventually, the U.S. got to $30 trillion in debt and defaulted on its bills.  The North Korean company then flipped a ""back door"" switch which disabled all of our military technology & hardware.  This left us vulnerable to an invasion ~ which is precisely what North Korea did.

Naturally, there is a low-tech resistance group that uses guile and deception against an enemy that is technologically superior.  Your character is a member of this resistance.  While defeating the North Koreans is something of an impossible task, the ultimate goal is to inflict such a heavy price on their occupation that they will choose to withdraw (similar to what happened to us in Iraq).

This game had a lot of promise & potential.  Conceptually, it is an interesting video game playground.  The main problem with the game lies in its playability.  When you sneak up behind a bad guy, it should not be as complicated as it is to simply take them out.  Most video games of this sort allow you to pause while you switch weapons.  In this game you have to do it ""on the fly.""  Sometimes the button skips and you get the wrong weapon, which is frustrating.  However, the single most annoying feature of the game is that you must fully reload a shotgun B4 using it.  Countless times my character would be nonchalantly reloading the shotgun while getting blasted by a bad guy.  Every other game of this sort that I've ever played has allowed you to reload the shells and fire w/out reloading the weapon all the way.

If you like the CALL OF DUTY series then you may find interest in this one.  It is not as good as COD but there are some fun missions behind-enemy-lines that you can get sent on in this one.",Defending against North Korea,1498694400,2,,

From discovering the hobby with buying Dungeons and Dragons at a garage sale to playing Ultima 3 on my C-64. Role playing games allow us an escape from everyday life. Now NIS (the creator of the Disgaea series) have created a new series called The Guided Fate Paradox. But is this a journey that you will want to go on or should you just stay home?

The plot behind The Guided Fate Paradox centers around a 17 year old named Renya. He goes on to say that he is very unlucky and has never won anything in his life. While in a mall he comes across a cute girl in a maid outfit. She coerces him to spin the wheel as he might win a prize and he eventually does so. It turns out he has won the grand prize and the prize is that he is to become God. Renya is stunned and at first doesnt believe her but it turns out she is an angel named Liliel. The angel transports him to Celestia and explains that his job is to alter the fates of the people that pray to him.

What Renya has to do is enter the Fate Revolution Circuit and explore the areas within. In these dungeons various monsters manifest as the persons fears and slaying these monsters help them overcome these doubts. This is one of the most interesting concepts I have ever seen in an RPG and the story is very engaging with cutscenes and great voice acting.

The dungeons that you enter are randomly generated almost giving you a rogue-like experience. Each time you enter a dungeon you will encounter different enemies, various traps and gimmicks that can hinder your progress. Unlike other games where the action occurs in real time this is a turn based game. Nothing will happen unless you move and you can get the jump on some enemies attacking them before they can even see you.

You will not be going alone in the dungeon however as you can have one angel accompany on your expedition. Each of these angels has various powers and can turn the tide of battle. There are also various items you can find in the dungeon that you can equip or give to one of your angels. Later on there are huge boss battles that will require you to think and plan out your actions to beat these superior foes.

...but briefly: I loved Uncharted, and I own Uncharted 2, both great...Uncharted 3 just doesn't have the drama that those two games had, but it does have some great moments of gameplay.

  On to the system: I bought this, because I like portability. I got the PS3, soon after it came out (but, not soon enough to get one of the PS2 backwards compatible ones). Obviously, this system is smaller, and much lighter.
  Another thing I disliked about my first PS3: the noise. My PS3 is my whole entertainment system, for my bedroom; I hated watching a film, or listening to music, and hearing the loud fan noise, especially when the fan boosted to compensate for the heat. This system is so quiet that I unplugged it, because I thought it was already off (and my head was about 6"" away).

  There are design improvements: The system doesn't get as hot, and there are less air vents (and better designed). So, dust isn't as big of a problem, with the slim. The matte finish isn't the fingerprint leech that its predecessor was (and if you purchase a vinyl skin, you'll have even less to worry about). ...and, if you're interested in upgrading the hard drive, the PS3 slim's drive is much easier to remove.

  Usually, I don't hear any noise from the system, and my room is quiet enough for me to notice. In fact, my MacBook is louder than the PS3 Slim. Occasionally, I do hear the drive scanning/loading a disk, but I haven't noticed any change in performance, going from an 80GB PS3 fat, to the 320GB PS3 slim.

- Fun game
- VATS is something new for gaming.
- Open world with a lot to do (more than almost any other non-Bethesda game).
- Bethesda is a top developer. Todd Howard seems to be a great guy.
- A lot more voice acting than in prior Bethesda releases.
- Controls. Bethesda has the greatest view/camera system in the industry in my opinion. Simply click a button and you're in 1st person, click again you're in 3rd person -- all games should do this in my opinion -- it should be standard.

NEUTRAL
- Bobblehead. meh.
- Far less glitching and bugs than Oblivion. Oblivion had far fewer than Morrowind. Thus Bethesda is getting better and better at debugging.

CONS
- Pip-Boy is a poorly designed battery killer.
- Graphics and animation have unfortunately not been improved since the time of Oblivion. This was a key disappointment to me. I know everything is supposed to look run-down and devastated, but that doesn't mean it has to look graphically mediocre.

IS THIS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER OBLIVION?
- Not for me no.

IS THIS JUST OBLIVION WITH GUNS?
- Some will so no, some say yes. I say YES. It's little more than a re-skinned Oblivion with guns + VATS...and to that I say ""fine by me"".

- PC/360 get DLC so stick with those. PC if you prefer mouse. I prefer joystick, so 360 for me. Definitely do NOT buy the Amazon Exclusive Edition.

3) The stupid jeep thing. There's no map, so you can wander forever.  Can you get out and walk?  In FarCry 4 you'd be a fool to walk cause it would take forever in the massive map.  But here? The Jeep only goes a few meters before you have to stop, but you can't walk.  The jeep is here more of a cumbersome frustrating tool that you have to work around, not as a viable part of the game.  And for those who said that Uncharted 2 was not as great as 4 because of the ski-doos, I say those ski-doos were much more manageable than the jeep, and the story was even more fun.
4)Weapons?  Yes there are tons of different pistols and assault weapons hanging around--and the fight at the end (won't give that away). But in TR-DE you have bows and shotguns besides those in Uncharted, and napalm arrows.
5) Story--the end makes no sense--in two respects.  In terms of the one that got away and the gold.
I will recommend this game to somebody who is patient and likes to listen to good storytelling, but if you want a game that clicks from start to finish, I'd recommend Tomb Raider --Definitive over this one, and Uncharted 1 to 3 as the best of all.","No, this is a 3-star game.",1493769600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",
5.0,False,"11 16, 2003",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B00008G7MM,Lisa Shea,"RPG Maker 2 for the PS2 brings 3D adventure creation to the consoles. A great improvement over RPG Maker, the depth of games you can create with this is staggering.
First, if you haven't tried RPG Maker, the original, that is a simple 2-D adventure maker that could make games such as Final Fantasy 1 and 2. You had little 'wizards' and 'warriors' and such moving up, down, left and right through towns, dungeons, castles and forests. You could have simple dialogue, music and events. This might be a good starting system for someone very new to game creation, to help them learn in a very simple manner.
RPG Maker 2 launches into full 3 dimensional adventures, so you have to be able to think more seriously about the layout of your games. Instead of just having a ""flat world"" that you move through, you literally take blocks and create a 3D world, with stairs up to higher levels, hidden rooms, and much more. You can change the texture of every block, making giant cathedrals, small village huts, wooden bridges, and just about anything you can imagine.
You can connect a USB keyboard to type in long descriptions, and your choices of graphics, sounds and events are much more intense. As you might imagine, you can therefore take MONTHS and months to create huge adventure worlds. The tools are all there, but it takes a little while to get used to how they work, as with any new design system.
When your game is done, save it onto a memory card and trade it off to friends. This could be the perfect way to learn about game design and create something that others are willing to pay to play!
Highly recommended for aspiring game designers who are good with logic and complex design. I'd still recommend the original RPG Maker for younger kids who need to learn the 2D basics first.",Great Way to Learn How to Create Games,1068940800,40,,

It is a shooter, but do not expect something like Halo, because if you are aggressive in this game, you will die. It is a smarter game that requires more waiting and thinking. The controls are more difficult and the bullets are more deadly. It is also a squad-based game, but unfortunately, you will find some artificial intelligence issues with your other squad mambers. They too often kill themselves by not hiding or shooting, and unless you are constantly on top of their actions, which is undesireable, you run the risk of having them killed.

The first thing you will notice whie playing this game is that the graphics are absolutely beautiful. The graphics make this game very impressive, but unfortunatly, gameplay isn't as impressive. Sure, gameplay is good, but single player gameplay will not keep you coming back for more than one or two times.

Multiplayer on the other hand is great. That is, if you don't run into problems. There are many glitches that you will find online, and getting into a game session is painful, especially when you wait for over 10 mins to enter a game just to be thrown out after 10 seconds. This happened to me way too many times for me to over-look it. Also, offline miltiplayer is boring, uninteresting, and not fun.

So if you can over-look dificult controls, not-so-perfect gameplay, and a problem filled multiplayer feature, then you will find a game that has stunning graphics, and gameplay that will still bring you joy.

I enjoyed having to pick which cover to hide in and having to sneak up to the cover. It was also kind of a learning experience for me learning about where exactly to shot the animals to more humanely kill them. It was kind of tricky the first few times trying to get past the mountain lion. You really have to pound the heck out of the controller on tbe exact buttons it tells you to and then you have to immediately find the cat, aim and shoot straight. It was fun. I also liked the little bonus challenges like shooting the ducks and foxes.

The only thing that I didn't like was on the very last challenge. On the very last challenge you will have 2 cougars coming at you. I could never kill them. On that hunt it was too hard to see the cats. They will immediately come down from the hill/cliff they are on and the game won't let you aim at them until after they've jumped onto you. I mean, what hunter would not already be shooting if 2 dangerous cats where running at him or her??? Then after they have jumped onto you and you fight them off, it's nearly impossible to find them as they run behind you, in front of you, then to the side, so fast that it made it nearly impossible to take a good aim at them.
We don't have the gun (I'm not sure this would make a difference) with this and it was way too hard to find the cats as they moved too fast to take aim during the last challenge. I have to agree with my husband that the controller movement is awkward during the dangerous hunts, especially on the last hunt.

5.0,False,"01 31, 2012",A3R9NUZTNBPDNZ,B003O6EBRA,Athlete,"FF XIII-2 continues three years after the first game left off. You assume the role of Serah, who now lives on a settlement on Gran Pulse. She's recently been having dreams where her big sister (and FF XIII main heroine) Lightning fights a mysterious foe in a place called Valhalla. She wakes up one night to discover that a meteorite has crashed down nearby, bringing with it a boy, Noel, who claims to be the last survivor of humanity from a far future. Noel has met with Lightning and was sent to Serah, he says, because the two of them must take a time-travelling adventure to unwind a paradox-filled history -- and that's exactly what they do.

The time-travel element may remind some players of Square classic Chrono Trigger, and the comparison isn't terribly far off. Serah and Noel hop around different eras and locations in the world's history, solving problems and opening portals to other eras and potential futures. Though parts of the story are still linear, you're given far more freedom to approach challenges in a way you personally enjoy. Don't feel like advancing the main plot at this time? Boss fight giving you trouble? Just hop to a different time period to explore and build strength for a while until you're content. Unlike the ""series of tubes"" that comprised most of FF XIII's structure up until later in the game, FF XIII-2 lets you progress at your own pace. With that freedom comes the sense of excitement and discovery that FF XIII sorely lacked, as finding hidden treasures and using clever strategy to topple monsters well above your strength level feels immensely satisfying. And if you ever feel like you might have missed something, you can rewind back to the beginning of certain event sequences to do things over while retaining your hard-earned rewards.

Not everything here is new, however. You'll see a lot of familiar locales, tunes, and designs from FF XIII peppered in-between all-new content. The recycling of some assets can be easily forgiven, however, when what's being reused was beautiful and well-made to begin with. Also returning is FF XIII's superb, fast-paced combat engine and the accompanying Crystarium leveling system, albeit with some significant overhauls. You now have more control over character development, as you can choose to level up specific Paradigm roles on the Crystarium board (as in FF XIII) while also unlocking additional roles and bonus boosts (stat gains, accessory capacity) after reaching certain levels. Moreover, battles continue on even after the initial player-controlled party leader has fallen, giving you a chance to regroup and make a comeback.

It's easy to see how Square Enix took the feedback from FF XIII and used it to make a better product, but this follow-up still has some lingering issues. Every so often you'll encounter an obnoxious gimmick sequence, such as a giant time-jumping fetch quest, a series of out-of-place logic puzzles, or constantly regenerating and unavoidable Cie'th enemy hordes chasing you throughout a massive maze. Plus, the story falters at times, falling victim to leaps of logic and silliness, and dialogue exchanges often feel like characters are simply talking at each other rather than truly interacting. The trademark Square Enix CG is sparse, with most story sequences rendered in-engine. But perhaps most annoying are the technical issues: framerates drop precipitously when a lot is happening onscreen, and this sequel's few movie sequences frequently suffer from hideously artifacted compression.

Maybe the best way to sum up Final Fantasy XIII-2 is with an oft-repeated line of dialogue from the game itself: ""Change the future to change the past."" It's not just a paradoxical plot point: FFXIII-2 repairs almost every problem with Final Fantasy XIII, delivering an experience that feels like what that original game should have been. If your faith in Final Fantasy has been damaged by past disappointment, playing FFXIII-2 will restore your excitement for the franchise's future.",Great Sequel,1327968000,38,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,True,"02 28, 2014",A26N27LJVQNVI1,B00CXI0BPG,Crank,"What a beautiful mouse. Has everything you will ever need for the average user. This isn't an MMO mouse or anything so don't expect myriad buttons and access to those kinds of features. It does have an extensive macro system though, and the features on the new firmware are pretty decent for this price range. At any rate mouse enthusiasts usually know what their mouses are for.

The side pads as many have said have a sweet feeling sandpaper-like compound... BUT this doesn't last as long as one would like for the thumb position IF you use the mouse a lot. MANY mice today use that decrepit shiny and sticky plastic for where your thumb/pinky finger goes...

The feeling after this compound wears down is akin to a slightly stickier plastic. The plastic itself is hard enough so the feeling is never too annoying; I must stress how important this is, because a soft and sticky plastic for my thumb and other fingers will have me wanting to throw the mouse away nearly immediately. I wish the normal sandpaper feel had been able to keep itself for at least 6 months. But this is still much better than my last mouse in feel and touch. I love the overall design of it.  I'm just grateful they didn't go with that nasty, shiny stuff CM used on my Havoc.

Anyway, I updated firmware and installed software in 2 minutes. While not quite the extensive system of options that CM has, this mouse for the time being has topped my old Havoc which had the aforementioned sticky plastic problem requiring tape. Otherwise I think CM's software is better and allows a lot more functionality with LEDs and a couple other things. What is there is pretty decent and you can tune each axis on the pad and have three different slots for DPI, easily reachable below the scroll wheel. A single, small and red LED light is for the first slot and this goes to three lights. They are pretty low key and not too bright. I shut off the Corsair logo as it was too bright and annoying for my tastes.

I am not sure what the native specs are on the DPI sensor but I use about 900-1200 on my desktop and it feels about perfect. I certainly don't need much higher. My PC gaming is mostly done with a controller, but scrolling and clicking buttons works great for the games that need it.

As with every mouse make sure it fits your hand. I feel I can put my palm into if I want or just basically finger touch it and the control and ease with how this mouse glides makes mousing fun again (I have been using some dimestore version for the past 10 days). They have a nice supplement of weights if you choose to lower what they have at the factory. I don't mind it right out of the box. Others will want to take a weight or two out.

I didn't like that they made X the trigger for main attack instead of R1. WHY WHY  WHY? You can't change that until you are level 19. I also didn't like the aiming system for ranged characters. They made the R joystick an evade option (roll, I rarely used it) so there isn't any aim or look function. You aim by moving your body and it is awkward.

What sets this game apart, however, is the overwhelming sense of dread it instills in you pretty much from the onset of the game.  The anticipation of something utterly creepy around every corner is as much an ""enemy"" as any of the numerous Replica soldiers encountered throughout the game; in some ways, it is even worse.  The horror aspect of F.E.A.R. is well done and, even better, tightly-woven into the plot of the game, not merely tacked on for its own sake.  Also, the way the story is presented--through voice mail, data on laptops, and dreamlike visions your character has periodically--allow it to unfold in a way that seems natural and unforced.

The weapons are pretty much standard for the genre, my favorite (by far) being the Particle weapon--one shot kills and what it does to human targets the reasons.  But the real skill weapons are the various grenades and mines you have at your disposal.  Blowing up enemies with a well-placed proximity mine is more satisfying than unloading a full clip from a machine gun into them (although this is pretty satisfying too).

Perhaps it is my style of play, but I found the melee and slow motion features to be pretty much useless.  Since most enemies know you are there almost immediately upon entering a room (stealth is not a strong component of this game) you are rarely in melee range.  And I cannot think of a single encounter that necessitated the use of slow motion, and quite frankly, I forgot it was available most of the time.

But combat is exciting and certain situations are downright memorable.  Using cover and leaning out to get a few shots off are essential against the good enemy AI--they will attempt to keep you stationary with suppression fire while a member of the squad flanks you; flush you out with a grenade; and call for backup when needed.  Some fights are indeed a challenge, but never to the point of frustration.

As has been stated a million times, the graphics are superb.  Through the amount of detail in every area--from trash strewn about to various items on desks to lights blinking on computer and lab equipment--the designers have certainly done a great job of creating a believable, realistic game world.  More variety in environments would have been nice, but what has been provided is excellent quality.  I am fortunate to have a video card that allows me to play the game with all settings maxed and get a good frame rate; the result is a world that had me as immersed as any since Far Cry (the only thing that shattered the illusion was the fan on my video card as it throttled up repeatedly while playing ;-))

Perhaps for all of its good points, the game seems a bit too short.  I bought it on a Saturday and completed it on Medium difficulty on Monday, and this was with moderate playing, never more than an hour or so at one sitting.  I promptly played through single player again, paying more attention to the small details and enjoyed it as much the second time.  That said, there is not much more I can get out of the game since multiplayer FPS doesn't interest me.

So, for a brief, intense space of time F.E.A.R. will draw you into its world, hold you there, and then breathlessly spit you out.  Defintely worth playing but it will leave you wanting more.","Chilling, atmospheric game but a short-lived experience",1138147200,,,

I also enjoy playing Draft Team for a different gameplay experience.

Open Practice, Solo Challenges (where you pick up coins if you win...) and Skills Trainers are essential for new players to gain both insights into the game and to build their gaming skills in Madden 17.  The ability to go head-to-head with other players online is fun IF you get an opponent who doesn't pause gameplay all the time and you both have a solid internet connection. I have not played Franchise mode.

Visually this game is very good (Madden 18 is better).  Sometimes during gameplay, I've encountered a few glitches with the downloaded game (not the disc) whereby things get 'stuck'.  With both the disc and downloaded versions it's not uncommon for players to walk through each other following a play.  Odd, since during the down they were crashing into one another.  It's not a big deal, but noticeable.

Gameplay is fun and once you get the basics there's still a lot you can learn to improve and enhance it.  YouTube has a lot of videos related to playbooks used in Madden 17 that are worth a look, and MutHead forums and comparisons (for players) are also helpful.

While the game is not 'perfect' it's definitely fun and one of my favorites for Xbox.

2.0,False,"09 1, 2004",A3PVM541IR8EYE,B000271MCG,Doug Urquhart,"Other reviewers have described the premise, so I won't repeat it. The game is a multi-stage puzzle - a series of little shockwave games - some verbal, some visual, some involving a certain amount of dexterity (not a lot, fortunately). The games are infuriating at times, but given that their author is supposed to be a serial killer, one must make allowances.

The idea of searching the web for clues, and receiving emails from other 'participants' is quite innovative, and adds to the immersion. Since the game has been published in Europe for some time, though, the searches also uncover walkthroughs. Bit of a temptation, that.

The production values are excellent - the video sections are slick, with lots of very photogenic European locations, the acting is good, and the overall design is spot on. the story is compelling and the characters are sympathetic.

For the most part, I enjoyed this game.

So why the 2-star rating? Some annoying technical issues and a lousy ending.

First, the technical issues:

-  When you first play the game, you have to log on,  using a user name you created yourself plus a password assigned by the game. Better write this on a piece of paper because you'll need it every time you play. Don't these people know about cookies?

-  You can't save the game - it decides on the restart point. It isn't always where you would like to restart.

-  The game is supposed to integrate with your email client. Mine didn't - I use Eudora, and it fixated on Outlook Express(which then tried to take over, the way it does). I had to work around this by loading my email client before running the game. This is important because emails often contain clues.

-  The game was a CPU hog. When it was running, other applications didn't get a look in. Since the whole point of the game is that it coexists with a web browser and email client, this isn't good. A workaround is to use the XP task manager to drop the priority of the task 'missing.exe'. Maybe it's part of the game:).

And as for the ending......(No spoilers, don't worry). Imagine that you've spent several hours working towards the denouement. At the very last minute, the screen goes blank and your only way of finding out what is going on is to wait for emails from the eye witnesses. These come in over a period of time. It's either designed to heighten suspense or the developers ran out of money.

It's a shame how this game turned out: at the beginning, I really liked it.

Oh well.

Granted, Seattle looks absolutely gorgeous. Flying around the city admiring the structures and pummeling foes is fun in short bursts. Once you begin to realize how lifeless the city is, the immersion is lost for good.

In a game like this where neither the atmosphere nor gameplay succeed story becomes incredibly important. Unfortunately, what's here is forgettable.

This expansion of NWN2 takes a game that was ""cinematic"" in look and feel along the lines of KoTOR or Mass Effect, and brings it back to old CRPG roots of random encounters and more generic towns.  And I say old CRPG because old pen & paper RPGs rarely let a single player control 5 entirely self-created characters by himself.  Even games like Baldur's Gate (or later Ultimas) had the pre-created characters with their built-in personalities.

Very old-school CRPGs on early 1980's computers let you create a full roster of characters of your own liking without imposing pre-created characters (like Minsc or Khelgar) onto you.  And in this way, Storm of Zehir is very much like those old CRPGs in a way I've missed in most games aside from Spiderweb Software type titles.

I can see how SoZ would be the perfect platform for making original content creation much easier, as it was with the original Neverwinter Nights.

The problem with NWN2 in the past was that there were so many classes and prestige classes that you could never take advantage of unless you were to play the game all over again.  With SoZ I was able to shoot for many different prestige classes all within my generic party.

The trade system adds new flavor that builds on the Knight Commander's ""mini game"" at Crossroads Keep from the original, but I'm not sure how well it would translate to use in other fan-created content, and it can be a tad annoying at times to run across the map avoiding deadly encounters and not get one bar of ore needed to complete a quest plot line.

On the down side, the Inns are a little TOO generic, and does every town need a Temple of Waukeen?  Aren't there several dozen deities to choose from in the Forgotten Realms setting?

I would have preferred it if the Inns and Temples at least had a few more original personalities in each to talk to.  Even the old Ultima III game of the early 80's had unique taverns in each town.  Which is why I mention ""Phantasie"" --- in many ways Storm of Zehir is like a return to that sort of gaming.

This will appeal to people who love playing D&D just to mess around with  stats and build great characters -- and for those who realize that ""role playing"" is often secondary to enjoying the mechanics and strategy of role playing games, or at least does not need to be limited to a single character and ample cut-scenes.","A different sort of game altogether, appealing to old-school CRPG fans",1241049600,,,

One of my favorite features is that you can unlock the ability to race as one of your Mii characters!! It's about darn time Nintendo!! The Mii feature is a very fun aspect of the Wii, but has been completely underutilized - so I was quite pleased by this addition.

Another great feature is the ONLINE PLAY - while the loading time can feel like forever (and they need to work out the friend kinks, as it took my friend and I THREE DAYS to network together) this is a very exciting feature. Being able to race strangers worldwide is very exciting - but I do wish there was an option to invite players you race randomly, but have fun racing with, into your ""Friends"" network.

One poor feature for me and my friends is the Wii Wheel - The Wheel is VERY hard to control, it works, and I imagine it'd be fun for casual gamers - but to really race some of the harder legs, its too unreliable. The remote and nunchuck are surely the way to play this title.

The unlockable characters, karts and motorcycles are great - but I do wish they could have fit in a few more  levels. The retro-levels are awesome, more please! Same with the weapons, the new ones are fun, but they surely could have included a few more.

I purchased 'Fate: Jewel Case edition' believing I was purchasing Fate, Fate 2 (Undiscovered Reality) and Fate 3 (The Traitor Soul).  It arrived on time and in good condition.

I'm running the game on Windows 7.  When I attempted to load and install the game my computer had a difficult time reading the disk.  I eventually needed to resort to opening the game manually through Windows Explorer.  Although the load was very slow, the game loaded successfully.

At first look after installation it appeared I only had access to Fate 3 (The Traitor Soul).  I became a touch irritated.  Through the search process of looking for the first two Fate games I loaded a game storage site called ""Wild Tangent,"" a site where an individual can pay and play older games.  Fate was there as was Fate 2 (Undiscovered Reality) however, there was a charge to play either of the games, which between the two would have cost more than double what I paid for the Jewel Case edition of Fate.  Now I am more than irritated.  I figure its time to send a very nasty note to the folks I purchased the game from and I headed back to Amazon to let them know my feelings in very clear and concise words.  Luckily for me, I didn't get that far.

I choose to read through the reviews before giving in to my injured sense of fairness in the market place.  First I read all the reviews of those who rated the game a 1.  With a couple of exceptions in which the reviewer just wanted to hear him/herself rant, the reviewers experienced the same issue I did.  I was feeling proud of myself now knowing I wasn't alone.  However, there was a slight dent in my personal feelings of belonging to a disgruntled crowd. . . There were a whole lot more folks who rated the game 5 stars.  Why that was, I decided I needed to find out.

The first Five Star rating I read was written by Oddlydrawn.  He explained how Fate 3 (The Traitor Soul) contains within itself the other two games, as Fate 2 and 3 were expansions to the original Fate.

So good reader--if you have not read Oddlydrawn's review I believe you will find it very helpful and then, perhaps, like me, you will begin to feel the world isn't as bad as it was half an hour ago.  :-)

Standout tracks include ""Ezio's Family"", ""Earth"", and ""Venice Rooftops"", all of which lovingly combine modern-sounding synthetic rhythms with ageless symphonic, both ethereal and beautiful. (5/5)

2. GRAPHICS. The textures on characters are nearly flawless, the amount of detail in the world around the player is amazing, and the contrast of light and shadow is nicely done. The day-to-night and vice versa transitions are also wonderfully done. The performance capture on the characters is fantastic, and the facial animations rarely venture into the ""uncanny valley"". Still, it's very obvious that the game uses ""ragdoll"" physics rather than some of the higher-end and more realistic physics engines. I still have trouble believing that the game uses the Havok engine. (3/5)

3. LENGTH AND SIZE. With Venice being the largest of them all, the different locations are immersive, wonderfully rendered, highly realistic, and a lot of fun to play around in. Though the game itself is somewhat short, with Sequences 12 and 13 only being available as downloadable content (there are no Trophies for these, so it's still possible to get every trophy without downloading them), and the framing story being a bit uninteresting, the amount of side-missions and treasure-hunting to do around in each of the worlds is enough to keep oneself busy for days or weeks at a time. From the marshes to the mountains to the cathedral in Rome, the sheer size and historical value of the game is sure to entertain and amaze. (3/5)

4. NARRATIVE. Personally, I didn't enjoy the framing narrative of the Pieces of Eden (as I feel the 2012 conspiracy has been much overdone), but the narrative within Ezio's story itself is intriguing. From Leonardo da Vinci to Machiavelli himself, there are so many characters - both real and original - to flesh out the game and make it feel like it really took place. Overall, the internal story is very well-done and engaging, and despite the framing narrative, the ending sequence was quite interesting - and a little bit creepy, not to mention that I found it vaguely offensive in spite of the disclaimer shown at the beginning of each gaming session. (4/5)

5. CONTROLS. The controls take some getting used to, and even after getting used to them, are still rather broken. The context commands are difficult, and the parkour movements are so clumsy it makes one want to crush the controller in sheer frustration. Hopping from point to point is a nightmare, as sometimes Ezio will plunge off a roof for no apparent reason. Climbing is at first a nightmare as well, as often Ezio tends to jump off entirely, sometimes to his death. Context commands outside of combat are okay, but in combat, the motion-captured movements are so clumsy and slow that it makes you glad the enemies are incapable of moving any faster than you. The lack of Sixaxis support for Leonardo's flying machine is blatantly obvious and would have likely made the sequence (sequences, if you download Sequence 12) easier for the PS3 version. The camera is also rather awful, and all these combine to make for a somewhat nauseating experience. (1/5)

6. CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE. Being interrupted, at least early in the game, every two to three minutes by a cutscene that cannot be skipped just serves to make the game less enjoyable. There's no doubt that the motion capture done on the characters is very well done, but instead of integrating the story into the game, the game is integrated into the story. In other words, this plays like a very well-done but rather clumsy big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. At times, it feels as though it would have been better off as a film. (2/5)

OVERALL: the controls are broken regardless of one's skill with them. However, the rest of the game is well done and, for the most part, nicely enjoyable. Total Score: (18/30)",A steep learning curve with rewarding gameplay,1287964800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"11 8, 2008",A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B0000296O5,Feelah the tigress,"FF8 has the unfortunate curse of being the next in line after FF7.  That means it had a lot of hype to live up to.  I suspect that's why some people will hate this game-- it just isn't FF7.  However, even though this game isn't FF7, it's an extremely good RPG that stands on its own merits.  It's one of my favorite games of all time (just as good as FF7, although my absolute favorite game is FF9).  Well, let's jump right into the review!

Graphics (score 10/10): The graphics were superb when this game came out, and are still excellent, in my opinion.  I still find them pleasing to the eye.  Of course, I'm not nearly as picky as some people, and obviously, I recognize that it's graphics are older now, but they were magnificent for their time.

Music (score 10/10): Wow.  When I first heard the opening song (Liberi Fatali), I was blown away.  The rest of the game's music doesn't dissapoint either.  Be it exciting songs or mellow tunes, FF8 delivers.  I actually went and bought the soundtrack, which I still listen to, to this day.

Characters (score 10/10): Who doesn't love Squall? He's quite likeable in a grumpy anti-social sort of way....  Plus he's an excellent case study in avoidant-attachment disorder.  Ha ha... Seriously, though, the characters are very well-developed.  I love having unique introspection into the psyche of a main character.  The rest of the characters are excellent, too.  Everyone has a distinctive personality and a role to play in the story; no one feels like they were tacked on at the last minute just to increase the party size (a problem with some other RPGs I've played; I'm looking at you, FF12!).  The characters are portrayed very well and you will become attached to them very quickly.

Story (score 10/10): The story, too, is excellent.  I was thoroughly engaged by it; it has just the right balance of character development and intriguing plot points to keep you entertained. I've played this game at least six times now over the years and I'm still not sick of it.

Battle System (score 9/10): Combat is turn-based like most Final Fantasies.  You draw magic out of enemies to cast directly on enemies, or to equip as stat buffers.  It's fairly easy to learn this system. However, drawing magic over and over again and re-equiping it constantly (and also re-equiping GFs) can get rather tedious; that's what knocks the point off the score.  Other than that, the battle system is fine.  I especially like the ability to pull the trigger on the gunblade using the R1 button; it adds a level of fun interactiveness to the battles.

Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Let's see, the first thing of note that comes to mind is the fact that enemies level up at the same rate as Squall.  That means that power-leveling is no longer desirable.  This might be disappointing to some, but I found it to be quite nice because the game isn't overly hard, and I didn't have to waste time power-leveling.  Another point of interest is that you eventually get a way to avoid random battles, which is awesome.  Another point is that there are plenty of mini-games and side-quests of sufficient variety available to enjoy (my favorite is the card game).  So, there should be plenty features here to please everyone.

Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score.  I might have given this game a ""8"" instead of a ""10"" if I had reviewed it when I first bought it, but now that I've played so many different RPGs over the years I realize what a treasure I really have in FF8.  This game really is awesome and I recommend it to all fans of RPGs.",This is one of my favorite RPGs...,1226102400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Essentially what you are buying is an updated version of the original game with better graphics - nothing more. The online multiplayer utilizes the ""Halo: Reach"" engine, but includes maps from ""Halo: CE"".

Their excuses for this:

1) ""We didn't want to split up the reach community!""
Bizarre logic. Should we expect that for H4? Sorry guys, no H4 multiplayer - wouldn't want to split up the Reach community! Just imagine if COD used that logic. You buy Modern Warfare 3, only to find out that online multiplayer is Black Ops. What brilliance! Point being, everyone wanted online multiplayer for CE. Even the people that criticize us for being pissed off admit they would of liked to have seen multiplayer for CE.

2) ""We would have had to ship on 2 discs!""
Would you buy a 2 disc game for the ability to play online multiplayer? There's your answer to this excuse.

Answers to people criticizing my review:

1) ""You should have read the box!""
A) It's not a box, it's a case.
B) This is Amazon.com - not Wal-Mart. There is no ""box"" to look at. Nowhere in this page's product description does it say it utilizes the Halo: Reach engine.
C) I didn't buy the game, knowing months before that it didn't include online multiplayer. I created a petition on Change as well as the Waypoint forums to bring multiplayer back. I don't know why you genius's assume because I'm complaining about there not being multiplayer, that apparently means I thought there was. I want multiplayer on the game whether or not I thought it was going to have it or not - duh!
D) Go heckle people walking out of Target and Wal-Mart. Go chill inside of Gamestop and right after someone buys the game you can start yelling ""SHOULDA READ THE BOX, DERRR"". Who does that anyways? Is it common for games that have the xbox live strip, to be a different xbox live game? Besides ODST, this is the only game I know of that utilizes a completely different game's online portion.

Sadly, the Rainbow Six series deviated from it's roots and evolved (or should I say ""devolved"" if there's such a term) into a generic shooter with minimal squad commands.

Good points:

Nice graphics and enviromnental effects.

A lot of enemies to shoot at that shoot back.

More action packed levels instead of stealth based (infact, your guns don't sport silencers anymore).

Cinematic movies.

Bad points:

Goggle view is lame and unrealistic.

Your characters don't wear masks and helmets (Real counter-terror operatives use masks)

No more pre-mission planning (same comment with Rainbow Six 3)

No recognizable differences among firearms (just the difference in sighting mechanism).

Bottomline:

For people looking for realistic counter-terror ops, this is not the game for you.  But for people looking for fun action shooters, this game is good enough.

I ordered this from japan and it arrived shortly and works great on the American vita models, it has all of the space I need and more.

In reference to the other person who feels that the card costs as much as the system, someone probably ordered a few and is raising the price by a large margin.  These cards will only cost about $100 when they are released in the USA, the one card available through amazon prime is setting prices that are unreasonable, $175 is far too much however I was able to get one for $125 through Hananoiro Shop.

If you need the space then I would say to get this card, if anyone has any questions please feel free to ask.

P.S.  I've noticed that a lot of people have been giving this product negative reviews, I wanted to just tell people that these guys aren't upset because the product is faulty or defective but they gave it poor reviews because they are unhappy with the price.

No one has seen anything like it and visually, was an improvement to id Software's widely successful Wolfenstein 3D. DOOM also generated controversy along with Mortal Kombat for having over the top violence and high levels of blood and gore. So naturally it was a hit with gamers. Fast forward 9-10 months later, DOOM II came out, still retaining the high amounts of violence and gore became just as big if not bigger. So when Sony came out with Playstation in 1995, of course they wanted a home version of this widely popular first person shooter. And it doesn't disappoint. DOOM for the Playstation has both DOOM (more specially, the Ultimate DOOM which id Software released in 1995. Basically DOOM with an added fourth episode) and DOOM II in one disc making one giant game. The gameplay is simple but extremely addicting which makes DOOM a blast to play. A large arsenal of weapons ranging from a pistol, to a shotgun, a plasma gun, heck even a chainsaw to name a few. It's a little primitive, you can't look up, down, or even jump but with the way the levels are designed, you don't need to. Enemies come from undead possessed soldiers and demons big and small with epic boss battles not to mention cool power ups. If you have still have a PS1 lying and want some good first shooters I recommend this and the just as good Final DOOM.

Single players can play arcade style races or enter simulation mode to compete on multiple-race circuits; there are different car classes, unlimited qualifying, and money to buy cars, parts, and other trinkets.  Learning the tracks and your car is essential to successful driving; the manual comes with a few pages from the Skip Barber manual that will give you the basics.
You'll grit your teeth in frustration trying to beat a souped-up Daihatsu wagon in your stock Miata at the lower-echelon levels; and your brain will explode trying to pilot a Dodge Viper-based racecar around a track at speeds exceeding 150 miles per hour.  Every aspect of the experience is realistic and adjustable, from tire camber to gear ratios; sound is awesome; and there are hundreds of cars to choose from.  Music selection is a little sparse.
Multiple players can compete on 1 screen, or the iLink cables and hub can be used to link up to 4 racers (requiring a PS2 and a TV for each of them.)

In every room that you reach, this game hammers home the message that you have to stick together and work as a group. When jumping from one rooftop to another, you may misjudge the distance and fall short. Thankfully, a teammate can pull you up.

Even before the game commences, you'll find yourself coordinating tactics with your soon-to-be companions at the character selection screen. In a similar vein to an RPG, each of the eight playable characters that you can select brings completely different abilities to the table that you must factor in. Do you bring a lock-picker? Someone with extra inventory spots? Or rely on firepower with a weapons expert?

Unlike the other games in the series, zombies can pass from room to room and are often found in packs. Taking this newfound hunting prowess into account, Capcom has implemented a handful of new techniques that players can use to survive. You can slide under beds, hide in lockers, and even repel a zombie attack by forcing their head away from your neck with enough breathing room to raise your pistol and shoot them directly between the eyes. You'll even find strategy in the reloading of weapons. For instance, a box of shells takes more time to load than a clip. As annoying as it is to watch your character get munched because he couldn't load the rounds quick enough, I really like this aspect. It makes you keep an eye on every little detail.

Where Outbreak excels in engrossing multiplayer and creative gameplay, the overall design of the game is very odd. Rather than creating one lengthy quest that players can really sink their teeth into, Capcom opted to break up the game into five separate scenarios that are roughly 45 minutes each. If you die, you'll turn into a zombie for a brief extent (and yes, you can attack your teammates if you like), then will be dropped out of the game. Sadly, you can't re-spawn. You either have to wait for your friends to finish up, or find another game to enter.

One would think that Square Enix would include this feature since this game is over 10 years old and the large majority of people buying this game have already played it. Not only that, but there are scenes that can't advance more quickly by mashing X that you otherwise could have in the original version. The first clear example being during a scene at the entrance to Kilika Temple (within the first few hours of the game) with the Luca Goers.

Why is this a big deal for me? It's a JRPG. The story in X is pretty good, but it's not stellar. I mostly play games for their battle system, not the story. It would be nice to be able to skip at least some of the cutscenes, even just the ones that are FMVs. Plus, I would have liked to attempt to speed run the game, but with cutscenes, the best times on the PS2 barely cut 11 hours. An extra hour is added on this version for seemingly longer load times and previously partially-skippable scenes. Such a shame.

Well, now that I'm off my soapbox, I'll say some positive things. The updated graphics look really great, and it's good that they added in the international version, which was previously unavailable in the US. I'm excited to try the new sphere grid.

We are solid gamers, each of us able to polish off most games on the ""normal"" setting pretty easily.  We are not spectacular players, we are not honed machines of video game grace.  But we play for hours every week and have done so for years, so we are not newbies by any stretch of the imagination; please take my complaints about this game with that in mind--if you are a polished videogame diety, then you will have less trouble than we did.  If you are a newbie, well then, pay extra attention--this game's fun quotient (which is very high at times) is seriously hampered by its bizarre controls and frustrating requirements.

This is a visually arresting game--the style is clean and modern, beautiful to look at.  It is as if the entire city agreed to a limited but brilliant palette, and keeps everything really clean.  The buildings are interesting to look at, and the places that you play through are full of fun things to jump on and over.  My wife and I are fascinated by parkour in real life, so finding a beautiful looking game that focuses on parkour made us really happy at first.  We also like the style of animation--very Adult Swim cool.  We were a little confused as to why the game animation style varies so greatly from the story animation, but overall that is not a big deal.  Both are fun to watch, and the animation is great both directions.  The story line is interesting and keeps you moving, even when you are contemplating pulling the disc out of your PS3 and lighitng it on fire.  Or kicking the game designers in their collective shins.

So yea, first person parkour was way cool.  At first.  Then the frustration began.

Not quite as fun as moving through the streets for the first time was in Assassin's creed, but close to that fun.  You jump from obstacle to obstacle, under pipes, over huge gaps in buildings...breathtaking.  The downside is you can't see all the cool moves you are getting to do, and that is kind of a shame.  You have this superbad character you are playing, but you never really get to see her in action.  I'd like to see a replay option in 3rd person as a bonus.

Unfortunately, there are many times when you are under pressure--either someone is shooting you, or for some other reason you have a time issue.  This would not be bad if the game were better at directing you...but it sucks at this.  ""Ah!"" you exclaim, ""but that is the beauty of the game! You must find your own way!"" you say.  Well, that is a legitimate point, within reason.  There have been more than one occasion in which the way forward can only be reached in a single fashion, and the secret is pretty well hidden.  That is fine if you aren't getting shot at...but if you keep dying because a sniper is shooting you and you don't know where to go...and if it happens 10-15 times...and if you keep getting set back in front of a difficult obstacle you have to conquer first, and that also kills you 10-15 times...then somewhere the game designers didn't really think about what they were doing.  Yes, we got past all of them eventually, but the repetition it took us (and we are good gamers, mind you) got really boring and frustrating.  After a while it wasn't fun any more, and when a game becomes not fun, then it makes you wonder why you are playing it.

And while I am on the subject of snipers (and other gun toting baddies in general), whoever designed the combat portion of this game deserves to be taken out back and forced to fight like our heroine.  Guns are few, far between, non-flashy or exciting to use, have no aiming aid (a real bummer), and are essentially temporary--you can't store them on your person.  And guns are the good part--your personal ability to fight is there...she does have some moves (nice spin kick!), but executing them in any reasonable fashion against their bad guys is not easy to do, and you die a lot.  A lot.  A lot.  Once more, frustrating, why am I playing this game?

Also, I have a huge issue with the controls.  Some people have complemented DICE on the controls.  I say that whoever designed the controls for the PS3 needs to have their head examined.  L1 is jump? The single most frequently used button in the game is L1? Really? Oh, and the second most used control is L2? OK, if you are willing to buy into L1 is jump, then L2 as duck makes sense.  But I respectfully suggest that allowing some control re-assignment would be better for those of us who are used to X being jump--because 5000 other games have taught us that x=jump!  And whoever made the virtually useless R1 ""insta-reverse"" should be shot with a water gun full of curdled goat milk.  ""Insta reverse"" is very useful in some jumping situations, but R1 has often been ""Fire!"" or other things in other games, and let me tell you that hitting R1 in a fight can spell your rapid death.  Sounds simple.  But whatever.  In this day and age, there is no excuse for controls that a player doesn't like not being completely reassignable--or at least having alternative control schemes.  Something.  My wife and I both think that this was our number one complaint.

Wow, so after reading that, you must think that there is no reason to play this game at all.  And you would be wrong, because when the frustrating portions of the game are not bothering you, this game is one of fluid grace, of breathtaking running, jumping climbing excitement.  She moves like a dream, when she is allowed to do so, and for those moments when things are going well, it is just magic.  Pure magic.  I loved those portions.

In the end, I would not buy this game again, knowing what I know.  It was tons of fun for a few moments, and then some fun for a lot more moments, but not much fun at all for about half of it.  I would consider buying a sequel if the game designer takes some of these complaints into consideration--and I know that I am not the only one who feels this way--other reviewers on professional sites have had the same complaints about replaying levels over and over again until they get them right.

So how do you know if it is your cup of tea? Rent it!  Check out a demo!  If you dig it, don't hesitate to throw down  the 60 bones for a really unique experience.  But if you have a hard time, then renting is really a better choice.

Okay, now that I just beat this game, I think it's time I give my two cents and lay this shock to rest. Anyway, I think it's time we recall the Paper Mario games before we go straight to this. They are extremely fleshed-out RPGs starring Nintendo's plucky plumber, and they do a great job at breathing new life into the franchise. The stories have been engaging and hilarious, and the atmospheres and battling mechanics are timeless. With that said, Super Paper Mario takes the series to a new direction: Outside the RPG format.

Yep, this is now an action-adventure-platformer-puzzler extravaganza, and with what's arguably the heaviest plot in the series; one day, Mario and Luigi were sitting around at home, when suddenly, Peach gets kidnapped! What I love about this game is that regardless of the story's tone, the writing knows when to time its jokes. In this case, they parody the Peach-kidnapping scenario as if it was the first time (""Why, that's ridiculous! Who in the world would do such a thing?!"" - ""Bro, this must be the work of that guy! That bad guy!""). But after going into Bowser's Castle, it turns out that a mysterious being named Count Bleck was the kidnapper, and he proceeds to not only kidnap Luigi and Bowser, but also sends Mario to a place called Flipside, and has this giant void set up to wipe out all living worlds. Yeah. Things get pretty real at times.

There are some things I have to gripe about, though. Let's start with who Mario encounters during his adventure. The first character that greets Mario is Tippi, a ""Pixl"" who seems to be this game's Goombella/Goombario. She actually serves of greater significance in another portion of the story, but the rest of the Pixls are kinda lame; sure, they are useful as powers, but their personalities are lacking, especially considering each one has only one whacked-out conversation with you the entire game, and say nothing more afterwards. The conversations themselves can be fun(ny), but the personalities mesh together. Speaking of which, I'm not a fan of the art direction, which, while fine in its own right, is mostly rather bland in comparison to the atmospheric environments in the previous Paper Mario games. The NPCs within those places also tend to be forgettable (likely due to how they're designed with basic shapes), but there are very notable some exceptions.

Truth be told, though, that's all I really have against the game. Sure, a couple puzzles may be a little too infuriating for my taste, and there may be more reading than necessary for something that isn't an RPG, but considering the series this game hails from, these cons are minor, if they even are cons. The rest of the game really shines in quality; switching from a 2D perspective to 3D is a genius concept, and this holds true in the execution. Not to mention, turn-based battles have been replaced with good ol' stomping on enemies! When the platforming design is good, it's REALLY good. However, this game doesn't just rely on such.

Many of the game's ""levels"" will put your exploration and puzzle-solving skills to the test. Whether you use Pixls or other characters like Bowser, Peach, or Luigi, they will all carry vital abilities for you to use to figure out how to move on or discover a hidden goody. And like the previous installments, Super Paper Mario does provide clues around the actual puzzles; you mainly just have to figure out where you can find the clue or what the clue is trying to tell you. Let me just say this right now: Folks, if you think you're going to play through THIS Wii game casually, your experience will NOT last for long. This game requires a brain, and you must make sure you have your smarts ready. As well as your sense of humor.

I really can't review a Paper Mario game without commenting on how funny a lot of the jokes are! These come in all sizes, from puns (One world is called ""The Underwhere"") to a freakin' game show about asking random questions to decide who is real and who's an imposter! Heck, one of the villains in the game is a completely relatable exaggeration of an Internet nerd! I mean, seriously...I can't do this game justice when it comes to describing all the little comedic lines and touches spread throughout.

What I can do, though, is finally lay out my overall opinion. Super Paper Mario is admittedly not as fantastic as The Thousand-Year Door was. It didn't have the moments or types of locales that that game had, and a couple things didn't translate as well to the action-platformer-adventure-puzzler Super Paper Mario was trying to be. But despite that, I still believe this game is a meaty, underrated Wii game that seems to be looked at from the wrong expectations.

5.0,False,"10 14, 2016",A1Q1R5TCPYIKL4,B01F9HMOBQ,Keith Dworak,"I started playing this 2 days ago and have around 8 hours in on the PC. I joined Origin's access program in order to play the trial to decide if I wanted to shell out the money for this as it has been a LONG time since I paid full price for a video game.

I will preface this by saying I'm running a custom built computer, 16gb ram, i7-4790, r9 290x video card. I have had no performance issues at all and the game has defaulted everything to Ultra, so it looks great.

As soon as the game loads you are launched into an introduction. This intro is two fold, one it gives you an overview of the controls and two it gives you a glimpse of how the war went. This took me around 22 minutes to complete, from the time the game started launching until I could jump into multiplayer. I will also note I have yet to do any of the campaign as the EA Access only gives you 10 hours of play time, I wanted to capitalize on that time in multiplayer.

The Good:

I'm very happy as a PC gamer that I don't have to launch a website to browse for servers and can do everything in game. I don't know why the previous battlefield titles made you first go to the website and then launch the game, seemed just convoluted to me.

Graphics are great. Its a new game and I'm very happy with how it looks. The amount of detail in everything, the grass, the guns, the vehicles, the people, you name it. Looks great and I often find myself looking through my scope at the detail of buildings or vehicles.

The gameplay reminds me of when battlefield was great. I wasn't a huge fan of Hardline which I did spend hours on. I missed what battlefield was back in the day of getting a squad together, commanding some vehicles and total destruction of buildings, landscape, etc. Nothing beat knowing a sniper was up in a tower and blowing that tower up. Remember the big boat crashing into the shore on that one map? I missed that. I love the addition of those huge super vehicles for the losing team. My team was down a couple hundred points in conquest and this giant air ship spawned. I spawned into it, grabbed a gun and went to work. While we still ended up losing, it was a much closer game and I had a blast up in that air ship. The classes are perfect and I favor the sniper, does great at long range and can certainly hold his/her own when rushed.

Controls are easy and the PC controls follow that of the other battlefield titles. I was a bit confused in hardline at how to switch seats in a vehicle and realized it was the function keys, this time around the seats are labeled with the F1, F2, F3 etc keys so if you want to switch to the front gunner all you have to do is press the key associated with that seat, its simple and I like it.

The bad:

As of 10/14/16 @ 11am there have been some bugs with the PC version, maybe they will get fixed as again this is a pre-release I'm playing, maybe they won't in time for the rest of the masses to join in, I don't know. When trying to join a game via quick join I was stuck on ""matching your skill"" it sat there long enough for me to brew a pot of coffee and pour myself a cup. When you hit cancel you are just left looking at an overview of earth and you have to force close the game in order to try again. This is all over their forums and I was able to just open up the server browser and immediately join a game that way, but nonetheless still a bug.

Otherwise I really don't have any complaints. Dice made a great game and I will happily purchase the full product, at full price and play away.

  Boy, was I wrong.
This game is cool. It has 100 times better graphics than anything in the NFS series so far. (Its not unreal tournament 3, but what is?) It had a better structure so that it felt more like a game than a racing simulator. Also the first one was sorta ""kiddy."" Now Im not the type that enjoys Grand Theft Auto 3 type games, but this felt a lot more like an exciting road rage than a boring race. Sure theres no violence... but the cops seem worried and sometimes when you drive through a city street you here screams of terror from inside the houses :). I could go on and on revieing this game, there is so much to talk about. But to spair all of you I will simply sum it up...
Pros: Nice graphics
  Better Gameplay
  Better Music
  The Cars Show Dammage :)
  The Police chases are FAR more intence with  hellecopters and road blocks.
  You get points to buy cars instaid of unlocking them
  You have a funky looking meter that shows you if you are getting away from the cops
Cons: Not a lot but there are a few things (like night racing) that are not included. This isn't a big problem for me however its one of those things where you say ""Come on guys! You made a good game, would it be that much harder to include something small like this?"" Oh well. No big deal.
One more Con for me is that there seams to be some black patches that flash across the screen sometimes... and sometimes the game freezes for about 5 seconds. This is probably just my computer though. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD ONE!

1.0,True,"11 19, 2011",A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,B002BSA1C6,Caraculiambro,"I am forced to admit that GT5 gives you a lot for your money, but there were so many head-slappingly inane decisions made about the gameplay that I am forced to give this a hostile review:

1.  The main thing I hated about this game was that there were no difficulty settings.  Basically you must take everything at full-bore difficulty, and woe to you if this is too hard.  But really, it's not that some of the tracks are hard so much as the WAY they were hard.  You're driving a car worth about 45,000 and they put you in races with supercars worth 20 million?  (Not just that, but there's no way you youself can possibly purchase such cars at this point.)  This is neither fun nor fair, but there's nothing you can do about it.  So you just start calculating to yourself, ""If I were to come in first place in this race 215 times, I would have enough money to buy one of those Ferraris.""

2.  Another gripe I have is that in this game, supercars are not supercars.  Naturally after you've been playing for a little while you will shop around for a Ferrari or a Lamborghini.  Don't spend your money:  instead, go to the Internet, where you'll find discussion forums that will tell you that you can get a much better-performing car for a lot less, say the Nissan GT-R.  But this is a little ridiculous.  The game doesn't seem right when a 2009 fully-decked out Lamborghini is getting comprehensively out-performed by a garden-variety Nissan sedan!  Something seems wrong.

3.  There are no Porsches to be had in this game, for licensing reasons, I assume.  This is probably not the programmers' fault, but still.

4.  One can maximally have only 20 million in the bank.  This really blows since the cars that cost 20 million will cost you more than that, since it's virutally impossible to ding 20 million precisely:  any money earned over that will simply not be recorded.  But what really blows is that when you finally buy that Lamborghini Miura, you'll have to garage it until you can buy tires for it.  This really seemed wrong.

5.  There exists a big gap between the Professional Series and the Extreme series.  Basically, if you'd like to continue into the Extreme Series, you're going to need a car that is worth several million dollars.  The problem is that nothing you can possibly do in the Professional Series is going to net you anywhere near that amount of money.  There is simply no way to transition smoothly from the Profeesional Series to the Extreme Series.  Hence the only solution is you've got to sit there for a couple of weeks running your B-spec drivers robotically around Daytona-style tracks until you have enough money to continue on with the next phase of the game.  So basically the game gets held up for a week or two while you get on to other things, such as your homework.  This was an asinine design decision.

6.  The player is not able to control realism settings.  You've got no choice but to put up with weather, tire burn-out, car damage, etc.

7.  The cars you win for finishing certain series can only be won once.  This doesn't make sense.  Can you imagine telling contestants in any sort of game that they can't win the prize because they've already won such a prize in the past?

8.  The game plays with you by racing cars against you that are not readily available for purchase, such as the Yellowbird or the Chaparral.  I did not find this amusing.

9.  There are not enough tracks!  This is because so many of the tracks are wasted on idiotic races (e.g., a tournament for the owners of a VW Lupo!?!?) that when you'd like to take one of your cars out for a race, there are only three or four choices to choose from?  You can only select the track of your choice if you're just practicing or if you're running cars that you don't own (i.e., GT mode).  But as for taking your beloved babies out on tracks you never get to see them on, forget it!  Those tracks are reserved for the pickup truck races!

10.  One is not allowed to restart races in tournaments.

11.  Having the cost of re-structuring the chassis be half of the car's value was totally unfair, as was the cost of an engine overhaul.  These prices are punitive, not realistic.  And what's the point of this anyways?  Next up:  having us pay for gas and insurance?  (Incidentally, I discovered that one's chassis breaks automatically without your even crashing the car.  Here's how:  1)  buy new car.  2)  enter race  3) immediately exit race before driving an inch.  You'll now have the option of restoring the chassis, implying that the car is damaged, since you're not permitted the option of paying for chassis repairs if the car is not damaged.)

12.  Your car has to come in for pitstops for new tires and stuff:  other cars don't.  On the Extreme B-spec races, for example, it is only your car that has problems with tires balding out about lap 9:  the other cars never seem to.  Why is that?

13.  The physics of the game don't make sense.  First of all, it's impossible to flip your car, no matter what you do.  There is no animation for it.  Neither do cars crash or show damage (though you have to pay for chassis damage).  But it goes deeper than that.  It seems like the physics of crashing and interacting with walls and other cars don't resemble reality.  For example, if you go off the track and hit a wall at, say, a 20 degree angle, your car will be smashed back to about a 160 degree angle, facing the wrong direction.  NEVER are you simply ""righted"" back to a zero degree angle.  It's almost as if the game is punishing you for crashing into walls, but in a way that doesn't make sense visually.  There's more, too.  There seems to be a sort of magnet effect going on sometimes.  Unlike my first example, this might actually be real physics:  I don't know, but it sure feels wrong.  What I mean is that when you run up on the rear end of the car in front of you, your car seems to ""stick"" and you can't detach yourself unless you completely slam on your brakes.  You can't simply scrape off to one side.  The same goes if your car is running along a wall, scraping along it at high speeds.  It seems like you ought to be able to steer away from it, detaching yourself.  But instead you're magically stuck to the wall somehow, and you can only veer away from it by greatly reducing your speed.

14.  Further, the physics of collisions seem unfair.  Every time you collide with another car, yours is the one that is bumped off the road into the sand, never the enemy's.  It seems like this should happen about 50% of the time, but no.  It's virtually impossible to knock an opponent's car off the track:  if you do, it recovers immediately.  It seems like if there is a collision, it negatively affects only your car.  Why do you always get the short end of the stick?

15.  The prices in this game are totally messed up!  You can buy a car for 2 million, deck it out with all the trimmings, and then, when you go to sell it, get about 200,000 for it, even though you haven't put a single mile on it!  This is not how reality works.  Realism-based, eh?

16.  The game keeps making you go over to Google to find out what kinds of cars you're talking about.  When you're in the used store, for example, how'm I supposed to know that an SLS AMG is a kind of Mercedes? [This was fixed in a patch.]

17.  As of the 2.02 update, the game has started to get more mercenary.  There will be cars displayed available for purchase, but you can't buy them unless you pay the company extra money for additional downloadable content through the PlayStation store.  A good example of this is the VW Golf '07.  Before the 2.02 patch, you could simply buy it from the new car dealership.  After December 2011, however, you had to pay more money (literal money, not game credits) to get that car.  Sheesh.  You figure if you lay out forty or fifty bucks for the game, they'd be done hustling you, but no.

18.  There's a huge gap with the difficulty at higher levels of the game:  they don't scale well.  After you get the Formula Gran Turismo, for example, it feels like you entered the cheat code and the remainder of the game is uninteresting, if not tedious.

19.  The manual sucks!  This game was released more than a year previous to this review, and by now you'd think people'd know how to play the game.  No.  For example, what causes chassis damage?  Is it aggressive driving?  Collisions?  Or simply miles?  Nobody seems to know.  Various websites have various theories, but nobody seems to agree about this basic thing.  But don't look to the manual to clarify that or anything else:  the most the extremely brief manual will tell you is ""if you have an epileptic seizure, you should stop playing.""

20. The tracks are aseptic, almost lifeless.  If I see the Monza circuit one more time, I'm gonna barf!  I can't put my finger on why the Need for Speed tracks seem so various and invigorating while those of GT5 seem so jejune, but it's definitely a problem.

21.  There's no way to upgrade your braking and steering.

22.  This game features ads up the wazoo:  currently for Motul, Agip, Dunlop, and some others.  These names will change with time because these companies have paid to have their logos plastered all over the racetracks and there's no way you can avoid them.

23.  There's no way to prevent the game from auto-saving.  This would have been useful in trying out a car you suspected was a crock. The Ferrari Enzo, for example, wasn't worth half the money you paid for it, but there was no way to test it out and then get your money back.

24.  The ""Seasonal Tracks"" require you to race with crummy cars or cars with a strict horsepower limit.

25.  Why can't I paint my cars any color I want as many times as I want?  I have like a billion dollars!  Instead I have to ""earn"" paint!?  It's ridiculous!

26.  There's some sort of bug (or other fun-ruining mechanism) whereby, in B-spec, your drivers don't get full credit for all the experience they accumulate.  This seems to happen about level 30.  You can put them through a 24-hour endurance race, and they'll only move up one level, not the several levels the raw points they've been given should net them.  Then, those excess points disappear somehow and are never counted.

27.  There is (alas!) a rather serious bug that's started to plague the game starting with the patch that came out in December of 2011.  When you are in the camera view that allows you to see the back of your car, the frame will jolt a bit every time you go around a turn to re-center itself.  This only starts happenening after you reach about 10 laps of the same track, but it means that endurance races will give you a headache.

28.  Er, howzabout warning me, before I spend more than 10 million on certain cars such as the Ferrari F1s that they cannot be used in normal races?  And that you're not allowed to sell them once you've bought them?  (As you can tell by this review, I played this game day and night for quite a while, but this was the thing that finally soured me on it and inspired me to write this cranky review.  Go, little review! Fly! May you decrease Polyphony's sales and cause them to go under!)

In sum, it's a little difficult for me to believe I have so many complaints about this game, but I do.  What's not showing, of course, is that I really got into it and played it for weeks.  Hence despite all these gripes I confess that it is well worth the money.  Here's a couple of things I liked about it:

1.  The game really gets you interested in racing history and you start reading a lot more about that subject.  That's gotta be considered a plus for a game.  This kinda starts when you're like, ""Wait.  Why would a '69 Ford be going for 20 million?""

2.  Initially I thought B-spec was the stupidest thing I ever saw.  Why would I want to watch the PlayStation play itself?  That was only until I realized you can set B-spec going while you went off to classes or to sleep and when you came back you'd have a whole bunch of money.  I admit I actually quite got into this:  it was oddly satisfying, heading off to work or wherever, knowing that you were kinda playing even though you weren't there.

Not content with a mere visual upgrade, NBA 2K14 on Sonys next generation system plays a totally different ball game to its existing sibling  and while some of these enhancements undeniably have niggles, they're still terrific additions to an already excellent game.

This is a title thats drenched in more authenticity than a players vest at the end of a high-octane quarter. Recognisable commentators Kevin Harlan, Steve Kerr, and Clark Kellogg narrate with considerable clarity, while Doris Burke interviews various athletes at half-time. Meanwhile, sponsor video transitions pop up alongside NBA logos and help to sell the television broadcast feel as if it were real.
And this is, of course, where the visual prowess of the PS4 comes in, with each court feeling alive due to the varied crowds and immaculate models. There are moments where the immersion is so great that youll forget that its a game  even if the uncanny valley will creep in eventually when a player fails to convey the right emotion, or a couple of identical twins pop up in the audience and make the same cheering motion. The issues are more noticeable due to the outstanding achievements elsewhere  but the game sure does hint at plenty of promise for the future.

In fact, given that sports games have historically struggled with the generation jump, its amazing how realistic this title looks and feels. Animations are much more fluid and realistic, and theres a sense of physicality to the play that wasn't quite there before. In addition, the artificial intelligence is competent and, at times, lifelike  and thats without even mentioning the wealth of new modes and features.
For starters, My Career now plays out like a more structured narrative  a soap opera even. Cutscenes, dialogue trees, and personal objectives form part of your career and the story of your player. Upon picking a likeness, youll start shooting some hoops in the Rookie Showcase, discovering a rival that will follow you through your career and sculpting a personality that affects your team interactions and fan support.

Throughout your career, you can chat with your manager, coaches, and fellow players, having general conversations as well as more meaningful, life shaping ones. Youll begin by watching matches unfold from the bench, ready to jump in should an injury impede the game or the coach decide to take a chance on you. Then its all up to you to prove that you're worth a place in the starting line-up. Its a neat addition that provides a sense of progress to the campaign  even if the voice acting is weak and the coach interactions are restricted to text.
There are other issues, too. Youll encounter some of the same conversations with your coach multiple times, while youll often be given strange mid-match objectives that don't necessarily gel with your teams playing style. For as cute as the idea is, its not an especially engaging narrative either  but its at least a refreshing change from the bland campaigns that are otherwise so common in the sports genre.

Other modes include My GM, which allows you to manage an NBA franchise in a socially interactive style. Youll be able to converse with the teams owner, players, coaches, media outlets, and other executives to solve problems, help grow your franchise, and try to find the right balance between keeping everyone happy and managing your players on the court. As with the campaign, though, the dialogue is atrocious throughout.
Online, you can now play The Park street matches with buddies, as well as the standard head-to-head option. Meanwhile, the collectible card game My Team makes a return, which challenges you to create a fantasy squad in a similar style to FIFAs popular Ultimate Team. One new addition includes Domination, which allows you to pit your assembled squad against all-star teams and real-world rosters.

Conclusion

NBA 2K14 on the PS4 is a stunning digital facsimile of basketball. The titles visually jaw dropping, technically stunning, and represents a whole different ball game to its PS3 counterpart. The new My Career and My GM campaigns don't always score a slam dunk, but they're engaging enough to dribble your way through, making this is a top option if you're eager to shoot some hoops on Sonys next generation console.",Definitely Worth It,1387497600,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Ideally, each of you could play one of the 3 characters as you advance through the story.  Ideally, this game -- which is really quite eye-catching and fun to play -- would last you a few weeks.  Unfortunately, the latter 2 are not true and you're definitely better off splitting this game with some buddies rather than plunking down all of the cash for this yourself.  I beat the game sitting down with it one night.  It is an incredibly short game.
That's not to say it isn't fun.  I ended up playing it over and over again to buff up my characters (you really have to run through the game a few times to get each of the Bouncers pumped up to enjoy it).  Still, I couldn't help but feel cheated that a game that is as expensive as this one is should have lasted longer.  When I played Ps1 games like Jedi Power Battles, the Resident Evil series, etc., they would take me 1-3 weeks at least to finish.  Sadly, most of the ""first wave"" of Ps2 games are ""wham bam thank you sony"".
Like any of the first year games, this one is good for the combined fighting tactics you and the computer use to beat the bad guys.  It pains me that you could not get that 2nd joystick to work and have a buddy at least partner up with you.  If Jedi Power Battles can do that, why couldn't this game?  My expectations were set for a ""team up"" game -- and this game allows up to 4 people to play but only in the ""match"" mode.
As with any of the new Ps2 games, the story here less coherent than a Goddard film, but it is fun nonetheless.  Some of the combat and movie sequences are really cool (I'll nominate Dominque's ""coming out of the closet"" scene as my favorite).
Although I just got done rating ""X Squad"" with a 3, and I'd give ""Warlords"" a 4 stars, this one sadly deserves only 2.  I would buy it used or buy it with a friend so that after the adreniline high of the game is gone, and only 4-8 hours have passed, you're feel that it was worth it.
Oh, this one truly has some of the most absurd ""movie"" moments you're likely to see in a videogame.

This game lets the player create ""styles."" Most pieces of furniture,cars,windows, ect can be customized by material and color. The player can save  the style and simply grag the color combonation onto other objects creating a perfectly matched room. No more mix matched furniture in your sims home!

The game also has an innovative sim building feature. You can now choose wieght, muscle mass, muscle definition. womens bust size.... As well as hair color,including roots, highlights,lowlights, and tips can all be changed accordingly. You can also choose lip,cheek,nose,ect shapes and make small minute changes including the slope of your sims nose. Very handy in recreating real life individuals.

This game also has many expansion packs that have been relieced and are contiueing to be recieced.

One little part of the game I enjoy is the fasmily tree. You can trace your sims family back to its roots. This is not important to game play, though I do really find this a fun little addition.

The sim store, an online official sim store allows your sims to add new furniture not avaliable with the base game to your game, though this costs additional real life money.

My problems with the game are few, glitches.

One of my favorite parts of the Sims 2 was custom content. I would download many houses, sims, cars, ect to my game made by players like you at home. If you didn't get carried away like I did at first, your game does not feature any problems.

In the sims 3 forums I have read that many custom contents have viruses attached. So for a while my game had no problems. I downloaded the sites 3rd most recommended house thinkning well if so many have doawnloaded it it is definatly safe. The game emmediatly slowed down, random freezes in gameplay, resolution was decreased, lots for a distance were warped and strange looking. A HUGE series of problems arose. I have to re-install my game to fix it and loose all my data.

My last problem is pretty simple. The content avaliable to buy at the sims 3 store is very limited. I want a simple womans shoulder length hair that swoops inward at the shoulder with some bangs, thats all. There is nothing close to what I want.

5.0,False,"03 26, 2013",A2WWV0K7B2SRUY,B00GGUT7E8,J. Cummings,"NOTE 1:  This is a review in progress.  I got the game during the midnight release and have been playing through the campaign.  More thoughts will be added as I finish the game.

NOTE 2:  I AM NOT an employee of 2K or Irrational Games.  All the writing you see are my opinions alone; see my other video game reviews (both positive and critical) if you need proof.

The first thing that's going to strike you about Bioshock Infinite is the setting of Columbia.  No longer are you stuck underwater and going through tight corridors as in Bioshock 1 and 2.  The openess of being on will be unlike anything you've experienced in an FPS before.  Many games try to give you the feeling their setting is alive (Skyrim immediately comes to mind), but few immerse you with real life issues (racism, etc.) as B.I. does.  You'll literally stop and listen to the various conversations, that is when you're not getting shot or melee attacked!

I don't want to give too much away, as I don't want to spoil the game for you.  Needless to say, some of the language is going to shock and awe you, so there's a reason the big ""M"" is on the front of the cover.  Definitely either have the kiddos away in bed or have a headset on.

The next thing is your trusty sky-hook.  No longer are battles confined.  Now, you can literally leap on the multitude of railings, slide down, see an enemy and drop on them to attack.  The freedom this opens up to approach different situations is a liberation.  Yes, some of the game is ""on rails"" and you won't have this opportunity through the entire game.  But there are always going to be limitations with software, hardware etc. that restricts visions.

Those familiar with Bioshock and Bioshock 2 know you carry a power in your left hand (called ""vigors"" in this game, previous veterans of Bioshock recognize these as ""Plasmids"") and a weapon in the right.  B.I. doesn't mess with this formula but DOES change your customization where it is much, much deeper.

You will also find various Gear lying around, of which you can equip a certain amount (4 to start).  These effects vary as well, from giving your Skyhook melee a shock charge to increased damage against certain enemy types.

When you add in the random things that Elizabeth brings into the fray later in the story (called ""tears""), the combinations are staggering and offers replay just to see how insane a setup you can create.  For example, you could have Murder of Crows equipped, initiate it, switch to Devil's Ball, which will catch your crows on fire, which will catch your enemies on fire, and Elizabeth warps in a machine gun turret which finishes the job.  It's honestly something hard to put into words.  You simply have to experience it for yourself.

Sadly, the weapons are pretty standard-fair for this kind of game (shotguns, machine guns, etc).  You could put a 1910 coat of paint on pretty much any COD gun and you have a B.I. gun.  Seems like a lost opportunity here.  The standard ""spend this to upgrade that"" is present in the game.  You will find locked chests which will make you hunt for keys.  However, what you find in these chests (infusions, which let you upgrade your shield, health or salt, respectfully, ala Skyrim) as well as Gear, etc. are WELL worth your time to seek and find the keys.

But what's a great action game without a story?  The basic gist is you are Booker DeWitt, here in Columbia to rescue Elizabeth.  Who just may be the most full-fleshed out AI character to date.  Through her communication, both verbal and non, you feel an engagement with her that you haven't felt in other games.  You actually CARE what becomes of her.  And that leads you to got he** bent on doing anything and everything to leave with her intact.  Again, I'm trying to keep this a spoiler-free review, but there are so many twists and turns in this story that by the time you hit 10 hours through the game you'll be like ""what the heck just happened???""  In a GOOD way.

Enemy AI is very smart, and just jumping on one of those sky-hooks isn't always enough to escape getting pummelled.  They take cover and, especially at a point in the middle of the game, will make you bring all your skills and items to bear or else you will find yourself dying.  Repeatedly.

Regardless of what you might have felt for Bioshock 1 or 2, or if you have never played a Bioshock game, the setting, gameplay and sheer scope of Bioshock Infinite are well worth the price of admission.  When history looks back on the PS3, this will become one of the defining games of this console generation and simply should not and cannot be missed.","Bioshock Infinite Review:  Heads for the clouds, soars over the moon",1364256000,123,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

I'm a bit bewildered by the positive reviews of this game. I know fans love the game itself, heck, I consider myself a MAJOR fan of the actual game show and man I find myself going to YouTube to check out Richard Dawson in his prime. But it's not all bells and roses in this game on my beloved Wii. First the good stuff. How the questions are answered if flawlessly executed. I thought without a keyboard that answering questions would be a tedious task with the remotes, but it works well and how the suggestions instantly come up as you start typing is great. It's definitely better as a multiplayer experience and I love the classic intro music before the game starts.

But from there, this game is a disappointment. First off, why no ability to download new questions online? It can be easily done with the ability to go online with the Wii and at the Wii store, but no, you're stuck with the questions on the disc. I had repeat questions on my 2nd game, and in many cases, they were consecutive questions that were from the previous game. 1000 questions offered seems like a lot, but really? Is it? You can easily go through 25-35 questions a game. You're bound to find repeats and eventually you're going to hear them all depending how much you play the game. The presention is average at best. While the opening theme is there on the menu screen, it's not on the game itself. There is no game show host at all, and the guy who does that voice is a generic guy. Does the job, but needs more spunk. The people in this game are prerendered for you, heck you can't even use your Mii's in the game so again, you're limited. The avatars are pretty shallow, and while you can change their wardrobes somewhat, again, it's so limited to what could have been. The game also has some bugs. I noticed when you buzz in after playing consecutive games, that the buzz sound doesn't even work anymore. Um, hello quality control? And as I said above, some of the answers for the surveys should simply not be there. I always wonder if they ask these questions to hundreds of people like they say, but sometimes I wonder.

For the price you pay for this game, 1000 questions is not enough. The inability to download new ones even makes it more of a reason to be weary of spending your money on this. It's got some fun moments and yes, it feels and plays like the Feud.

I looked up Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection, for this offered $30 for all 3 games. This was perfect, no searching around everywhere buying separate overpriced games.

MGS1 was early PSX technology, it was one of the newer 3d games at the time. Like all MGS's it's mainly stealth gameplay. The enemy soldiers are the easiest of the MG series. It's a good introduction into the gameplay until later titles. Your main character is Solid Snake who has to rescue 2 hostages, but the mission becomes much more. He has to stop the Metal Gear, a weapon of destruction. The villians in this one as well as other Metal Gear's are strange and introduce you to their back stories along the way. You'll meet up with Meryl in the game, a lady soldier who helps you out at times. This game is actually my 2nd favorite MGS game after 4.

MGS2 has some mixed reviews, let's just say you won't play Snake the whole time. You'll also play as Raiden a new soldier being sent out to rescue the president, and prevent an explosion and environmental disaster on a water base. You do get the impression of him being a rookie, he complains at times, and seems to be learning with each new sitution. He's an ok character to me.

The thing I don't like in this game mainly for me is the base itself, it seems like your going back and forth in circles. Like go to Strut A and to Core 2, to Strut AB. You do this alot. The spy robot are also a pain, I prefered the cameras. Now the story is good, like the other MGS's. This is the least favorite game still out of the series, not good exactly overall but ok.

MGS 3 is the hardest out of all MGS's for me. I've died quite alot. You play Big Boss when he was younger, known now as the original Snake. You'll have a lot of enemies bunched together. It's a harder to stealth enemies. You have the added camoflouge in this game accordingly to the envirionment your in. For example dirt plantless environment, dark, forest, etc. The enemies are hard to see themselves, they take on the color of their environment. This game has the best story in my opinion, but it's hard and can be frustating.

The enemies in this are crazy as always, a guy with bees and a 100 year old sniper or some of them. In all the MGS's you get a radar, in this game you only get sonar. The sonar you have to click the R3 button, so it's tougher in this one. You can change the camera angle in this subsitence version, the older MGS 3 you couldn't. The camera change in this does help somewhat.

There's just no beating this deal. If your interested in even 1 MGS game, just get the whole pack it's $30 anyways. I'm glad I have the whole story line now, and going through them a second time should be easier. Remember some of them you get away less with stealth than others, so be wary. I really enjoyed this series.",Liquid Snake,1223164800,,,

For myself, Final Fantasy X has been what all the others were for me: a very entertaining diversion that kept me glued to the console until I finished playing the game two or three times. The worlds in the FF games are always enormous, and it hasn't been unusual for me to spend 120 hours on a single playthrough as I seek out everything the game has to offer.
This is a very linear game, as other people have observed. Myself, I find that linearity rather compelling, as the stakes keep rising the closer the pilgrims get to their goal.
Filled with the usual twists, turns and shocks that players have come to expect from this series, this one's a corker of an adventure with graphics and sound unlike any game you've ever experienced.
I just finished the game yesterday, and I have to say that it was one of the most satisfying gaming experiences I've ever had.  No, the final bosses weren't all that tough, but they were appropriate to the story:  you understood why you were fighting them and what was at stake.  After the showdown, you're treated to a theatrical-quality animated denoument that will move all but the most cynical.  I was so enthralled by the experience that I immediately went back and played the final bosses again, just to see the end of the story one more time.","The real question is, should you buy this game?",1013558400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The graphics are amazing they make the Two Towers game look like an N64 game.  The animation is very smooth and who can forget the amazing effect.  In the beginning of game you will pick one of three paths to follow.  You can pick Sam and Frodoes (play as Sam or Frodo) adventure of getting the ring to Mount Doom.  You can pick Gandafs adventure (play as Gandaf) as he helps to take down Isingurd and defend Minas Tirith. The last path to take will allow you to play as Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli, as they cause all kinds of hell, from fighting dragons, to ghosts, to thousands of Orcs and Goblins, and other things in black armor.  There are also three secret characters that you can unlock. (one of them is Golom). Return Of The King will offer more then 15 different levels to play.  In a lot of levels you can interact with items and weapons, like shooting a catapult or big battle bows, to climbing latter's and sliding down ropes.  A cool new feature to the game is Co-op mode.  This means you can fight every level with a friend at your side.  If you don't have any friends you can play with a random person online, how cool is that.  The only reason I give this game four stars is one the Camera angle can screw you up in some places.  At times the camera will be perfect at other times you won't be able to see crap.  Another problem is they haven't changed the formula of the game.  In almost every level you go to an area kill 50 Orcs and go to the next area.  Not all the levels are like that but a lot of them are.  Every character has three basic attacks quick attack, fierce attack, and ranged attack, you can also parry.  As you kill enemies you will gain experience, which will allow you to buy new attacks and combos. In the end LOTR Return Of The King is a great game, you should definitely by it.

Despite being a remake of a Japanese only DS game, its aesthetics and playstyle feel like they hopped right off the PS2 circa 2001. It features relatively blocky graphics with limited animations, generic synth music, a Working Design quality translation (minus the memes), three-building sized towns with static NPCs, and a story that wouldn't look out of place side-by-side with Tales of Phantasia.

But these aren't knocks against the game. Tales of Hearts R revels in feeling like a lost classic. For as generic as the story is it's also endearingly charming and blindingly optimistic. Things take time to get moving but eventually the colorful cast of anime cliche characters take center stage to steal your heart. At the end of the day the plot resembles Phantasia to the core -- an ancient race from a doomed planet wants to restore it by destroying yours -- but the localization is so tight that all the story beats strike a chord even if you've seen them all before.

But Tales has largely been about combat and it doesn't disappoint. Starting off with the simple 3-hit combos and generic artes, you eventually gain access to a simple points-based system allowing you to boost a core attribute (hp, sp, physical, and so on) while also unlocking skills and artes that you can assign. Characters can also bond with each other, a system that increases as they fight together or through story skits, which allows them to share skills if they have a strong bond. Each bond is accompanied by a cute little thought bubble which adds more flavor to an otherwise mundane video game mechanic.

ToHR puts more emphasis on blocking than other games in the series. There are several skills that increase damage reduction from blocking and enemies have an ability to break your combos with a powerful attack. Blocking this attack at the right moment executes a counter which stuns an enemy and allows you to rack up higher combos. New to this system are ""chase links"" that when activated allow you to knock around an enemy through the air like a scene from Dragon Ball Z. The high encounter rate makes certain dungeons exceedingly dull but this battle system contains some of my favorite boss encounters out of the entire series.

Tales won't wow RPG veterans you but as an original handheld RPG it's a good title as well as one of the better entries in the series. This would've turned heads 15 years ago on the PS2 yet as old as it feels it's still exceptionally well made if you can get over how generic the opening hours are.

5.0,True,"10 25, 2011",A22F3BWM7RAHDA,B005FAH5EY,P. B. Sharp,"Not only a visual delight but the sounds of a carnival will put this elegant game right in your lap and you'll be hearing ghostly echoes- shrieking  children, crunching leaves, popcorn popping, snake oil barkers pitching their wares. You are plunged into an  atmosphere of an amusement park that looks bright on the surface  but is really decaying and is really evil, a miasma hovering  over everything. It is winter with the trees bare and seeming to writhe and sullen leaves blow in your path.

The extremely cluttered hidden object scenes are very clear and in sharp focus and will send HOG enthusiasts straight to Nirvana. However, some objects are miniscule or tucked into dark areas. Often you have to combine two objects before you can clear them- such as putting black stripes on a white horse with a paintbrush to get the required zebra. One object  to be found in each search environment will go into your inventory for use later and it's not always easy to figure out what does what.

An evil dwarf  who owns the decrepit carnival is out to capture souls and you have to beat him at his own game to win back your little brother, whose  soul is hanging in the balance. The dwarf's creepy, gloating voice issues from loud speakers as you make your way through the carnival. You will confront many mini-games some of which are familiar but they are nicely choreographed and the producers have put their own spin on them - they're fun rather than daunting. A handy map allows you to quickly jump about the carnival without having to slog your way on your own.

I may sound like I'm gushing but I AM gushing! This adventure takes a long time to play through and there are no fluffy fillers. You will be hooked right away by this beautiful game as the atmosphere envelops you. The only two things I would change are the hint mechanism that takes forever to rev up and the title ""Dreamland"" which seems inappropriate for such a macabre place. That may be the point, though, the amusement park being more of a nightmare and therefore a huge contrast to the cheerful place the carnival once was.

P.S. SPOILER
At the end of the game is a very tricky puzzle. You have to position 6 doves in the cemetery. The only way to get them in the right spots is to press the hint button while aiming in the dove direction. Copy the position of the doves and release the hint button, then place them in their correct slot.",Stunning!,1319500800,9,,

The things I like about the game are the online ranking system, it works well.  I find myself at about 50:50 for win/loss, which in my eyes shows matchmaking is doing a good job at keeping it challenging, yet rewarding.

The main story mode is kind of hit or miss.  I can't bring myself to watch the cheesy cutscenes and movies.  Having to unlock some of the characters can be grueling as well.  Some people just run right through Seth (Cammy, Zangief, Rufus, the French fighting guy, and Sagat).  I was never able to get the hang of the charge characters.  I've used a joystick and controller (with Kontrol Freeks), and I do much better with the controller.  There's not really a good way to learn these moves either because if you don't do them fast enough it doesn't count it as a move anyway.

On the PS3, the character control and power access is smooth and intuitive.  The replay with different teams of characters has so far been high.

The only drawbacks to the game are the dark backgrounds which seemed to appear after the X-Men series and the cumbersome inventory systems for the boosts. I did try the game on more than one TV and the backgrounds are dark. Not a huge issue overall and you get use to it.

Other than that MUA2 offers all the button matching fun from the first two X-Men games with updated graphic, sounds, and character utilization. It's also good to get through Marvel's Civil War without Captain America dying.

It's as simple as that: it is a very poor interface and it actively hampers the game (which is why I'm dinging it a full two stars).  I understand what the designers were shooting for, which is a thoroughly immersive and natural interface, but the mouse isn't the right technology for what they were attempting.  Now, if VR gloves ever start to penetrate the consumer market, then such an interface could be justified.
That said, if you can grit your teeth and look past the interface (and, for many players, that's just not going to be possible), the game itself is nothing short of revolutionary.  It's complex, its detailed, it's *entertaining*, it's imaginitive, and, above all else, it is utterly engrossing.  I've never played a god-style game where you actually started to feel like a deity in charge of real people, with the full range of responsibilities and, most innovatively, moral choices that such a being would face.  It's refreshing that the game doesn't compell you to be a good guy, or punish you for being a bad guy.  In spite of that, I've found that it's actually rather hard to deliberately be a malevolent deity for the very reason that you are so thoroughly powerful and your people are so thoroughly powerless.  Indeed, when I accidentally wreck havok (see above notes regarding the interface), I tend to feel bad about my actions and I find that I want to do something to set things right.  I suspect that, for many people, the game is going to be a moral ink-blot.
I can't over-stress the problems with the interface.  I can understand why that would suffice to drive a person away from the game.  It's also true that the game has stability issues (thank the avatars that I had a spare computer to install it on; it simply locked on the livingroom system in spite of all efforts).  But it's also true that there is much to love about this game and, if nothing else, I would encourage people to buy it just to support this style of game and this level of creativity in game design.

Description: What path will you choose? The highly anticipated and arguably over-hyped fantasy/ adventure game from an extended Microsoft developer. This unique game claims to have extreme character versatility and game possibilities. Your appearance and skills will be altered by things you do in game. If you eat too much you get fat if you fight a lot you will get large and brawny and you also age. Fight the forces of evil or join them. You can adventure with thieves or settle into domesticity with your new wife (male or female.)

Platform: Xbox

Learning Curve: 7- With so much to do in the game expect to spend some time familiarizing yourself with the many skills and spells and also basic social interaction. I don't think you need to have ""1337 g4/\/\3R"" skills to fight and advance in the game, but the fighting system might take a bit of practice and the game gives you tutorials early in the game.

Replay Value: 9- The standard storyline will have the limitations of what it is, but if you stray from the intended path you can play the game many times altering your persona to be good or evil. Slaughter merchants or be a dastardly polygamous the possibilities can go on and on.

Difficulty: 5- This game has an average level of difficulty from what I can tell. With proper training and skill purchase most enemies shouldn't pose a problem.

Guide: Available through Prima publishers for $14.99. I'm surprisingly satisfied with this guide so far. The guide helps navigate the game easier and might help you get through some puzzles if you are stumped.

Pros: Versatile gameplay, awesome graphics, hilarious dialogue, addictive gameplay, and interesting follow through storyline.

Cons: Main character is as imagined ""generic"" to permit versatile play, camera angle with bow can get jumbled, D button controls are sloppy, and ""noble"" heroes will have to be careful for villagers wanting a part in battles with monsters and I often found myself accidentally hacking the occasional merchant.

Time Expected to Invest: As much time as you want, but I imagine most people will find a good month or so of solid play before they are off to another title. I think I will enjoy this title for a bit longer though.

Retail Value: $49.99

Suggested Purchase Price: worth over $40. Try to find it used if possible or wait until the price goes down.

Overall: 9- I admit I really like this game, but I'm trying to keep the casual gamer and expectations in mind when I rated this over all. I think some will be disappointed by the gameplay not being as ""versatile"" as many thought it would be, but really if there wasn't some kind of guided story involved for more ""linear"" gamers you'd just have a pet character on a game that would wonder around aimlessly with no direction. I like the option to do either in this game and I think many gamers will feel the same. Was this game too overly hyped? Perhaps, but I am still satisfied with the outcome. Is it a disappointment? No, disappointment is getting ready for the second time for a lunch date only to have the person inform you when they call that they are too ""tired"" to meet that commitment. I swear I had to get ready, drive into the city, and wait until she got off again and then... sorry off topic. Anyway, no I was satisfied by this game and that is enough for me to consider my purchase worthwhile. I recommend this title and I think while not ""revolutionary"" the game brings something new and fresh to gaming.",I'm satisfied due to reasonable expectations.,1095724800,140,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},
4.0,False,"02 8, 2005",A3EK57ZHMA55G5,B00009WAUO,Lestor neeker Wong,"A fat plumber called Mario was quite the icon during my childhood days. In those days, you weren't cool unless you played a Super Mario Bros. game or two. Super Mario Bros. 3 was one such games, and it was no doubt one of the most popular games in Nintendo's 100-odd-years history.

Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 is almost an exact replica of that game. Porting the game over to the GBA, Nintendo has made some minor changes to the it, but the large part of it remains essentially the same old of old. Which makes it a rather nostalgic run down the memory lane for gamers from the 80s' era, who are still gaming. Like me.

For the uninformed, the mission of Mario and Co. is simple. You will need to save a Princess (duh!), and to do that, you will need to battle through different levels in nine worlds. Going through all the worlds painstakingly is not compulsory though, if you happen to be strategic with some items you collect along the way, but the more accomplished Mario fans will tell you there's more fun in doing it ""the right way"".

Of course, doing it that way means a very long, and sometimes tough journey. You get upgrades when the game progresses, allowing you to change into various costumes. One of these is a raccoon suit that allows you to sweep your enemies with your tail, and to fly up to the sky. Pretty nifty, if you ask me. Other costumes lets you split fire, swim faster in water and throw hammers, etc. All of these give you some advantage in certain situations, but knowing when, and how to use them effectively is a different story.

Graphics wise, the colors look every bit as vibrant as they were, but the pictures are a little short when compared to modern standards. This has always been a problem with porting classic games onto the GBA. Still, I'm not a fussy person. Graphics have never been an issue for me when it comes to games, or I'd have bought an XBox.

The audios in this game are ok, although the music sounds like it has been remixed. Some of the in-game comments are a little corny, for example, when Mario gets a costume upgrade, he yells out: ""That's what I needed!"". This gets old after, like, two minutes. The special effect audios are as good as ever, so you get the classic ""ting"" sound when you latch onto coins, and the robotic tunnel-climbing sound when you get into one of those secret tubes, which is cool.

The changes in this version of Super Mario Bros. 3 now allow you to save your change. A welcomed move, surely, but the game is so easy, you probably won't need the feature if you intend to go through it speedily with the magic whistles. Oh, did I say magic whistles? Ok, I shall shut up. Other additions include five advance medallions per level, and a chance to take on the classic Mario Bros. game. If you're just buying this game for Super Mario Bros/ 3, you may conveniently ignore all these.

In conclusion, Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 is a classic revisited. It's an adventure with the qualities to impress fans, whether young or old, and will no doubt add hours of fun for you on the GBA. This is a game truly worthy of the Super Mario Bros. franchise.",Do not underestimate the powers of a fat plumber.,1107820800,2,,

This made me realize, ""Wow.  This game may one day go extinct.""  I'm sure its available on some emulators somewhere, or maybe one of those 120 games in 1 deals, but it just loses its significance when its not in cartridge form I think.

So playing this again 20 years after I rented it and finally beating the thing (yeah, I'm going to count Game A as winning because Game B is just too darn hard) was actually somewhat depressing for me.  Stuff that I once experienced as brand new is deteriorating with age.  As fun as Kung Fu is to play, who's going to go out of their way to hunt this obsolete title down when they have the newest Final Fantasy games flashing in their faces?

This is definitely one of the best games on the most important video game system ever made.  Its very, very easy to play.  Perhaps one of the easiest to play games you'll ever find, other than Cruisin' USA.  Jumping can be somewhat of a pain but other than that the controls are very smooth.  Dodging attacks can be extremely tough but the ease of the controls helps you out a whole lot.  That's the main thing that makes this such a great game.  Quality controls.  I even like its classic first-generation NES graphics.  Its just like Excitebike.

But, like I said, the newer games with the better graphics and enhanced play control options (lets face it, you can do more things with 8 buttons on a control pad than 2) are now greatly overshadowing simple games like this one.  Not that that's a bad thing.  Its just nice to feel stuck in time every once in a while...",An Epiphany,1183420800,8,,

Played through it in 1 sitting. Was really excited about the second one but was ultimately worried that my expectations were too high and that somehow i would be disappointed. Well... that s not the case. It even exceeded my expectations. Graphically it is a breathtakingly beautiful masterpiece especially if it's on an HD tv. I doubt that in the months to come that a game will be able to top its graphics (at least until Heavy Rain comes out). The action stays the same but as they say if it ain't broke don't fix it. The fighting is slightly refined and the stealth mode is a wonderful addition although it gets kind of frustrating sometimes. A helpful little addition is the aiming reticle while blindfiring which was missing from the first. The story is even better than drake's fortune and the scenery is varied as opposed to jungles and underground catacombs in the 1st one also. Although i would prefer more challenging puzzles they did a good job on that too.  Overall, they managed to put together something bigger and better and well worth all the hype it has been getting.

I ussualy wasn't one to play too many baseball sims as they got too complex or tedious but this game is just right for me and all of you others like me who think baseball is kind of a slow game. All your favorite carachters are here and thensome. We have Mario, Wario, Peach etc. but we also have some obscurities like King Toadstool and Trixie Kong. Each carachter has their own specialty (other than balanced players i.e. Mario, Power players are good at hitting hard and pitching hard and fast but tend to be slow runners. Speed players tend to be good fielders and baserunners but average hitters and pitchers. Then there are technique players which as far as I can tell excell in pitching and are ok at everything else. Each player also has their own star power that when tapped into allows the player to hit or pitch with cool powers like a flame ball for Mario. That isn't the only piece of Mario flavor that finds itself in the game. Every field has it's own obstacle that is ussualy a staple in the series such as piranha plants that eat and spit out your ball. This game has the full range of modes but nothing really worth talking about. Over all this is a great great game for those of you looking for a simple fun sports game or a young baseball fan who wants a video game that is easy to play.

I beat it in under 6 hours my first (and only) time through.  From what I've heard and read, 5-10 hours is average.  In other words, don't expect the weeks of entertainment the packaging promises...
So, onto the basic premise of the game.  You're a young boy named Rion.  You wake up in a lab with no memories and an array of psychic abilities, apparently received while you were the unwilling subject for some sort of experimentation.  You begin the game by escaping your restraints and trying to win your freedom.  As you progress through the game's 4 areas, the story unfolds through character interactions and beautiful movies and images usually triggered by some sort of psychic flashback or intuition related to various objects and locations.
The gameplay basically involves battles (that are usually few and far between) and puzzle solving (mostly of the ""find items and keys and figure out where to use them"" variety).  Your main weapons in battle are your psychic abilities, enhanced by chemicals called PPECs.  You start out with 2 offensive abilities.  Nalcon allows you to send sort of an attack wave ...  You'll get a 3rd ability (albeit a fairly useless one) halfway through the game.  So, you're basically left with 2 fairly weak main attacks, each taking more than one hit at full power to take out all but the simplest of enemies.
The game's weapon and healing systems all rely on drugs.  You have certain amounts of offensive drugs in your system.  When they run low, you have to inject yourself with more.  When your health runs low, pop a pill.  You also have ""anger points"" that rise just from walking around and rise more rapidly when you use psychic powers.  This is due to the interaction of drugs in your system, and when the AP meter gets to high, you ""short"", which is basically a psychic overdose that leaves you walking around with a big migraine.  The plus side:  Every enemy you go near while shorting will die violently.  The negative side:  Your health will go south rather quickly until you stop the shorting by taking a pill called delmetor.
Enemy battles are usually easy, except for a handful of very difficult end bosses that take a while to defeat and a few instances where enemies attack you 3 at a time, leaving you frustratingly unable to fight back.  Strategy is limited, usually involving running around in circles until you have enough time to charge your powers and attack.
As for the graphics and sound, they're both excellent for the Playstation.  The general game graphics are nice, sharp, and detailed.  The movies (which are the reason the game spans 3 discs) are also quite impressive.  The sound is excellent, from eerie music down to the footsteps that let you know an enemy is pacing around the corner...
The controls..well..they're annoying.  If you've never played a survival horror game, the stiff controls will prove to be a great annoyance.  If you're a survival horror veteran, they'll be a familiar annoyance.  Having to charge up your psychic powers in order to attack with any effectiveness adds to the frustration as it's sometimes hard to target fast moving enemies while charging, leading you to miss often and waste your PPECs..
Overall, I'd say don't buy this game, rent it.  It's a rather enjoyable game with a great storyline and entertaining puzzles.  However, as I stated earlier, it will only last you a couple nights, and since the main thrill of the game is following the storyline and figuring out the puzzles, it has practically no replay value.",An enjoyable survival sci-fi game with some flaws,1031702400,5,,

I am used to playing Sega's World Series Baseball series on the Dreamcast and personally think both series' are basically equal except that High Heat's Franchise mode is a little more in-depth.
Graphically this game is awesome. The players look like the real life players and their pitching styles and batting stances are head on.
The gameplay in this game is pretty good. Pitching involves pressing one of four buttons for a certain pitch and square if you want it to be outside of the strike zone or circle if you want it to be in the zone. One thing I think that should be in the pitching is to be able to aim where you pitch like you can in World Series Baseball. Fielding is very simple using all four buttons to throw to a certain base. And a great feature in this is being able to rob homeruns without having to press several buttons. But fielding is a pain for some people, having to use the control pad instead of the analog stick often screws you up and you can't tell where you are going. It is also almost impossible to throw out a runner attempting to steal unless you are a veteran at this game.
The Franchise mode in this game is equally as good as WSB 2K2 and better in some ways. Fro trading, to retirements, to free agent signings to rookie drafts, to minor leagues, it's all here in the Franchise Mode where you have total control over your team. You can choose to play with the real rosters or do a fantasy draft which is like being in a fantasy baseball league, except you get to play the games. This is my favorite mode in this game.

The controller is great its self the buttons are very responsive and, the 360 layout (reversed analog sticks) are very easy to get use to. The controller changes to seven different colors yellow, dark blue, pink, red, green, light blue, and lastly white. The L1,R1,L2,R2 button are very good i actually prefer them over my dualshock. Unfortunately like all third party controllers this one isn't perfect. The complaints i have are one, it requires a dongle receiver and with the slim the only room i have is for 1 charging cord and the dongle. The second complaint i have is the start and select layout it has five buttons shaped like a bat that go battery life check, select, home, start, and the color changing button, to me it should have the start and select buttons as the outer buttons.
My last complaint is more of a misunderstanding i suppose, on the back it says custom L2,R2 triggers what i thought they meant was you can flip the L1,R1 with L2,R2 but I'm guessing what they mean is the curve in the R2,L2 triggers, which is kind of a bummer seeing as the R2,L2s are more comfortable.

Little did I know that it would still be enertaining and addicting for repeated plays 8 years later. Being so young, it took me a while to catch on to the game. It would take me so many game years to build a farm and earn money for a family. But the more I learned and understood the game, the more I learned to love the characters and their stories. I have heard people say the characters in this game are one dementional and have no personality but I beg to differ. Your shipper falls in love with a married woman, a homeless man struggles to stay in town and deal with his past, a young nurse must help raise her little brother properly, etc. Over the years I have found myself more attached and loving the whole town. So, for sentimental reasons this game is a total 5 out of 5 for me. But being serious...

  I love the farming in this game by far the most out of all of the Harvest Moon games. Some of the problems with later Harvest Moon games is being too complicated and difficult to earn money. This is the simple and basic farming system with just some added features. Chores don't take too long but they also don't take too short, giving you just enough time interact with your neighbors. One problem I did have is that the horse is too hard to actually ship crops with. If you try to use him he runs away. You are better of just using a basket. Also, the dog never actually uses his dog house. Which is pretty lame and weird if you ask me.

  Like I said above, I love the town in this game. While other games in the series have boring characters and plots, this does not. The town is beautiful and I have always loved the character animation. Courting the woman of your choice is one of the best parts of the game. It is fun triggering heart events and eventually starting a family with them. The only complaints I have are that sometimes the English writing will switch languages and there are grammar errors....what Harvest Moon game doesn't have this problem....? And, once you have a child the game is basically over. It never grows up and not much more happenes.

This time around though, Madden NFL 08 ends up being the best installment of the long running series to hit the DS yet, with EA making some vast improvements over previous incarnations of the series.  The first thing you'll notice is that the 3-D player models on the bottom screen of the DS are much improved this time around.  That being said, they still might not be a whole lot to look at, but the game does look better in the graphics department this year overall.  The control scheme has also seen some tweaks, as has the overall gameplay and various play modes as well.  Not to mention that the Wi-Fi capability also ends up being one of the best features of Madden NFL 08, and is every bit as fun as it should be.  What really hurts Madden NFL 08 though ends up being the small amount of glitches that plague the overall game.  These glitches appear in the form of the game's graphics engine as well as the opponent AI (which is also quite forgiving at times, but then again, this is Madden after all) and are quite noticable as well.  Not to mention that the play by play commentary is hardly as prolific as what it could be, so don't expect to hear a whole lot from the man himself while you play.  Negatives aside, Madden NFL 08 ends up being the best Madden game to hit the DS yet, and for football fans that own a DS and are craving a more than solid NFL game (like you have any other choice), then look no further.",The best Madden on the DS yet,1188172800,19,,

In a console generation that has been saturated with overhype, borderline false advertisement, and rushed games not ready for launch upon release, I have finally found a game that would fully justify a next gen console purchase for those that are on the fence. CD PROJEKT RED knocked this one out of the park despite two substantial delays. In my opinion, the delays are simply a sign that they were not willing to release a product until it was the best it could possibly be.

If you enjoyed Skyrim, Dragon Age, Game of Thrones or even Red Dead Redemption you will likely love this title. You will become quickly immersed in the developer (not procedurally) created world and deep story telling. If you have not been following the studio's behavior pre-release, they have set the standard for proper customer service and how to release a game properly. They did not street date the game until it was ready, distributed review copies well ahead of launch, and even provided multiple goodies in the standard physical editions of the game as a thank you for purchasing. 16 FREE DLC packages have already been announced for the future, but if money is tight you will literally find hundreds of hours of immersion in this game alone.

With the time I have been allotted to play, the story is beautiful, with clear direction and unmatched story telling. What really sets this game apart, is the desire to explore and the wonderful things you find and can do while doing so. Just today (story spoiler free) I was on what I thought to be a small side quest to help a villager find a family member, when on the way back after completion I was ambushed, found intel on one of the attackers that led to a hideout, and then a small boss at that location that led to quite the fight. Keep in mind this was all separate from the main story!

I personally am not a huge fan of RPGs as I spend most of my time in first person shooters, but I can tell this game will likely have my attention at least until the holiday season. CD PROJEKT RED has restored my faith in gaming and a developers ability to make games for the gamer. I highly recommend this title for anyone who enjoys quality games and wonderful stories, and hope that if nothing else you support a quality developer in a market saturated with greed and shady practices. Yes, the resolution is improved on the PS4 and maxed out PCs, but I assure you that my experience with this title on the Xbox One has been nothing short of magical and it is still a gorgeous world to explore.",An absolute masterpiece in a console generation filled with disappointment,1431993600,122,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It was hyped up beyond belief and then was a glorified GTA which was not what I was looking for. The story line was also dark and not engaging - I wanted something like the Last of Us and was left with Titanfall.

I'm so glad I didn't let me previous opinion sway me, this game is a blast to play. Looking at graphics and gameplay:

GRAPHICS 10/10
Again, Ubisoft did an incredible job here. Everything from the shadows, your characters strut while holding a gun, to cut scenes, it is all masterfully done. This one of the best graphics you'll see in a game, especially actual game play.

GAMEPLAY 9/10
Giant improvement here. It is still very much like GTA but the improved story gives you a purpose, not to mention a better attachment to the characters. I find myself laughing often as the characters are hilarious. Even the missions are better, not just ""go hack that guy over there"". Just so much more engaging, it can be as linear or open world as you want it to be. One of the subtle changes that I really enjoyed was the use of your cell phone for everything...missions, map, music, and even downloading apps needed for the game.  It really adds to the hacker feel.

CONCLUSION
Whether or not you liked the first Watch Dogs is not important in making a decision to purchase this game or not. The history behind the first one is also not needed.

It's simple, if you're looking for a fun game with top-notch graphics and an enjoyable/funny storyline with characters that are relatable or you can form an attachment to, this game is a must have.

I had played around with the other versions long ago, but they didn't grip me like this. It starts similarly to the others (getting indebted to Tom Nook) and the gameplay is similar, but the fact that it felt like a full home console version of Animal Crossing on a mobile device really helped it for me. I think part of why previous iterations put me off is that the kind of play I would do (daily check-ins) are more conducive to small play sessions in bed, while commuting, during breaks, etc., not necessarily while sitting in front of the TV.

The graphics are great; looks like the Gamecube version shrunk down. Im sure they could be improved, but I think they are in a good spot as they are. This was one area that hurt Wild World a bit (the DS version of Animal Crossing).

The gameplay is pretty simplistic, slow-paced, and relaxing. You have a small set of actions you can do (digging, cutting, catching bugs, planting flowers, etc). The main meat of the game is split between several areas: collecting, customization, bell acquisition, and NPC interaction. For customization, this means placing major landmarks or improvements, pathways, creating custom patterns for various purposes, etc. and performing other duties as the acting mayor. Bell acquisition would be getting fruits from other towns for selling, cultivating gold trees, catching rare bugs. NPC interaction normally results in short quests for you to complete. Collecting is woven into all of these facets (e.g. you can sell fossils or donate them to the museum collection). There are lots of little activities to do each day and the town progresses as you play it.

This game is definitely worth a look if you have been interested in slow-paced games in the past like Harvest Moon. It is a great slice of a peaceful little world.",A wonderful window into a quiet world,1463529600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I saw potential for many mini side quests, a pretty good fighting system and like others have said, you can move while battling. The controls were set up nicely and were easy to use. If you position yourself so that the enemy is in a column or row, you can hit multiple enemies in one strike (so don't bunch up your team. What goes around comes around). It also has skill strikes, level ups, weapon build ups, etc. Yes, it's similar to FF games but it's a great set up. Excellent graphics and sound abound.
The only bad thing I saw is small. They had this big opening with dialog but when you begin your quests and speak to other key people, you're stuck ready text. It'd be nice if you talk to a key person in the game, you could hear it. When you talk to random city dwellers it could be text. This way, you know when you're getting important info.

There are occasional glitches (graphic freezes and graphical anomalies such as your character singing into an invisible microphone) and it just feels like not much work was put into it. It just isn't nearly as much fun as Rock Band, and the pitch recognition in Rock Band is a lot more accurate. The biggest problem with this game is pitch recognition - at the low end of my voice the game just doesn't respond accurately, no matter how I adjust the mic settings. There's also quite a noticeable delay between singing and hearing your voice through the TV speakers, something that is inexcusable for a karaoke game. These are all thing Rock Band got just right, so why is this game so buggy?

The real American Idol judges all provide their voices to this game but the character models look eerily lifeless. You'll quickly start getting repeated comments. While fun at first, the American Idol schtick does start to get a bit tiresome, although thankfully there is an option to just sing without hearing the judges at the end.

On the plus side, there is a good selection of songs (mostly pop/rock) and plenty more to come via downloadable content (42 available as of March 12th 2008). You can customise your characters' costume with loads of outfits and there are quite a few ""venues"" where you can sing. There are a few unlockable videos of actual American Idol song clips and interviews with the judges about the game.

I had a lot of fun playing and beating this game, yet when I was done, I uninstalled it and moved on.  Why?  Bioshock is ultimately undermined by the very thing that makes it good in the first place: its carefully crafted storyline and well-planned first player campaign.

The GOOD: Terrific graphics, especially the water and fire effects.  This game is not lacking for eye candy, IF you have the hardware.  The sound is similarly stunning, and used very, very well by the developers.  The art direction (the whole art deco concept) is masterfully executed.  The concept--alone in an abandoned underwater utopia gone wrong--is also creative, fun, and used to the full extent.  There are some genuinely scary moments, though F.E.A.R is still scarier than this game.  The plasmid powers are the equivalent of magic in Role-Playing games, and the Tonics function like experience points.  The U-Invent machines are a nice touch, though the whole vending machine bit was overdone.  Overall, there are some genuinely fun moments in this game.

The BAD: The story is ultimately pretty weak and trite as well as very, very linear.  At the end I didn't care what was going on, I just wanted to finish the game--that's never a good sign.  There is zero replay value.  I don't care about the lack of multiplayer, but having been spoiled by wide-open, living universes such as Oblivion, the linear, level-to-level design of Bioshock felt limiting and dated.  You don't ever explore Rapture as much as you are guided through it by game designers.  I also feel as if the half RPG/half shooter aspect of the game hurts it.  The plasmid powers are scaled so that you are never really more powerful than your enemies.  That's right, one of the most fun aspects of RPG--leveling up and beating up on baddies--is negated by the scaled difficulty.  The Big Daddy fights are also repetitive as anything, and nowhere near as fluid and inventive as advertised.  The alarms and alarm bots are as annoying as the cliff racers from Morrowind, and a regrettable inclusion on the part of the developers.

BOTTOM LINE:  This is a beautiful game that was very, very well executed.  Yet, as always, the innovation and novelty was exaggerated by the media, and at the end of the day, this is essentially a linear, scripted shooter with a predictable story and some half-baked RPG elements thrown in.

~Strengthen Your Heart focuses on high blood pressure
~Active Kids is targeted at preventing  childhood obesity
~Aging With Grace is designed to help the eldery with mobility & agility
As an out-of-shape senior, I'm not spending as much time with this program as I should.  I began with the Strengthen Your Heart program. It tired me out yet wasn't too hard for me to follow. I checked out the Active Kids program which seemed to have some of the same exercises as  Strengthen Your Heart.

I thoroughly enjoyed the Stack 'Em Up game & was fairly successful at catching & balancing the falling shapes. As a matter of fact, I beat my 23 yr. old daughter a few times until she got better & started beating me. My arms didn't get tired at all. I played  for quite a long time.

I was disappointed with Run the World; the graphics weren't at all what I expected them to be. I was expecting to enjoy the sites as I 'fast walked', not ran,  through NYC.  I don't know how to explain  the graphics, just that, they were computer generated, & I wasn't impressed with them. When I passed an important/interesting landmark, etc., a tour guide gave a brief description & a small photo of the landmark popped up on the screen.

I had fun with Wall Breaker & was fairly successful as I punched through walls of bricks & blocks. I'm a wild puncher & really wear myself out when I play these kinds of games. It was fun; even more fun when I beat my daughter a few times.

  This game has several programs to choose from: Body Focus Workouts (these target specific areas, such as arms, abs, back, glutes & more), sports preparation programs,  high energy African Rhythm dance routines, Bollywood (so much fun!), Latin Dance, Hip Hop, Yoga, Cardio Boxing, Boot Camp,  Zen Zone (inspired by Tai Chi & Yoga), and if this list doesn't have enough choices for you...there's more.

I think the game would've been better had they cleaned it up a bit and showed more focus. The combat is completely changed from the first one. It's more action oriented which I don't really have a problem with but it's basically a cover shooter. Everywhere you go there's plenty of cover and it over does it with the corridors. Basically you have sections cut up on the hub worlds. A section to walk around in and talk and do missions. And a section just for combat. I don't like this as it feels like you're restricted and it feels cheap. I much prefer the wide open areas of the first game. Which brings me to another issue is certain places in the game just aren't as good as the first. Remember the citadel from the first game? That's one of the best and most interesting locations for any game ever. But the citadel here is nowhere near as good. The locations are cramped and less inspired it seems than in the first.

Next I have to mention the complete and utter waste of hacking and scanning. These are gameplay elements that could've went to something else. Instead we are constantly hacking and the hacking is pointless because it's impossible to fail and it never evolves. The scanning is equally bad as it just screams a bad and wasted gameplay element. It's essentially a missed opportunity to include something more interesting and worthwhile. There's too much of it and they didn't need to do that. When you have a problem with the Mako from ME1 you shouldn't cut it out for something worse, it should be improved or changed into something better.

Next, the story. The story was executed well enough for what they had but it's very choppy and unfocused. It focuses much more on the characters, who are awesome, but it takes the focus away from the reapers. We get more of a side story that focuses on different things you probably didn't expect it to. It's not terrible, just probably not what you planned on doing in a ME game.

The games strengths are it's characters, it's music, it's side quests, and it's production values. The game takes a noticeably darker approach in nearly every way and that's something that many people will love. My main problem is that it takes a completely different direction from the first. It's much more Hollywood and less of the interesting and awe-inspiring Sci-Fi world that the first game was going for.

Let's take a moment to talk about the game's most distinguished merit: Graphics. Now, just because the graphics are my favourite part of this game doesn't mean that you should expect the most ""advanced"" visuals. What is great about what you will see is that you probably haven't seen anything quite like it.

Sure, you've played sidescrollers and seen Japanese-style cartoon characters but screenshots just don't tell the whole story here. The characters have a motion that somehow allows a 2D cartoon character to come alive. Beyond that, there is just an enormous amount of detail poured into the environments that you just don't see in other 2D realms.

That said, there are just a number of flaws that bring this would-be giant to its knees. I'll only focus on the most important: Gameplay. Be prepared to be frustrated. When you first start out, you will be puzzled by seemingly unresponsive button presses. As you play you will learn that presses just don't register while the character is carrying out the current action. What this amounts to is slowly and carefully timing your buttons with the animations, which is incredibly counter intuitive and clumsy- especially when you have five to ten bad guys bum-rushing you at high speed. Your natural tendency is to mash away, which will ultimately result in your demise.

In the end, this game may be worth the bargain price, but only as a whimsical (and short) diversion for those dry spells between major new releases.

It has many different levels, so there is no shortage of variety. There are many types of guns and several gadgets. The real fun comes in the form of the driving and rail shooting levels. There is one level that puts you in the driver's seat of an Aston Martin DB5 and you race through the streets of Budapest. Your car comes equipped with all manner of cool weapons including rockets (for taking out enemy cars) and missiles (for taking out enemy helicopters). That level also features a rail shooting area where you are in a Soviet tank armed with a cannon and a chain gun. This is my favorite level of the game.
The regular ""walk around"" levels are pretty good as well. The enemies (in my experience) seem to be a little dumb. You can walk right up behind them and pop 'em off before they even know you're there. Like many shooters you might not feel the need to play it very often, but for the price you'll likely pay, you don't have to feel bad about getting it.
Last word: Agent Under Fire is a fine shooter, in particular if you don't want massive blood and guts. The ""victims"" fall down without any sign of a wound, and disappear in a few seconds. There is a good selection of levels and weapons, and many different things to do after you finish the last level (for example I believe there are other levels you can unlock if you obtain all the ""Golden Rewards"".

 The amount of content in the game is insane for a Pokemon game with many of the wifi only Pokemon from Pokemon Black/White, being available without dumb downloads. There are familiar characters, places, and all new areas and a new team of villians to take over the world and are the ones responsible for freezing the land. You can discover the secret of Kyurem and learn of his special ability. You can travel to new cities and areas. The amount they added to the map is almost doubling the original game. It is now flooded with trainers to make leveling up very fast and easy. The new Elite 4 arenas are really cool as well!

 Unlike the other Japanese Pokemon games, I recommend learning some Japanese before playing this game because there were I think 3 places where you actually needed to read the Japanese text. Since this game is region-coded, in order to use PokeTransfer, you will need a Japanese version of a previous game to send them over (Diamond to Black2), but you can trade any region of Black/White to Black2.

4.0,True,"05 27, 2012",A19KM8VJZS5Q7L,B0015HZLVA,Anton,"I am years behind on this review but I felt like I should write one, mainly because every other game review I seem to produce on Amazon is either bad or merely decent.

A year or two ago I got my home theater set up and I was trying to decide on which RPG to get into for the 360 (I'm a pretty big RPG fan). Sadly, there isn't a large selection for the Xbox so it didn't take me long to find competition between a few titles. I won't list any other possible selections because I haven't played them, although it should be noted that there are some other RPGs and even JRPGs out there with good or very good reviews as well (as you can see Tales has very good reviews here).

I am a traditional kind of RPG player (I enjoy games such as Final Fantasy 1,6,7, Xenogears, Lunar Silver Star Story Complete, Chrono Trigger) although I am open to anything with a good story, graphics and sound. One of the first things that really appealed to me about Tales is the beautifully crafted artwork. As others have mentioned, the game consists of cell shading, and while the graphics are relatively simple, they remain very vibrant and fun to view. I found the villages very comforting, and even the dungeon-type landscapes were still nice to look at. Also, I thought the camera angles were original and made the experience unique. For example, while running down a stairway, the camera will sometimes follow right behind you, so you really gain a depth of perception into the setting.

The music was also enjoyable. It has been years now since I played it but I still find that I remember many of the tracks. It was also nice on my surround system because some of the background effects (such as running water or blowing wind) were truly surround. Audio is one of the biggest aspects for a game to me and Tales does well in this department, albeit they also play it relatively safe.

Although there is a large open world with a traditional world map, I did find the game in general as relatively linear. Not in pacing or completing missions or the storyline, but in the layouts of platforms and dungeons and paths. What I mean is, everywhere you encounter enemies (other than the world map) is a bunch of small paths in which you take them left or right, up or down. This effect is more easily experienced than explained. However, due to the beauty of the landscapes, I was able to look past this flaw for the most part.

While the villages and environments are beautifully stunning, I found that most of the large cities were not quite as explorable as I had wished. You may enter a few buildings and participate in a few side quests, but for the most part the huge metropolises are pretty much inaccessible for you. While some games I feel present TOO much to explore and other areas of the game suffer for this, I feel as though Tales of Vesperia was shortcoming in variety and being able to really become a part of the settings in which you explore. Sure, there are minute side quests and interactions with NPCs, but I feel that there could have been much more. For example, think of the Gold Saucer in Final Fantasy VII. Well, Tales offers an island in the game much like it, and really, it is more or less an equivalent to the Gold Saucer. Actually, the FF7 recreation area was probably MORE in depth, and it was released in 1997! Of course, Final Fantasy VII was a masterpiece and lives as one of the great JRPGs, but still, Tales of Vesperia released over ten years later. While the graphics may have improved, the overall immersion in the environments was little or not improved from a decade prior. I did, however, become addicted to playing the poker on the island, and it is also a great way to make money in the game.

The fighting is somewhat dissimilar from traditional RPGs in that it is not turn based, and you have the ability to run around a three-dimensional sphere as a combat area. While it is relatively primitive, the battles are rather fun. I like the option of being able to put the other party members on auto, so your healers and magic casters will stand in the back of the battle (hopefully!) and cast as you choose to physically attack (which is what I most often did). There are ""fatal strikes"", which are basically death-blows and they are the most fun thing in the combat to me. And throughout the game, including boss battles, I felt as though the battles were hard enough to be competitive but not horribly unfair. I rather enjoyed fighting many of the big monster bosses, which often were completely optional for the player.

I think the biggest drawback to Tales of Vesperia is the story. It is only good enough to keep you playing, and actually many of the other perks in the game (such as the fighting and artwork) probably kept me playing more so than the storyline. And this is an RPG we're talking about. While I rather enjoyed all of the characters (even Karol!) and all of their dialogues, I felt that the main story was weak and that the conclusion of the game was severely disappointing. All of the ideas that I had in my head about how the game would end came crashing to a halt when I finally completed the game. I think I was looking for more of a dialogue between my characters of which I'd come to love, and in that department Tales pretty much let me down.

There are other aspects in the game (such as cooking, fighting in arenas or finding rare collectibles) that were enjoyable, but again they were pretty much tertiary and did not leave me with a feeling of accomplishment. Cooking for example could have developed into something really fun and novel, but in the end it was kind of a letdown.

Overall, I still rate this game at over four stars. If you enjoy RPGs that are aesthetically pleasing and traditional, Tales of Vesperia is a great choice for you. I actually traded my game in and I wish that I had kept it now, if only to jump on every once in a while and listen to the soundtrack and fight some battles. Namco did a great job with this title and I would look forward to another in the future, as long as the storyline comes off as a little more compelling.",Somewhere between 4 and 4.5 Stars for Me,1338076800,,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

First I'll start with the positives.
This thing handles nes,snes and genesis carts through three different slots on top. As well as supports all the respective consoles original controllers if you wish.

It even has a region switch on the front panel so you could change it to play famicon games or super famicon games.

I personally like the design of this I bought the white/blue one and it just looks sleek. The front panel cover the hides the controller ports is a really nice design feature.

It gives you two snes style controllers which match your color scheme. These hook into the genesis ports but will work on all three consoles. You cannot use an original snes controller on this and have it work with say the genesis games.  You would either have to use the supplied controllers or get a genesis controller.

I can confirm that the super everdrive works with this. I do not own a genesis or Nintendo everdrive but am told those work with this as well.

Every game I have tested on this works. Even unsupported games like bible adventures I was pleasantly surprised work with this console.

Lastly I have hooked this to an hdtv that has composite inputs. This does not look as good as it would on an older crtv but it looks just as good as the original consoles would hooked to my tv and the sound has been just fine. I have heard others complain that the sound was not accurate. I have not experienced this and it could just be I do not have the affected games.

Now the so so's
Firstly the controllers. While these are by far the best clone console controllers I have ever used they are not as good as an original Nintendo or sega controller. For how much this thing costs though, these things are great and most will not have a problem.

The cartridge slots are really tight.  While this is good as it ensures your carts are making a good connection. Removing them or putting them in makes you feel like you're almost breaking this thing.

Lastly the console is very light and definitely feels cheap. But again I reference the price of this thing,  you can't really expect plastic quality to be the same as a current gen system.

To close this up for the under $60 price tag this thing is amazing. I have checked out retrons and this is better. The fact that it is cloned hardware not a system that runs emulators like the retron means you have much more compatibility. If you want the ability to play all those old games that have been sitting in your attic but don't want to go out and buy three consoles and take up that space you really can't do better than the super retro trio.",You really can't beat this price for what you get.,1433548800,5,,

This game is no different - it is quite enjoyable and has a good storyline - although there are 2 probs I have with it. 1) had to updated with latest patch to get it to work despite my having a new copy and a sick machine.  2) there seems to be more story/cutscenes than actual game play/fighting.  I didn't mind the car driving, but there was more than I expected, and I haven't even finished the game yet (level 7) I only played this game as I could no longer stand the hype and had to find out what it was all about.

Vader sends you out to dispose of a few surviving Jedi and in the process, you discover the light side and become aware of the deceptive nature of the sith.

Gameplay: The gameplay gets you as close to the experience of being ""in the movie"" as possible.  Its a third-person hack and slash at its core, however there are some platformer-esque elements integrated throughout. Combat is dominated by lightsaber attacks and combos however ranged force attacks (lighting, grip, repulse, etc...) are also essential to gameplay. Its fun and relatively easy to string together multiple lightsaber combo attacks or use the force to push enemies off of cliffs, etc.  While the gameplay is well thought out and implemented with good effort, there are certain aspects of the combat system that are incredibly frustrating.  First, the camera control (right analog stick) can become burdensome when fighting bosses or large masses of enemies.  Alternatively, you can lock on to a single target (the camera will follow you in combat) however the lock on mechanism fails repeatedly throughout the game.  There were several instances, for example, where I was targeting an object on the wall instead of the boss in front of me.  If you can learn to accept these little annoyances, the gameplay is very fun and very addicting.

Other notes: If you buy the original version of the game (not the Ultimate Sith Edition) you will need to spend $40.00 on downloadable content for the PS3 in order to be able to earn 100% of the trophies for the game. I suggest if you want to 100% this game that you instead buy the Ultimate Sith Edition (3 extra missions)

What you do get are some interesting party motifs (Tikki, Country-Western, Rave) a couple of new items and some more group interaction.
Pros: Parties are easier to throw with the mass invite option.  It's much more time-efficient than calling up each individual person, or even using the party balloons.  Several items, like the campfire and bubble machine allow for more group interaction, making maintaining social relationships easier.  They also provide some interesting sound files featuring more SimSpeak (the nonsensical language your Sims speak) and SimSinging around the campfire.  Some practical additions object-wise (like smaller dining room tables for instance, which can replace the behemoths the first pack provided) also are welcome additions.
Cons: as other reviewers said, the game is a little buggy.  My game crashes every so often now, even though it never crashed before with the original or the Livin' Large expansion pack.  It doesn't run quite as smoothly as one would like.  I did take care to prepare my computer thoroughly (running scandisk and defrag) before installing, but I'm still having problems.

Best way to describe the The Legend of Kay is a mixed of Sly Cooper/Jack & Daxter and Kung Fu Panda. Like the Sly Cooper/Jack and Daxter games it's a 3D adventure platformer with battle elements sprinkled in. It has cutesy animal characters similar to those of the Kung Fu Panda films. The plot is pretty generic: gorillas invades the village and oppresses all the other animal races and imprison some of them. Kay stands up to fight them and saves his friends in the process. Even though rated 10+ there are some alcohol references, instead of beer and wine the alcoholic beverage in this game is dubbed nettlemead.

-Gameplay involves platforming, battle segments, light puzzle solving and riding animals.

Platforming is okay if it weren't for the horrible camera angles, where if there's a miss placed jump in a long platforming sequence, you may have to restart from a minute or two back.

Battle sequences suffer from the same problems as at times the camera decides to obstruct your view from what's happening. The battle system involves doing combos, blocking and dodging. The latter of the two requires timing and if you're down to your last life it's pretty frustrating when the camera starts misbehaving out of nowhere. There's no lock-on mode which may be troublesome in the endgame where there are mobs of enemies coming at you and you can't pinpoint an annoying enemy to take out first, this is especially troublesome when the camera decides to fight against you also. Combos are not attack based rather finisher based as dealing a final blow on an enemy activates a combo mode where you have to timed button presses to string attacks.

Puzzles in this game is pretty simple. It either involves pushing blocks, hitting the right trigger sequences or breaking a pile of pots into an arrow to your next destination to name a few. These puzzles are simple and fun to solve. They are not exactly brain teasers as with little thought it's easy to figure out, there was no time where I have to look for an online guide to figure out a puzzle. There are some exploration elements though, so you may have to scour every nook and cranny of the map at times to find a hidden item or switch to progress.

There are animal riding segments where you ride a boar through a timed obstacle courses.

All 4 gameplay elements sets a nice change of pace throughout the game, but the camera issues sometimes kills the mood.

-Voice acting in this game is horrible. You can tell they're reading from a script with no visual stimulants or passion. The conversations are not fluid and you can hear small pause transitions between audio tracks. The script is decent, but the voice actors lacks enthusiasm. The background music on the other hand is very good and catchy at times, wished the voice acting had the same treatment.

-The graphics are surprisingly good, you could tell it's a PS2 era game, but with a nice gloss over it running at 60 frames per seconds with minimal loading screen transitions.

-Extras are okay, you get concept art, videos and sketches for completing. For those on PS4 there are trophies, but there are some missable on the first playthrough as some are event triggered, so best to look through the trophy list unless you plan to play through this game multiple times.

Everything Red Dead Redemption did well, GTA IV screws up. The characters are annoying, the endless cell phone ringing and obligations to your friends and girlfriends are distracting. The graphics are boring and uninspired (again I know this game is a bit dated now). The people walking around are just mindless robots and don't actually interact much with the scenery. The map itself is ridiculously boring. Street after street after street, some with tall buildings some with short buildings, oh hey there's Chinatown... Not that they could do much with a downtown NYC atmosphere anyways, just a bad choice of game location.

All of these complaints could be tolerable if the missions were actually fun to play and progressed the story (there was a story?). Instead, you get ""Go shoot pool with Friend... Leave pool-hall drunk only to find your car has been moved down the street and you have to walk extremely slow in circles, drunk, to get back to it"" Fun! NOT

Or how about the countless ""Pick up this car and drive it from point A, clear across the map to point B""

Or my favorite ""Choose which guy that has had minimal affect on the story and your relation to the character to shoot and kill""

Oh and screw up one part of one of these missions and it's back to the other side of the map for you.

All in all the missions were just plain boring. There are so many subplots that you completely lose track of where the end is or what you are ultimately trying to accomplish.

5.0,True,"09 27, 2016",A1YKBSE9P3GDCA,B0007WWYLY,Tubsiwub,"Let's start this simple review.

Story Summary:
Haunting Ground is the story of a young 18 y.o. girl named Fiona Belli who has been trapped within the confines of a very scary castle that hosts a few frightful people.  These people chase and harass Fiona in different ways while she solves puzzles, finds key items to progress and looks for ways around the castle.  Fiona is accompanied by a canine companion named Hewie shortly after the game starts.

Gameplay Summary:
Fiona controls very simply.  You move her around with the control stick, she is able to run (but can get tired), and she has the ability to attack (weakly) by kicking or shoving.  There are lots of items in the game, but these are mostly key items for story progression or health/stamina recovery items.  There isn't much else to preoccupy your thought and there are no stats, health/stamina meters or lives to keep track of.  The game has no HUD and there is light background music to accompany your time in the castle.

The game has two states during gameplay:  Exploration and Hiding.  While exploring, you will constantly find yourself being found, and consequently chased, by Debilitas, an employee of the castle who has a child-like fascination with Fiona to a dangerous degree.  While being chased, Fiona goes into a panic at various states with these states ranging from Afraid to Full-Blown Freakout (after which you lose your full control of Fiona).  It is possible to die during these chase sequences, but the game is reasonably forgiving.

Some of the game's puzzles can kill the player if the player is not careful, or if the player does not have a decent level of foresight (in which, you better save quite often).  Saving can be done at clocks in the game, so the player cannot save at any point in time.

My Thoughts:
The game is eerie and spooky, but not full-blown horror.  It's an excellent game if you're looking for a good eerie experience exploring a scary place and getting chased by monstrous enemies, but the feeling of dread is not present in this title.  Unlike Resident Evil, Clock Tower, Eternal Darkness or other horror titles similar to Haunting Ground, the player will never feel truly alone or completely helpless.  This is in part due to Hewie, the dog, constantly being with you and allowing you, as Fiona, to have a reliable attack.  Along with this, various game mechanics, such as training Hewie with the ball, actively work against the fear that the game might have had.  Overall, this is definitely not a horror title that should be missed out on.

With the current prices, Haunting Ground should not be bought at $100+ and I actively recommend trying to find a lucky purchase at $80 or below, but the game is exceptional enough to warrant paying over launch-price for the title.

I give the game a 9/10.

Quick Pros:
 - The AI for Debilitas feels very authentic.  I truly enjoyed seeing him lose sight of me and actively search locations based on my movement, open/closed doors and my previous hiding spots.
 - Training Hewie is a cool mechanic, although perhaps not the most entertaining one.  I thought it was awesome when I realized that Hewie was performing actions more reliably the more I congratulated him on correct actions and scolded him on failed ones.
 - The overall feel, cutscenes, characters, mystery and set design are extraordinary.  Both spooky and beautiful, I loved exploring this castle.
 - Excellent backtracking in the game allows the chase sequences to player out better as well as appropriately adjusting the game's pacing.  Every time I felt that I had hit a point where I wished for a shortcut back to old areas I was rewarded with one.  Excellent level design.

Quick Cons:
 - Being chased can be incredibly frustrating and awkward, with Debilitas being able to find the player easily despite having a good lead on him, and the fact that he can move much faster than the player can.
 - Most of the puzzles are extremely easy, and the game relies mostly on hunting for a specific item to unlock a specific door along with backtracking.
 - The game has sub-par direction.  Once the player opens a few doors allowing lots of backtracking, the game doesn't directly guide the player at any point during the gameplay.  This can be extremely confusing when the next place the player must check is a specific room that has been visited, and cleared, previously.
 - Hewie's companion mechanic, where he chooses to disobey the player unless significant time has been invested into befriending him, can be extremely frustrating while trying to escape chase sequences of getting Hewie to follow / fetch.",A Simple Review for the Undecided,1474934400,,,

I checked out the controls to make sure they made it safe. No..my navigation control has something broken, rattling loose inside. Its affecting my gameplay. The motion control won't calibrate right. The crosshairs are always pointing to the right and i have the Sharpshooter so its not a issue with how im aiming or anything on my part. Now LBP i have no issues with, great game. Its when i started playing Killzone 3 that i noticed, ""man, this is quite difficult."" In order to look right and left you have to point you crosshairs all the way toward the desired direction. This is no good when you have multiple enemies unloading on you. Its almost impossible to use Move even on Trooper difficulty. (Normal difficulty) on top if this i had to keep calibrating my control, moving the eye, and switching hands to get a better experience. Calibrating this control is a joke. They have you hold your motion control and spin it in 6 different directions until it ends up in the original upright position you start in. ?? Then you start a game and it asks you to calibrate again by pointing at the eye and pressing the move button. But depending on how your standing and where you point from you end up with a feeling that you didn't do it right. Especially when you hold the control where comfortable and yet Sackboys head is looking toward the ceiling or floor. Its so confusing and im usually good with this type of thing. I tried this out on almost all types of games that are move compatible. From LBP, NfS Most Wanted, Bioshock Infinite, and Killzone. In every game, easy mode seemed like hard mode.

I will admit when I originally picked up this game I was skeptical of how fun it would be.  Described as a 'puzzle/action game' it looked a bit basic in terms of skill level and complexity.  I also worried that it would be something more enteraining for families with young children than twentysomethings.  Happily this game proved me wrong and not only have my boyfriend and I gone through almost all the game play available, his mother also loved it so much she got her own copy.

There are many positives about the game.  The first is that it is addictively fun.  We have played it with many different crowds and have yet to find someone who doesn't enjoy the game.  Most are skeptical at first, but then addicted.  It is an especially good game for newbies to the Wii because the game play is very easy to master and intuitive.  Because of this less time is spent mastering the remote and more on enjoying the game.  It also takes full advantage of the movement and possibilities of the Wii remote so it feels very different than playing a game on another system.

I also appreciated the variety of activities between a single game.  Even though they are all different adapations of Jenga like games they are different enough to keep me entertained for hours.  Each game felt different enough that even when I had made it through most of the levels the subsequent ones never felt repetitive or boring.  There is even an in-game editor so you can build levels on your own, leading to seemingly endless gameplay.

Even though I can usually find some flaw with every video game I've purchased this was not the case with this game.  If anything, I'm wishing it came with more levels so I could play longer.

Overall this is a great game that I would recommend whether you are into single or multiplayer gameplay.

Even so, they both had the same issue of the audio cutting out periodically when the cords are moving around, such as if you're wearing them while walking around, as people tend to do with headphones. I'm pretty sure the issue is how they're built and how they're stored in packaging. The cords are super-thin and easily breakable. The cords are then folded at many hard angles inside of the packaging, doubtlessly wearing down the copper wiring inside over the years, meaning that there probably isn't an unopened one of these anywhere that is fully functional. Not to mention they could break pretty easily from getting caught on something or just over time.
It's a shame, because they are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. The spring-loaded ear clip holds firm, yet gentle, like a good husband. They come with a built-in microphone, meaning they work for phones. I've seen that Sony still makes (or recently made) headphones identical to these, but they didn't have a microphone. The microphone is the most important part! That and the comfort. Most phone headsets are ear buds, which are crab. Or worse, ear clips that are also ear buds. What is even the point of that?

So I just decided to wait on the wii u version and get the 3ds one.  The movements on the 3ds version were a lot smoother than previous sonic games which were often very stiff IMO.  That along with his new moves, running up walls and the return of the spin dash made the gameplay seamless and complete.  Many of the levels on the 3ds were like mazes giving you a lot of options for exploration which was great unless your searching for red star rings.  The 3D levels were the best I've played on a sonic game ever something you just have to experience yourself.  The 2D levels were good with sonic but seemed to be designed for super sonic.  It has an online multiplayer race which can be very competitive and fun.  Every level in multiplayer can be mastered making the levels fast paced and fluid.  The overall game was actually very fast paced at times not much slower than previous sonic games IMO.

So some people suggest that the 3ds version is the better version.  I found them both to be unique.  The wii u version was definitely slower paced and more deliberate overall but just as rewarding.  The wii u version seems more like a game you would play after a long day at school or work just to relax.  Although there were several paths you can take for each stage like in previous games they were not mazes like on the 3ds.  I often used the spin dash on the 3ds where as on the wii u it's something that was more optional or for intermediate players.  The graphics were good and often had me going ""Ooooh shiny"".  I found the cutscenes to be boring on the wii u than on the 3ds, often just skipped.

Overall I'm very satisfied with both versions and would say that this is the best sonic game since the genesis era.  They finally got it right.

First of all glitches. I had to reload so many times. Connor is a moron. Carrying two of the same handgun is impossible due to glitches with certain pistols spawning in your holsters every loading point. I had desyncronize all the time to restart missions due to fialing misson ques.

Firearm fails. Okay, so the most powerful pistol would be the Italian flint lock, barrel length is the leading factor in high muzzle velocity, not name or exterior decor. The flintlock musket would outrange all the pistols by double the distance. Less maybe the italian flintlock. Double barrel pistols have two hammers on either side. Not one that magically recocks and re primes itself. The duckfoot was correct. I tend to have a field day in video games with firearm fails.

Conner sucks, a lot. At first I liked Conner, native American badass, son of a Templar. But as the story progressed, I hated him. I wish haythem killed Connor, I liked haythem. He should have had a change in heart or something. Then I would have been happy. Conner is a immature, lacks assassin values and seemed more like a robot than a man. I disagreed with a lot of his decisions. He reminded me of terminator. No heart in anything he did. Ezio was amazing. He was funny and heroic, I always loved it when he won! He was the boss.

Desmond was annoying and fail. I would had been happy if they allowed more free roaming of new York in modern times. Also, the roaming of the wilderness outside of that end of the world tomb. It all felt boxed and too pre determined. All you do is walk into cut scenes.

I liked hunting, that was fun. I wish the bow was more detailed. Custom arrow heads would have been nice. Like a rope arrow, poisen arrows, flaming arrows and armor piercing would have been cool. Also maybe customizable projectiles for guns. assassins should be at a higher technology base than the average citizen.

5.0,True,"07 22, 2010",ABVWBJZKBFIIV,B003M2T8IS,N. Peterson,"Summer's here and there is a lack of FPS games.  At first I was hesitant to purchase Singularity, but I'm glad I did!

The gameplay is your standard FPS fare, nothing new or boundary pushing in Singularity.  The story is interesting, I like the sci-fi elements.  There are too many ""war"" FPS games out there so Singularity fills the void nicely.

Over the course of the game, you receive a Time Manipulation Device, or TMD.  As you play, your TMD is upgraded with powers such as slowing down time, reverting enemies into creatures that go on a rampage, picking up and throwing objects around the environment, and using TMD power as a thruster to knock back and harm enemies and objects.

I like the variety of enemies in this game.  You have Russian troops coming after you as well as different types of mutated humans as a result of the explosion and E99.  Enemies use a variety of weapons and the mutants can throw exploding barrels at you.

The graphics in the game are average, similar to the ""war"" type FPS games where objects and textures appear somewhat blurry/pixelated when you stand next to them.  It's nothing serious and it didn't affect my enjoyment of the game at all.

There are a number of different weapons, your standard rifle and shotgun, pistol, grenade launcher (with a remote controlled rolling bomb secondary attack), sniper rifle, and more, I don't want to give away everything.  Each weapon's clip capacity, reload speed, and damage can be upgraded twice using weapon kits you find in various places around the levels.  First level upgrades require one kit, 2nd require 2.

Scattered everywhere in the game is E99, an element used in everything in this alternate reality.  You collect various containers of it and it's used as a currency to purchase different upgrades such as carrying more health packs, using health faster, longer sprint, more oxygen for swimming, extra weapon precision, and what not.  These different upgrades must be found on blueprints around the levels.  They are generally easy to spot but there are a few that you may pass by.

Overall Singularity is an extremely underrated game.  I'm sad that it hasn't sold more copies because Raven is a good developer.  I thought that by sharing my opinions of the game, I can sway people to check it out.  I've put about 8 hours into the game and I'm not finished yet.  I still have another chapter and a half or so.

You search the planet to regain strength and repair your ship. This is how the game starts. From what I understand, you, your ship & the planet you are on is randomly generated and different for each player.

PROS
+ Beautiful world. Colorful, full of plants, caves, creatures. The world is endless. This game will never end!
+ Massive area to explore. I see no end to the vastness of this world.
+ Interesting, upgradable character, weapons & ships.
+ Slowly progressive story-line. Very open.

CONS
- At first, it's quite unclear what exactly to do. But that is the style of the game. You will slowly discover the tools needed to progress.
- Sometimes save points are not often enough. You could spend hours searching and just walking around without a save. You can save when you enter & exit your ship and when you find little save tower things.
- The idea of the game is simple. Due to this it can get repetitive.

The graphics are decent, they were going more for style than wow factor. The control is solid and over-all the joy of the game is to simply enjoy exploring at your own pace. This game is massively huge and will take you forever to complete, if there ever actually is a foreseeable closure to the game.

The save feature is the only downfall to this game. I see myself simply putting my PS4 into suspend mode to basically pause the game. However as the game does have many online features, I may get kicked out. Time will tell. I have kids and work, so I cannot dedicate hours upon hours to play non-stop. This save feature may cause issues and may deter me from even playing as I know I could potentially play for an hour then end up losing everything I just did if I cannot locate a save point or get back to my ship quick enough.

Time will tell how the game evolves as I play, but over-all I'm really enjoying. It is very relaxing at times as the score is naturally peaceful and the visuals are fun & stylistic.

Then it seems like you are doing the same thing over and over.

4.0,False,"10 25, 2009",A2KJ2HDGNV0OIO,B001TOMQVC,SBK479,"This on-rails shooter serves as an immediate prequel to EA's critically-acclaimed 2008 release Dead Space, which put the player into the magnetic boots of deep-space engineer Isaac Clarke, whose routine repair mission to the planet-cracker vessel U.S.G. Ishimura turned out to be anything but routine.

In Dead Space extraction, the player assumes control of several different characters from the colony on Aegis VII, starting with the removal of the infamous Marker, which caused all the undead mayhem to begin with. Within minutes, most of the colony has begun to experience homicidal delusions, mutations, and an inexplicable urge to grow giant talons and rip former mates apart. The game follows a group of four survivors who attempt to find safe refuge aboard the Ishimura, which as we all know was an epic fail.

Graphics: $9

Considering that this is the Wii, they did a decent job of re-creating the colony and the ship, almost as if the used the same ""blueprints"" from the original game. You get to visit lots of familiar locales from the original game, but from a decidedly-different perspective (""Wait, there's not supposed to be a wall there...Oh.""), as well as lots of new places. Visuals are a decent port from the PS3/360 versions.

Sound: $10

Good voice acting, especially from one of the familiar characters from the first game. I love the Alien-inspired orchestral score and the eerily-silent vacuum of space.

Gameplay/Controls: $7

Controls are good and responsive, and act within the same ""always vulnerable"" context as the first game (i.e., no pausing the game to access inventory, etc.). Auto-fire is my only beef for the controls, as turning the remote 90 degrees for the plasma cutter is not as easy as it sounds in the middle of a heavy fight.

Regarding gameplay itself, I have never been a huge fan of on-rails shooters, with the exception of a few like Space Gun, Steel Gunner and T2 (yes, a licensed game that wasn't total crap). This is because if you can't pick something up at a specific moment (due to your being, you know, mauled by a slasher at said moment), you cannot TURN AROUND and go back to get it. I can't tell you how many times I yelled at the TV to turn the... heck around to go back and get some badly-needed ammo, or to get in the... stinking airlock. But they at least give some limited freedom of movement and the ability to grab things via kinesis, which at least mitigates the problem.

There were also a few clipping issues during a few boss battles (and yes, I was aiming for the limbs). That, and the camera can sometimes give you motion sickness.

Genre: $7

Like the original game, this one is a hodge-podge of borrowed ideas. Music from Alien/Aliens. Combat system similar to Resident Evil. Improvised weapons a-la Army of Darkness. The first-person perspective of this game is used very successfully in creating a sense of isolation, loneliness and, of course, mortal terror of an impending evisceration. Strategic dismemberment works in a shooter, too.

They also do a great job of filling in all the backstory, and take you by surprise several times. The ending actually tops the one from the original game.

Fun: $8.50

The above-mentioned issues notwithstanding, the campaign still manages to provide lots of frights and satisfying kills. Not concerned about a One-Gun achievement, I was able to become better acquainted with the Ripper and Force Gun. Cackling ensued.

Replay/Value: $6

So, now I'm done with it. I could go back and re-do it for more achievements and unlockables, but... I just ate, and I don't really want to. The campaign was relatively short but satisfying.

Bottom Line: $47.50 out of $60 ($40 out of $50 for the Wii)

Again, not a full-price game, but lots of fun the first time through. If I could go back and re-grade the original Dead Space, I would give both games 4 stars. The original definitely has the edge in replay and technical attributes, this one has it on atmosphere and combat.

I await Dead Space 2 with great excitement.","Fun, with the help of a little dramamine...",1256428800,5,,

In Electroplankton, there are ten different electroplanktons to toy with, all of which create nice, experiemental sounds that are vaguely musical. It's fun for about thirty minutes (not to mention breathtaking) but you'll turn it off with little reason to turn it back on again. When you do, it'll be for five to ten minutes tops, each time.

You won't have a problem with this. It's a program that's designed for minor play, as there's really not much to do.

Fortunately, it sounds amazing and looks really beautiful. Everything is 2D (of course) but it's done in such an artsy, colorful way. It's definitely something for both your eyes and ears.

There will be moments when you'll get a happy accident. Many moments. And every time, you'll wish you had a way to save it on the cartridge. And you simply can't. (Sure, you can save it via output to a computer or a tape/mp3 player, but this seems a bit unnecessary, as the average video gamer probably doesn't have said equipment. Not to mention that something would be ""lost"" without the visuals).

It's an open-ended experience, and while it's an interesting idea, something inside of me wishes there were simply *more* of it. Specifically, more electroplankton. After playing through all ten, you'll quickly get an understanding of which three or so are your favorite, and the couple that you don't like will probably never be played again. Twenty electroplankton would have been excellent.

But, it is what it is: art. It's futile to attach some ultimate score for something like this; art is subjective, therefore someone can think Electroplankton is absolutely brilliant and someone can think it's absolutely not. I happen to fall somewhere inbetween. It's good, but not good enough for the price.

Finally able to get one for myself, I received mine yesterday. The gaming mouse looks, and feels, very much like my Deathadder Chroma. The RGB lighting is gorgeous, and the overall performance is amazing.

PROS:
1) The Gaming Performance
= The Mamba TE performs very well during my gaming sessions. I experienced no tracking issues whatsoever and the grip and texture of the mouse makes it very comfortable for long term use.

2) The Comfort
= The gaming mouse is one of the most comfortable mouse I have ever used for gaming (and also for general use), apart from the Deathadder Chroma. The top surface texture is very nice to to the touch, and the side grips improves the overall comfort of the mouse.

3) RGB Lighting
= One of the most prominent features of the Razer Mamba TE is the RGB lighting. I have to say, the lighting is simply amazing. It is both bright and colorful, and I can easily customize and configure the lighting settings through the Synapse software. My favorite would have to be the wave effect, as it makes the mouse looks absolutely stunning.

4) The Build Quality
= The mouse has a very premium feel to it, and the build quality is great. It is pretty lightweight and sturdy.

CONS
1) Response Issues
= Sometimes the scroll wheel will bug out and will be unresponsive. When I first started using it, the left click does not register at all. However, all the performance issues are settled whenever I updated the firmware of the mouse through Synapse. No more issues afterwards.

In conclusion, the Razer Mamba TE is one of the best gaming mouse in the market, along with the Deathadder Chroma. Personally for me, the Deathadder Chroma is ever-so-slightly more comfortable than the Mamba TE. Performance-wise, they are very close to each other, both being extremely responsive.

The lessons found in the game are numerous, but they never go into enough depth to adequately teach anything in particular; in a Japanese course textbook, an entire page or so would be dedicated to these concepts with various example sentences demonstrating different usages and workbook assignments would test the student's ability to use the grammar in a practical way.  In this game, the general approach is to say ""ga means 'but,' desu means 'is'"" and then move on.  There are only occasionally example sentences, and only for one or two of the ten words in a given lesson.

The games used to practice are also very questionable, with some of them being clever memorization aids while others are fairly useless wastes of time.  The most straightforward games are usually the best- flash cards, multiple choice, and character tracing/writing are all helpful in memorizing new material, but these games generally just focus on single words or characters and don't teach you much about using them in the context of full sentences.  Many of the games that do present the player with full sentences to fill in generally waste their potential by using romaji instead of kana, something no decent textbook would force students to do aside from maybe the first lesson.

The biggest problem with the game is that it's riddled with errors in its stroke orders, which unfortunately undermines the greatest appeal of having a touch-screen based Japanese guide.  Many of the hiragana, katakana, and kanji are taught incorrectly and often times the player is forced to write them the wrong way in order to proceed.  This is an annoyance to those who already know how to write the correct way, but it's genuinely problematic for those who are learning the characters for the first time, as they're likely to develop a habitual way of writing that may be hard to break in the future.  When the characters are correct, the tracing games are actually a great asset and may be the very best thinkable way to practice writing in Japanese, but the mistakes made by the developer render this moot.

Overall, My Japanese Coach is an entertaining way to pass some time and reinforce one's studying of the language, but it can only really be a helpful aid if one is already studying in a more in-depth manner.  Without a solid basis to work from, the lessons in this game will make little sense and the player will reach the end of the game feeling as if they haven't really learned much of anything aside from random, rarely usable vocabulary.  Alongside an actual course program and a textbook like Genki, the game's value grows dramatically as the player will then be able to understand the lessons more clearly.

I really was just expecting to see Crysis all over again, but Warhead really has a lot of realism that I've not experienced so enjoyably in other games.  The game is more fluid... none of the ""you can't jump on top of that rock eventhough it's only 2 feet high"" limitations.

The graphics are the most realistic I've seen, but still needs a little system adjustment.  Running two 9800's and still have to run at slightly lower settings with DX10.  There is a way to force DX9, but overall the graphics are killer.

This game has many surprises in it that serve to make you feel like you are in another part of the world, but not a fake one.

4.0,False,"11 27, 2008",AWAGSXM9CNZCC,B0014CFO4K,An Android Fan,"Gears of War 2 simply is a game that must be played by any 360 owner who enjoys shooters of any flavor. Whether you love the over-the-top craziness that is Halo or if Rainbow 6 is more to your liking, there is much to be found here in Gears 2. While keeping the gameplay that every Gears fan knows and loves intact, Epic has managed to improve on the things that needed improvement, wiped out almost all of what pulled the first game down, added lots of new features that only add to the experience while literally take nothing away, nothing, and managed to expand upon the admittedly fairly simple characters.

Seeing as how the letdowns are very minor, I'll just get those out of the way now.

1. It's still easy to hit cover you don't want to hit, although this is much improved. I went from constantly hitting cover I didn't want in almost every single round to doing it maybe once or twice a match, and saying it happens four or more times per match is being absurdly ridiculous.

2. The ""three downs and you're out"" rule is still in effect in Execution, even there is NO mention of it anywhere in the tutorials or the game description - the game just tells you to get a one-shot kill or an in-close ""execution"" on the enemy.

3. The single player gives the player a ""crutch"" on Casual - if you fall in Solo, you can be helped up, but no such luck on harder modes, if you fall, you die. I can understand Epic wanting to ease the player in but that is already very easily accomplished with the bucket loads of ammo and the limited damage an enemy does. Having this put in only to take it away on a harder mode is needless.

4. The Multiplayer bots are STUPID. I actually had a match where it was down to one enemy and I had all four of my bots alive, yet their idiocy led to the one killing off all four of them one at a time. And sometimes the last enemy will be down but they won't rush in to finish them even if the clock is on its last 10 seconds. They're not completely worthless but they're not completely reliable either.

5. If a friend is down next to a weapon, for some reason the game will force you to pick up the weapon first, then help up your friend.

6. The Endor, I mean, Reaver level could've been better, or just scratched and used as a cutscene. Hopefully Gears 3 will be without this.

7. For reasons I cannot even begin to comprehend, Epic forces the player to have a completely different weapons setup for the fight with Skorge. And they don't give you your original layout after that and the following section are finished.

Update: The many glitches that brought the gameplay in multiplayer down have been destroyed. For details, search ""Gears 2 Glitches Fixed"" without the quotes.

However, all of these gripes even put together do not in any way shape or form diminish the game at all. AT ALL. Suffice it to say that Epic has smashed all expectations, and given how high they were, that is saying something. The new Gears, despite the cynical, self-righteous jaded players insist, is NOT just the same game with a ""2"" behind it. As they were supposed to do, Epic has added much, such as chainsaw dueling, mobile cover, new multiplayer modes, new maps, (some of which have new hazards to look out for) new weapons, the heavy machine guns can overheat now, and while this isn't saying much, the storyline delves into the characters, especially Dom, a little bit more deeply, emphasis on the ""little bit."" We're only given a hint of Dom searching for his wife in the first game, and that story line comes to the fore later in this game, although it does NOT take anything away from the overall conflict. The plot twist towards the end probably could've had a little more of a punch to it but it's not terrible in any way, and the ending will leave the gamer to wonder what will happen now, especially if they're patient enough to wait out the credits.

The chainsaw duels are simple - Just tap B! but there's tension that you feel leading up to the outcome, which makes winning it feel really good. An enemy can interfere, but that's what teammates are for.

Speaking of teammates, rely on them. Use them to help you. Communicate. Stick to cover and help your buddies out. Teamwork, communication and cover are key. Fail to use one and you'll probably lose. Fail to use two and you will lose. Don't use any of them and you've already lost before the match has even started. Now that being shot slows you down, gone is the chance to rush in shotguns blazing and Rambo your team to victory. Try that in Gears 2 and your only reward is to watch the entire match through spectator camera, which is much improved by the way. Now you have to see to it that concrete, not air, is between you and the bullets if you want to have a chance at winning the match. So stick with your teammates. You win as a team, you lose as a team.

Mobile cover makes its debut and is a smashing addition. In Gears 1, there was only about one way to get mobile cover - be in front of someone who's taking the bullets. Now there is a heavy shield and the chance to take hostage enemies that are downed. Either one will work, although the latter will deteriorate as it soaks up damage and slows you down. The shield will prevent you from mantling and rolling but running is still there. Given just how important cover is in this game, being able to move around with it is good.

I won't delve much into the new modes as the game does a great job of walking the player through how each mode works. Guardian is a great twist on the VIP type of match, even better than Assassination. Submission is a great twist on Capture the Flag, Wingman is very chaotic, perhaps about as chaotic as Gears gets, given the number of small teams, King of the Hill hasn't changed the formula but why fix it if its not broken and Horde is a lot of fun, especially with people who will work together to keep everyone alive. Execution, Warzone and Annex are still the same.

The maps are easy to memorize and suit both sides well. Neither side has a positional advantage regardless of which spawn point they begin the map on. Most are symmetrical and all are small so players will always have plenty of action quickly on in a round and investigating a map to flush out the final enemy doesn't take too long. The maps called Avalanche, Security and Hail have environmental hazards that are just as deadly as an enemy, so a novice would do well to find out how to avoid these so as to not die needlessly.

The Flamethrower, Ink Grenades, an automatic pistol, a mobile heavy machine gun, mortar and the aforementioned shield help round out Gear's already robust weapon roster and any of these can be removed or changed if a player doesn't like them. The Ink Grenades are basically poison, throw or set it and an enemy (or friend!) will continually take damage as they remain in the affected area. Smoke grenades now stun an enemy. As said before, heavy machine guns will overheat, so while mounted ones have unlimited ammo, this helps balance them out. The mobile variant, however, still has a limit, but again, you can move around. Slowly. Speaking of moving around, another MUCH APPRECIATED feature is the ability to crawl when the enemy has downed you in multiplayer. In the first game, if you were downed, you had to stay in place and hope someone would come get you before the enemy finished the job. Now you can close some of the distance between yourself and a teammate, which can mean the difference between winning and losing a match.

And thankfully the sniper rifle's active reload does NOT automatically down someone in Gears 2. Epic got smart and decided to make it so that if your character has full health, an active will damage your character enough so that one more hit will down you. Why on earth they didn't do it this way in the first place is beyond me, but THANK YOU Epic for fixing this needlessly frustrating gameplay element. There are few things more annoying than being killed by a sniper who doesn't have the skill to properly use their weapon. It takes no skill whatsoever to down someone this way. In the first game, all you'd have to do is get another active and down the enemy two more times to kill them, since after getting up the player has to wait a moment before moving (again Epic, WHY DID YOU DO THIS?) So again, Epic, thank you for not allowing such a cheap and frustrating gameplay element poison a great multiplayer experience two games in a row.

Well, I think that about covers it....Oh wait, that's right, the story. Epic still isn't getting high marks for a stellar storyline, but let's face it - the game is about war and the characters have bodies that steroid users can only wish for. Marcus is still the gruff meat head who sounds like gravel is grinding in his throat, Dom is his more level-headed friend who wants to find his wife, Cole is still the hilarious but excellent soldier and Baird is still the whiny sarcastic jerk who will remind everyone that he's the only one who knows how to fix things. Adding onto the roster is Tai, a spiritual warrior who prays as well as he shoots, Benjamin Carmine, Anthony Carmine's (from the first game) brother and Dizzy, who quickly shows just how one-dimensional his character is in about the first five minutes you meet him but is still funny enough to deserve to be in the next game. With the exception of Dom, none of the characters really grow or change throughout the second game, but then again, this is Gears we're talking about. In these games storyline simply does take a backseat to the gameplay, and the gameplay is solid.

And parents, DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT let the Mature rating prevent you from letting your child at least rent the game, because in another stroke of genius, Epic has given you the ability to filter out the language and/or gore.

All in all Gears 2 is a great game and I would strongly recommend it. There is much to be found and loved by the whole gaming community. If you haven't played the first Gears yet, there's little reason to bother getting it first, as Wikipedia can fill the player in on the storyline.

These warriors obtain these gems that allow them to transform into armored warriors and slightly change the course of battle.

The game features some nice cutscenes, nice graphics, SOME interesting characters, and an interesting plot only brought down by some uninspired or drab locales, a somewhat predictable or cliched set of events, and a few annoying voice overs.

Graphics- 7/10

Prerendered backgrounds that are quite lovely. Beautiful and action packed FMV sequences that are definitely worth watching. Transformations that are eye catching. Some of the character models are a little blocky; however, they animate quite well in and out of battle. They animate with such fluidity fit the game quite well.

Sound- 7/10

The music wasn't exactly epic, but it worked. Some of the music was a little monotonous; but it was suiting.

Sound effects were quite pleasant. Earlier in the game, you could hear the rushing of the water. Every action had a suiting sound effect.

The voices were both good and bad. The voices of the characters fit them perfectly, but some of the voice acting didn't quite fit with some of the actions of some of the characters; they were good for the most part though.

Story- 8/10

The story was quite enjoyable and unique. The story didn't drag too much and kept its pace. The one thing I can say is that the story itself didn't deviate too much...or at least the events that occurred during the story. Everything just falls into place nicely. The fact that the game revolved around warriors able to harness the power of ""dragoon armor"" was pretty cool.

Gameplay- 7/10

The gameplay is typical RPG fare. It seems the two ways to determine gameplay lies within how exploration takes place and how battles are played. Exploration takes place as most of the RPGs do; the battle is turn-based. Fighters can time their attacks (using X) to do a combo attack that can take more damage than just initiating an attack.

You can also transform into dragoons during battle which actually add to the strategy of battles. There is a basic attack that requires you to time your button presses which (like the character chain/combo attacks) can deal more damage the more times you press the attack button at the right time.

I recommend this game to anyone who's looking to play an RPG that is a little different in terms of characters and abilities. The Sailor Moon-esque element this game has definitely makes it different from a lot of the other RPGs out there. It isn't quite the ""Final Fantasy VII"" that the back of the box (or perhaps reviews) made it sound to be, but it is quite good and worth the try.",Quite an Adventure...,1197676800,,,

5.0,False,"11 13, 2009",AMN8IO2QVW5AY,B001IK1BWC,Patrick Mcnelis,"BioWare certainly did out-do themselves with this game.  I have been a BioWare fan since the original Baldur's Gate, and this game continues their reign as king of the computer role playing game genre.

One of the greatest elments of this game is the world BioWare created for it.  There are all sorts of monsters and dragons, but it is in the area of protagonists where the world, while resembling traditional fantasy RPG, is completely new.

There are dwarves, elves and humans, but their backstory is not like that of fantasy RPG games past.  In this world, dwarves are not drunken Scots, but scheming politicos isolated in a society controlled by an oppressive caste system.  Dwarves are more likely to stab you in the back than club you in the face in this game.

Elves are the underclass in this game.  Whatever they were in ancient times, today they are not the pompous immortals, but servants and whipping boys.  Being smallish, they are easily enthralled by the human populace who use them as house servants and employ them in menial and laborious tasks.  No longer educated and enlightened, they are easily taken advantage of.

The humans are not the same dundering sods who have screwed up the planet time and again, but the one element actually trying to hold it all together, despite the retreat of the dwarves into the underworld and the elves into servitude.  Not as devious as the dwarves, but humans are arguably more intelligent, and more physically capable than the elves; the humans dominate the world's surface.

One of the most interesting twists on the standard fantasy world fodder in the application of the mage class.  The mage is not the elder intellectual being spouting volumes of wisdom at every turn.  In this game mages are to be despised.  They are truly powerful beings, and not ""balanced"" as in some other games out there.  But their power has made them dangerous.  They have become channels for the demons who seek to destroy the world.  So the mages are essentially imprisoned by the church and kept under constant supervision by the Templars to ensure they do not turn.

Gone, too, is the multi-theism found in most fantasy worlds.  In this game there is only one god, and all sentient creatures follow it.

Mechanixcally, I found the game tobe of the highest caliber.  The animations and the visuals in general are extremely well done.  Considering that that game has been in development for some 4 years, that its graphics still hold up to the latest is a testament to the skills of the BioWare team.  Admittedly, the game is not as graphically stunning as, say, Fallout 3 or Oblivion, but the difference is neglible at worst.  And this game trumps either of those Bethesda titles in the vastness and intricacies of the story behind the gameplay.  In Oblivion and Fallut 3 you can wander to anywhere you can see on the screen, but the storyline is fairly sparse and the interconnectivity of the quest system is minor and very scripted.  In Dragon Age, gameplay is story-driven, and that story is incredibly well written and incredibly well voiced by the actors.

If you are a Role Playing Game aficionado, this game is a must-have for your PC game collection.  It has more than earned it's place next to such favorites as Baldur's Gate II, Diablo and the Elder Scrolls series.  Action gamers and FPS'ers may have a difficult time getting into this game because of the pace and the dialogue, but this game was obviously not written to be a hybrid.  It is unashamedly a masterful RPG.

Shantae features colors, animation, and scrolling backgrounds that must push the aging GBC to it's absolute limits.  The game is  so advanced that it puts many GBA games to shame!  But it's not just the technology that makes Shantae so stunning.
The play is multi-layred with over 50 locations to explore, many secrets to be discovered, money to be collected for buying fighting gear, and 3 mini-games.  Shantae (a magical half-genie), can also learn dances that change her form.  My favorite is the monkey, which lets you jump higher and climb walls.  As you play, day turns to night and back again.  It's a neat effect pulled off brilliantly in the graphics, but what makes it truly great is that it's not just for show.  You actually need to expolre areas at night to gain certain power ups and even to gain access to a hidden level.  That level can only be found if you play Shantae on the GBA.  That's right, Way Foraward has included a hidden level for the GBA only!
I was also really impressed with the integration of the story.  This is not a game where you read the booklet to know what's going on and what your motivation for playing is.  As you play the game, scenes take place that will progress the story.  Explaining why things are happening, who people are and where you need to go.
The only complaint I have is that the world is so huge,  the levels so labyrinthine that I can't believe a map mode wasn't included.  So I get lost often, but my wondering has helped me find a few hidden secrets.  So it's it's ot all that bad.

This game is a little different 2 than the previous 2 games since there are multiple hidden paths you can take, and depending upon how you select your path determines the outcome of the game itself, it was a smart addition and added some level of detail for the game. Anyways, the game play in this SOR game might be some of the best, the controls are really well laid out, and are responsive. Each character has their own combination of attacks and speical moves, and also each character has a variety of speical attacks that can be utilized with different weapons gathered through out the game. Another very different aspect of this SOR3 is the music, its very high tempo and has some rather odd time signatures, particularly on the song cycle, and fuze. Then there are tracks that sound like nothing but classic SOR music such as the song Moon, and Poets. The graphics are great, and are the best in the series, particularly when or if you get the 1 of the final levels, the ending shows off the power of the Genesis 16-bit console. Another thing I will say is that the diffuclty in this game is also pretty high, this has got 2 be also the hardest of the SOR games. Play this game on the HARD mode and you will see what I am talking about. Lenght wise, I think its perfect, some people might find it a little long, but I think its perfect in that regards.

This game has fantastic graphics.  They are bright and colorful and just plain well done.  If you're like me and used to seeing Wii sports and the various Mario games, this is going to knock your socks off.

Skylanders is also complicated enough to keep kids entertained.  By which I mean if you have a child like mine -- he's currently 9 -- who has previously set to memory hundreds of Pokemon and Kirby facts, then Skylanders has powers and hats and soul gems and characters to learn about.

There's online play that coordinates with the game.  Like some stuffed animals and dolls, you can get character codes which unlock online play that features mini-games.

The game has only mild violence.  On par, I would say, with Mario jumping on the mushroom folk.

The game has clues, particularly on the beginning levels.  My son plays with our next door neighbor who is only 6 years old, and he does alright.

The Skylander toys are quite detailed and can be played with separately.

The toys can also be taken to someone else's house and used with a different portal AND they 'remember' their previous adventures.  There's also a feature to 'nickname' them.  My son named his Spiro, ""David, Jr.""

BAD NEWS
This bad news can also be good news.  The game is a money suck.  There are 32 characters that it is possible to collect, and kids are going to want them because they play differently, and certain types are the only ones that can cross certain barriers.  Money-wise, this isn't good.  BUT, if you have a child that enjoys this game, then you know what you and/or Great Aunt Ruth can get for the next birthday.

The other bit of bad news is that it's possible to race through Skylanders to the end.  When I asked my son how he did this, he answered that he did it by going back to the first level and then leveling up.  Which hasn't dampened his enthusiasm, by the way.  When I ask him about that, he said that he replays levels because 'battle mode' is fun, and because the treasures are very difficult to find.

For those who don't know, Halo Wars is an RTS (Real-Time Strategy) game where you control multiple units from a third-person perspective. You can create bases, build units, move them, and fight with them! The controls are very easy to learn with the tutorials. I highly recommend playing both tutorials (Regular & Advanced) before you play campaign or skirmish. THIS IS A NO SPOILER REVIEW!!!

Campaign:

This is a very fun and enjoyable campaign! I haven't done the entire thing yet, but I am almost done. The story is great, and it is easy to know what your objective is. Aside from the requirements for the mission in general, there are fairly easy side objectives that can be completed in the mission. There are 15 missions in the campaign, each taking approximately 15-20 minutes each. I had trouble with 2 of the missions, but I looked up online a good strategy. There is a co-op mode for the campaign, which makes hard missions a lot easier (especially if that friend is very good at the game). So overall, the campaign is very fun.

Skirmish:

Skirmish is a mode where you can play different game modes with different leaders from the UNSC and the Covenant. You can do 1-1, 2-2, and 3-3 games. You can either play by yourself or with your friends against AI enemies. There are 3 UNSC leaders and 3 Covenant leaders, each having different abilities and unique units. With the UNSC, your leader is NOT a general unit. With the Covenant, you can fight with and control your leader. There are tons of maps to choose from! There are 2 DLC packs, but I don't think they're worth buying. They just add a few extra maps. So overall, the skirmish mode is very fun.

Multiplayer:

Multiplayer is also very fun. You can do the same modes as Skirmish, but just on Xbox LIVE.I generally like the 1-1 matches better because if you're doing 2-2 or 3-3, if one player drops out on your team, it greatly decreases your chance for success. There is a rank-up system in Multiplayer as well. The only problem is that only about 5,000 people play multiplayer, so it's really hard to find a match unless you have lots of friends. So I haven't played multiplayer as much.

Overall:

Halo Wars is a great RTS that is fun to play and easy to learn how to play. All of the modes are very fun, but I prefer Skirmish over any other.

Having been a Sonic fan all my life, I've seen my fair share of games come and go, and recently (past 10 years recently) have been incredibly disappointed with what I've seen.

Sonic Adventure was, in my opinion, the last ""good"" sonic game. One that was genuinely fun to play. It was likely a lot of Sonic fans saw this as fun as it was the first true departure from the side-scrolling platformer and into the 3D world, but it worked, despite some camera-issues and glitches here and there. Simply, it was fun, and that's all you really want to expect out of a Sonic game.

And that's why I love Sonic Generations. Its simply fun. Its less gimmicky than some recent games, and takes you back to a time when Sonic games were all about straight-forward fun, with quirky, straight-forward and entertaining level design.

Like the older games, the levels in Sonic Generations DO get harder the further you progress. Not impossible, but just harder. Many of the recent Sonic games just haven't had that natural progression.

Not only do you get to mimic the moves to the avatar but your able to customize your avatar down to the clothing, facial structure, hair shape and color as well as eyes. Give your avatar a tattoo or eye glasses just select them its that easy.

There are 3 levels of play mode for beginner (this is where I still play), intermediate (for those than can learn the moves quicker), and expert (after you've mastered the moves).

Choosing from songs from today's hot artists and old school you'll certainly find songs you remember from back in the day and songs playing on the radio today that you know and love. Get ready to learn some cool club movies and impress your friends and you'll even learn the names in the Power skooling mode. Breaks down the dance moves for you so you can learn at your pace. Move on to Dance Marathon mode when your ready to ""pop it like its hot"" and dance your way to breakin up a sweat while learning and breaking out the moves that will sure to get your ready for bikini this summer.

The one issue I have with the game is that the avatar hand isn't as response as we'd like it to be but I love that the game has a voice option to make selection easier.

In my experience, they usually have some annoying quirk, ranging from one card that required its own boot disc to the more normal quirk of having a higher rate of data decay than a name-brand memory card. If your data is important, I would put it on a Sony memory card. If you're broke and just need more temporary storage space, you can save a few bucks going off-brand. I have 3 PS2 memory cards, and one is off-brand...and has a corrupt file. I don't even remember what the file used to be, but I can't delete it, so that card is forever a little bit smaller than my other two. I also have a game that literally takes an entire memory card, and isn't worth keeping the save after you beat the game. When I play it, I temporarily move stuff from one of my name-brand cards to my off-brand card. If you need a memory card and can afford this one, get it. Even if you don't care about the quality of the card now, you might regret your decision in a few years.

The wierdest part is that I didn't like GTAIV and I did like the action that started off in SR2. But then is dragged and it dragged hard.

Gameplay
Let me say that the game play is really fun. I did enjoy the fighting mechanics. They are easy and really fit on the PS3 pad. Shooting was a bit of a hit and miss but enjoyable as well. I only wish that they had a auto target system, but it still got the job done. Headshots were interesting to come by. The driving was really fun. It reminded me of GTA San Andreas. The cars are all great and the cop cars are really fast. It helps when you are on chases. Taking over helicopters reminded me a bit of the original Mercenaries. It is easy to do.

Story
This is where things got a little wierd for me. Now I know that most games don't always have you doing righteous things, but I really felt bad playing this game. We have all seen the bad guy that wants revenge thing before so this should be no surprise. But I was a little shocked when your partner guns down what appears to be some 60 year old judge. It just didn't feel right. Also, I didn't like the fact that you can't play the game straight. What I mean is that instead of the open design of GTA, where you could do only story missions or sidequests whenever you choose, this game forces you to do a whole bunch of side quests and mini games before it opens up the next story mission for you to go through. I found that to be extremely frustrating especially when you were getting into the main story and then you have your attention diverted to do sometimes pointless side quests. Being a cop with a film crew like COPS was interesting until your umptenth time of trying to get enough points to move the game forward.

Overall
I would say that there are some great online mechanics in the fact that you can actually take someone with you to help out missions during play. That was fun. But overall, the pacing is what killed me. Breaking up what was an interesting story from time to time just to do meaningless tasks in order to continue was really annoying. Especially when you get to the juicy parts of the game. But if you can stomach that, then there is a chance that you might enjoy the game. I would say that GTA might be a better fit.",Not What I Expected,1276387200,7,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

Through my analysis I learned that the pricing was not consistent between all the codes.  Some came out to be as high as .83 cents real money per MS Point and others .80, and it was not a linear progression based on volume in a single purchase, i.e. it is not cheaper to buy the 1600 over the 800 point code.  I finally determined that the 2400 point codes offered the best return on investment at .80 per MS Point.

In my review I will talk and focus on -ve reviews given to this game. After reading through all the -ve reviews, here as well as other websites, I have come to conclusion that the such reviewers are pretty amateurs or newbies in the video gaming world. The good thing in reviews is that thanks to release of this game on all platforms now PS fans are not trashing XBOX fans and vice versa and the whole focus is on the game it self instead of console wars. Although I would like to hear if GTAIV performed well on XBOX or PS or equal.

The game is very vast and caries the honor of being the pioneer in roam freely & do whatever virtual world concept, i.e. GTAIII. GTAIV does face a challenge that how much free roaming and  flexible this new world is. Definitely GTAIV has provided the best virtual world ever but it sometimes increases the anxiety or enthusiasm  for gamer to expect more than the game can offer. For instance a lot of time while playing I have wished that I could go into that building/shop and see whats inside or I could flirt with a hot girl on the street more. But keep in mind the developers are not God that they can provide 100% virtual world.

This game shows clearly that how fast and keen human being is in developing almost another virtual world within this real world. We have created simulations of almost every process involved around modern human being i.e. virtual Stock Exchange, virtual wheather forecast, Second Life etc.. pretty soon you will see a release of Grand Theft Auto where millions of gamers will be simultaneously playing in only one centrally hosted Liberty City just like second life.

I also don't play online - my comments are just about the single player campaign, and more specifically, playing this game with the Move/Sharpshooter.

After being frustrated by several 'Sharpshooter compatible' games for PS3 that really seemed to treat the Move as an afterthought, I saw this game for cheap and decided to dust off my Sharpshooter and give it one last try.

I think the designers of this game did the best job of trying to make the Sharpshooter a success right 'out of the box'. I especially like the fact that at the default setting, the camera tracking approximates your movement - if you pan the Sharpshooter slowly, the camera moves slow too - not a perfect 1:1 match, but I couldn't get other games to do this no matter how much I fiddled with the optional settings. And speaking of optional settings, SOCOM4 offers a lot of tweakability for the Move, so I may experiment with those as well. There are also in game onscreen button prompts.

Bottom line, with just a little learning curve, SOCOM4 actually gets to be fun with the Sharpshooter pretty quick.

Anyway, I saw the Sharpshooter on clearance for well under $10 at a local big box store, and it's too bad - with more games like SOCOM4, the Move might have had a bigger following.",Worth getting if you have a Sharpshooter,1406246400,,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

The hook here, obviously, is the touch screen. Let me tell you, using a stylus is just as intuitive as using a button interface. Everything is incredibly responsive; I can't think of a single time when I had to tap or rub repeatedly to get the game to react.

There are a respectable number of characters in the game, each with his or her own control mechanic. To complete the game, you must finish a set of each character's ""microgames"" (think minigames, only they last around 5 seconds each). For example, there's a character for ""slicing"", one for ""scribbling"", and another for ""dragging"", among others. This variety keeps the game fresh, and always makes you excited to play as a new person.

The microgames themselves are extremely well-designed. Although you are thrown straight into them, with no explanation or instructions, it's a cinch to figure out your objective and complete it within the time limit. You'll find yourself doing things as diverse as scribbling ketchup onto hot dogs, chopping carrots, or scratching backs. Lots of the games are funny, too. I should also mention that each game has three levels of difficulty, which adds more variety.

Maybe what I like best about this game, beyond the great gameplay, is the extraordinary amount of content. Sure, the ""main"" game can be finished quickly, but there's a boatload of things to do after viewing the credits. By earning high scores, you can earn tons of extra prizes. These prizes are really great and unique; you can unlock everything from a playable piano to a two-player ping-pong game.

This game has convinced me that the DS has real potential. It's a joy to play, it'll keep you entertained for hours, and it's full of little surprises that'll make you smile.

The rpg elements in this game are lovely and fun. this is like a game made out all rpg player expectation. Ok.. i know I'm exaregating some things, but this game is truly beautiful... But to made this review more detailed , I divided the rating in various section:

The story: 9.5/10 , the story is very engaging , The dragon things and village all that stuff are very interesting... this is almost like a story from an Anime.

Sound: 8.0, the music is lovely, most of them are very familiar ( if you ever played zelda ) that is why is not completely original in that way ,but the music is still beautiful. the bad part there is no voice in character only text which is ok for me.

Graphics: 8.5, the ""graphics"" is not that good if you compared it to Ghost of sparta, but the art design is beautiful: the environments and... girls !

Gameplay: 9.3, the gameplay is fun, but a bit repetitive just like KH, sometimes i feel like im only pressing the X button to the extreme! but what diference this to Kh is that this game the dodgin is actually worthy ! the camera is better and the rpg elements are better ! Kh felt most like a hack and slash... this game also give you more exploring just like Zelda.. In fact this game almost like Zelda

Overall: 9.2 , this game is amazing , but i cant give higher score because there is also more thing to consider and this game some flaws but overall is beautiful , just make me feel like im playing Ocarina in a Psp, so just stop reading this and buy this game !

Positives:

1) The game is good to play for a certain time.

2) They manage to have the events close to real and with actual athletes by name and county.

3) The intro to each, the idea or have the words relating to the event is real unique, a 5star for that job.

4) The movement of the athletes are really good. (close to the real thing)

5) The compitision can be real good at parts of the race.

6) Have tutorals to show you which bottons are used to play the event.

7) The replay is great.

Negatives:

1) Not very much events.

2) After a 1hour of play, the game get pretty boring.

3) Don't have that great of choices in athletes on it.

4) Should've had Heats and Finals for the events to show that you really worked to compete in the finals.

5) When you break the world record, they really don't make a big thing bout it on the game. A few cameras here and there but nothing dramatic.

Tips for improvements for any new ESPN Track & Field games:

1) Should have a atleast athletes to pick from under atleast 15 countries.

2) Enter more events such as: 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1500m, 110m hurdles, discus, hammer, shot put, javelin, high jump, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, 4x100m relay, 4x400m relay.

3) Have the record holder be able to compete in thier event in which they hold the record.

4) Improve the realisumn in the game (simular to the 2004 Athens)

5) Show medalist collecting medal on the medal stand.

6) Need a mixture of different country's music and not rock & roll for everything. Not everyone is a fan of rock & roll.

7) Give you the chance to create players and be able to train them (weight lifting, spint drills, sprint starts, endurance, jumps, etc.)for thier events so they can become stronger and also faster.

5.0,True,"06 1, 2013",A3GKEFY9J6J1O5,B00B59L9VO,Anthony Redfield,"I was quite shocked on how well the game came out. The game was originally for the Nintendo 3DS and it was quite good. The campaign is fairly long. Raid mode will add more replay value to the game once you beat the campaign. With a new mode (Infernal mode)add to the mix, I don't see why anyone will pass this up. Capcom updated the graphics and added a new creature in the game. Here's my brutal honest about the game.

The good things

- Capcom updated the atmosphere giving it an HD look to it. When your on the ship, the camera sways giving it the feel that your actually on the ship.

- The music is fantastic.

- Tight corridors are back! I had numerous experiences where i ran out of ammo and i walk backwards to a corner.

- Jill's campaign is survival horror while Chris's is more action horror.

- You can now evade (similar to RE3).

- Hold up to three weapons and store weapons you picked up in an item box (Oh yeah. They make a return).

- Upgrading weapons in campaign and raid mode is actually pretty neat.

- Raid mode is addicting (yes. Raid mode is also 2-player online. Not local).

- Controls are easy to get use to.

- Can aim and shoot. Even reload while moving.

The bad things

- Keith and Quint are by far the most annoying characters i've ever played.

- Annoying that your partner is with you somewhat of the game.

For this one, i'll let you decide whether this is a pro or a con

- In the old games, backtracking was quite common. In Revelations, it makes a return. There will be times where you have/choose to backtrack. Whether it's to advance the story or open the door that you have been waiting to open. Honestly, this is more of a pro in my opinion but others find this a con.

Overall, this game is extremely fun. I beat the campaign last night and i was pleased on how well capcom ported this game. With Infernal mode and raid mode in the game, i can see myself playing this game fairly long time. You won't be disappointed!",Resident Evil Revelations,1370044800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,False,"11 11, 2015",A10W2QTBTVV6RQ,B00YQ2MM2M,Jessie Scott,"Is Fallout 4 a perfect game?  Absolutely not.  Is it fun?  Definitely.

Things I like:
+The character customization is easy to use and ensures you can't make a truly disgusting character.
+The voice overs are extremely well done.  I like not reading the dialogue (note: you can turn on subtitles still) and just skipping ahead; the main character is well done and so are most of the supporting characters.
+Looking into containers can be done in real time.  You can still enter the container to loot all, but everything can be taken without going into another menu.
+Weapons and armor can be modified.  Most modifications will change the appearance.  The modifications have significant impact.
+During conversations, you can move around.  By interacting again, you'll go back into the cinematic mode.
+Power armor.  You feel POWERFUL in that piece of equipment.  They don't restrict it to ""heavy"" armor experts anymore ensuring everyone can use it.  It's more like a vehicle than an armor.
+Building settlements is fun.  I've spent way too much time already.
+Legendary enemies.  They keep you on your toes and will offer some fantastic rewards.
+Radiation Storms.  Foggy, green, and lightning.
+Perk system.  It replaces the old skill system and allows for a wide range of customization and play styles.  While not as clean as Skyrim's to navigate, I love the update here.

Things I don't like:
-No ultrawide monitor settings.  Consider games like Wasteland 2 have it, this is unacceptable.
-Stiff facial animations, wooden character movement.  The lips will move but the face remains stiff, creating awkward looking dialogue cinematics.
-Dated graphics.  Some of the textures are amazing.  I've ran into some really low resolution (some look straight out of Xbox/Playstation 2 generation).  I've also run into an LOD (level of detail) distance rendering bug at some quarry - the textures didn't switch over and it looked like Minecraft... it also created a veneer over the actual terrain causing me to fall through the textures and have difficulty navigating.
-Console controls.  While I don't personally have any trouble with the controls, it's very clear that the PC version was created with consoles in mind first.  The two worst culprits are keybindings not working an having to use the arrow keys IN ADDITION to WASD.  (The controls seem to work well on consoles).
-Companions are very powerful, even on the harder settings.  I play on the harder settings and I can sit back and let my companions take over 90% of fights.  The only times I need to help is if there is a legendary or particularly strong enemy.
-The difficulty of combat situations span a huge gulf.  It can go from a pathetically easy encounter to nearly impossible one minutes later.
-Bugs, bugs, bugs.  I had high hopes that after 6 years they would have ironed out more of the basic, common bugs.  Unfortunately I was wrong.

Neutral/No Opinion:
*Has many Skyrim like features including harvesting, interactive loads screens.
*Looks exactly like previous Fallout games.  Some minor differences, but you've seen this wasteland before.

It's easy to get caught up in wandering and exploring.  I find myself enjoying the discoveries and finding new weapons, armor, and items.  Settlements are a fun addition, though I hope there is more to them later.  This is definitely not a game of the year contender by any means.  However, it's still a ton of fun and if you're a Fallout fan, you'll enjoy going back into the wasteland.

I've seen super positive and super negative reviews.  This is not a 5/5 or a 9/10 out of 10 that I've seen professionals give.  It's also not a 1/5 or 4.7 on Metacritic.  This is most assuredly a 4 out of 5.

Edit: Folks that are looking at reviews, understand there is a trend right now of PC players being extremely negative towards this game.  My review upsets them because I actually enjoy the game.  Great game using a flawed engine where most of the issues tend to stem from.

If you purchase this on Steam, remember you can get a refund if you don't like it within 2 weeks or less than two hours played (whichever comes first).  I'd recommend setting a timer for an hour and a half to see if you like it.","Not Game of the Year, but Extremely Fun Regardless",1447200000,9,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

5.0,False,"01 3, 2015",A1KXJCXS6HFRQZ,B00OHJY7C2,Trent Steele,"This mouse is small and lightweight with quick buttons and fast performance.  Combined with some decent software, this mouse certainly seems to meet its expectations as a pure MOBA mouse.  As a general purpose mouse, it falls short, but it doesn't seem fair to judge it as such given that it's marketed as a MOBA mouse.  It also complements other Logitech gaming peripherals such as the keyboard.

This mouse is held not with a palm on top but gripped between the thumb and pinky.  Its lightweight makes it easily maneuvered, and the software allows for quick switches between DPI settings via toggle or modifier keypresses.  By that I mean you can swap DPI settings by depressing a button or you can quickly switch to a certain DPI simply by holding a key such that releasing the key would return it back to the previous DPI (much like the shift key is used to modify lower case).

The optical sensor on this mouse seems designed for performance rather than versatility.  So while it is extremely fast, it won't work on certain materials like clear glass.

It should also be noted that this mouse pales in comparison to most of Logitech's other gaming offerrings with regard to productivity.  It is not an ideal general purpose mouse.  It is meant to be quick and nimble and provide some level of customizability through the gaming software.  Its ideal use is precision clickery for strategy games, and for that I give it 5 stars.  Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",Quick and nimble; Great for precision click games.  Not an ideal productivity mouse.,1420243200,,{'Configuration:': ' Gaming Mouse'},

There are some awesome detailed reviews here already so I'll spare you the specs and just touch on the key points. If you enjoyed Marvel Vs. Capcom 1/2, Capcom Vs. SNK 1/2 then stop reading and buy this if you haven't yet. If you don't have a Wii, buy a Wii and buy this game. You probably won't recognize many/any of the Tatsunoko characters but that really doesn't matter. Those of you that grew up in the 80's might remember the characters from Gatchaman (G-Force in the states), anime freaks will recognize Karas but that's about it. The rest of the lineup haven't had much exposure over here if any...but they are all spectacular characters for the Vs. series. I love the graphics, the cell-shaded 3D is a perfect fit, makes me hopeful for MvC3 using a similar style (it could happen!). There is a ton of unlockable content, the shop system is pretty much like MvC2 was on the Dreamcast, single player is just as solid as multiplayer thanks to that. The gameplay is basically a simplified MvC2, don't worry though, plenty of depth for the hardcore. This is a 2 on 2 set up and you can freely swap your characters out to regain health, just like MvC. You have 3 attack buttons, light/medium/heavy, and a Partner/Assist button to call in your other character. I honestly don't think the strategy or depth is negatively impacted by a 4 button setup at all, once you play for a few hours you'll start to see how complex 4 buttons can be. I've played MvC2 for nearly 10 years, I have a PS3 and I love Street Fighter IV and BlazBlue but I can say without a doubt that this is the most fun I have had with a fighting game since playing Street Fighter 2 in the arcades all those years ago, only time will tell if it will stay fun for as long.

4.0,True,"07 28, 2016",A3AW2RWTOJONAW,B00VPWWCA8,Jacob Martin,"This controller is very good, to the point of almost feeling like a dualshock 3. It connects flawlessly and despite having an off switch it will go into a standby mode if left on without button presses for a few minutes. My only problem is that the analog sticks are stiff and thus the sensitivity is bad. That is, there is very little registration of a half push so, for instance, walking slowly in Metal Gear Solid 2 is a chore to do. Push slightly too far and it's an instant run, but not far enough amd you don't move. It's like there's a blind spot in the center. This also affects aiming, but this issue isn't a deal breaker. What might be a dealbreaker is that the pressure sensitivity of the face buttons is either just as difficult or nonexistent.

Both of these problems combined, this is still an amazing controller and most of the time you won't notice its faults. It's well built so it doesn't feel cheap in your hands and it's nearly identical to the dualshick 2 in terms of weight and feel while also being wireless. I don't know how long batteries last but I'm going to wager that they don't use a lot of power. I've played with it for about 30 hours and it hasn't stuttered on the connection (which would be the first sign of a low battery).

I've had a lot of fun playing inFamous. Sucker Punch got of lot of things right with the game, but some minor flaws keep the game from being perfect.

First, the good stuff. Love the open playground that is Empire City's three areas: the Neon District, the Warren, and the Historic District. Climbing buildings, riding the rails (literally), jumping off rooftops, etc. Cole's powers are great; I especially enjoy using Thunderdrop when jumping off a rooftop. The story missions are interesting, giving you a little bit of everything from search and destroy, escort missions, to one where you have to get rid of giant poison ballons, just like in Tim Burton's Batman movie, with the exception of not having the batwing. The side missions tend to get repetitive, but not to the point where you don't want to do them. The graphics, music, and sounds are excellent, with things like the jingling of Cole's backpack and the cries of the bystanders adding little touches to the game. The storyline is good, with some predictable twists. The Karma choices, which will determine your path, don't affect the overall storyline, but will affect the environment, your character's look, as well as how the public's reaction to you.

As for the flaws of the game: even though the platforming is fun, and at times vertigo inducing, its sometimes frustrating when you want Cole to jump or fall in one place and the game will just push him somewhere else. You will also occasionally see enemies or bystanders stuck in a falling animation, or Cole himself will get stuck when climbing a rail or a rooftop. The game is also a bit easy. I only died a few times, even on Hard mode, and the game only has 3 major boss fights.

But again, the flaws are things that will not get in the way of enjoying this game. So pop in the disc and start playing. The people of Empire City need a Hero... but that doesn't mean it has to be you.",What path will you choose?,1245024000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

And here we are...

Knights of Nine

-Good-

~Lengthy quest (5 hours), fun beginning, cool ending.  You get a new outfit with fairly nice benefits, nothing jaw dropping though.

~Kind of boss fight at the end in a cool environment(i don't want to spoil it)

-Bad-

~Half of the quest deals with you traveling all over the map to touch shrines(to become blessed), you have to find 8-9 of them.  You get a map, but the actual locations aren't marked on your main map so sometimes it takes longer then it should to find one.  Became some what tedious.

~More fetching type activites then actually meeting interesting characters, go in this cave to find this, go to this other cave to find that, etc...

~Everying thing besides the new boss where you fight the boss, and armor, you've seen before.

Shivering Isles

-Good-

~Very interesting story, great ideas and concepts.
~New environment, new weapons, new armor, new tougher enemies, great dialogue.
~Great main quest, and some entertaining side quests ( the first side quest i did; i was told by a distraught civilian that he hated his life and wanted me to kill him, but he didn't want to see it coming)
~You come across some interesting characters as mentioned above.
~Lengthy, i've put 15 hours into so far and am probably only half way done.
~Decent price, you get what you pay for, after all, $30 isn't cheap for an add-on.

-Bad-

~Review after review stats how different the two worlds are, mania(happy/energetic) and dementia(sad/angry), but honestly, they're not that different.  Don't get me wrong, you can tell which is which, but it's not nearly as extreme as i was made to believe.  Let's take leaves off trees and paint the vegetation in darker shades and call it dementia.  So far that's my only complaint.

For $30 this is a good deal because you actually get what you pay for.  An additional 30-40hours to an already extremly lengthy and well made game.  One side note, i bought this game downloaded it onto my 360, brought it my friends place and downloaded on his as well(he also had Oblivion).  Therefore, if you know someone else who wants it you guys should split the cost because you just download it on your hard drive and don't actually need the disc to play the game(you only need the Oblivion disc).","Shivering Isles and Knights of Nine, good add ons to a great game",1203292800,14,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

not as bad as they said BUT it was nowhere as good as Ninja Gaiden 1 or 2.

I really just bought this for the new characters & weapons & especially for the GORE/DISMEMBERMENT.
& I like that all the weapons are now available instead of as DLC $$$$.
also the other modes are there too for online etc.

the unlockables costumes, most of them were in previous games. i wish they had all new costumes.
that was a bit of a letdown. i think there are only 2 new costumes.
(if you have a save from the regular NG3 it gives you a cool costume too)

I do like the villain in this game. He has a very cool theme song.
music is good & there are some excellent tracks.
The AI in this game is still cheap. but not as grabby as the regular Ninja Gaiden 3.
the control does show some lag.
they never FIXED that awful T-rex boss.

I beat part 1 & 2 with all the weapons & many many times. I just don't see myself doing that with this game.

  Resident Evil: Action, Zombies, Intense Gore, Two-players Optional.

  Resident Evil 5 features a zombie epidemic.

  This review contains no spoilers.

  While I have not played the earlier Resident Evil titles, Res-Evil 5 does a good job on keeping you up to date if you haven't played them either. As stated above, Resident Evil features a zombie epidemic. With you as the hero, Chris Redfield (I call him Steroid-Man) and his partner Sheva, you work as an agent for the BSAA, (I forget what it stands for) an orginazation trying to maintain the balance of biotic weapons.

  Pros:

  Realistic Graphics - Res-Evil 5 combines realistic graphics and cutscene-looking movements of characters, making it look as if you're in a movie.

  Varying Enemies - You don't just fight mindless zombies the whole time (I should add that they have decent health, unlike some other zombie-titles), you also fight enemies like flying octopus-bat things and dogs that split their heads open to clamp it down on you. Not to mention all the unique bosses.

  Varying Bosses - Without giving anything away, I can promise that if you like Res-Evil 5, you'll love its bosses. Most of them are the size of buildings, taking heavy weapons to bring down.

  Currency - I'm sure there are players who don't like using money earned in the game on weapons to use in-game, but I thought it was a cool feature. Selling treasures that you find in the story mode (such as gold beetles, pricless jewelry etc.) gives you - that's right - money to buy weapons such as proximity mines, stun-rods, even grenade launchers.

  Keeping you Up-to-Date - Like me, if you haven't played the recent Res-Evil games, this game is pretty good at keeping you on track. Of course you would be better off playing the recent ones, but things such as flashbacks and game history on loading screens won't leave you too confused on the story.

  Multiplayer - If you get bored or stuck in the game, you can have two-player mode (not online, I might add) where you and your friend work together to overcome the bosses and zombie hordes. You can also go online and jump into someone else's game at any time (to prevent someone from joining yours, you can switch on ""Private"" Feature).

  Cons:

  Maturity Rating - As you have probably noticed this game has earned itself an M for mature. This is solely because of the gore and some swearing. There are some skimpy-clothed females in the game, but never anything too notable. It's all the gore, heads exploding etc.

  Frustrating Moments - I have encountered several instances in the game where an area is extremely hard. It might me the medium difficulty setting, but there are some bosses who will cause furstration.

  Unique Style of Gore - Resident Evil 5 not only has limbs blowing up all the time, but it also has some newer (and frankly more gorey than blood) versions of gore. It has - excuse the depth of description - heads exploding and being replaced by dripping tentacles, or zombies having messy worms coming out of the mouths to infect their victims. I've played a ton of gore games, but Res-Evil 5 is unique in that way.

  Overall I'd rate this game 3.75 stars, (but Amazon doesn't allow decimals), mainly because of (one-person's opinion) I prefer open-world and leveling games. Resident Evil 5 still makes a fun game throughout the journey, but after awhile going online and re-running the story can get kind of old.

Let's start with the single player/offline mode. I was excited for the character customization. The graphics were alright; nothing stellar but I'm not that interesting in graphics anyway. Once the game started, the problems began rolling in like a tsunami. The enemies are strangely persistent, the weapons are rather lame, the upgrades aren't all that exciting, and the game just feels like it's missing something. The maps are small, the missions are essentially go here, go there, kill x. When you're playing alone, you have to rely on some incredibly stupid AI bots. Whatever though. Nobody really expects shooters to have a good storyline or offline mode.

The online multiplayer aspect of this game is what absolutely kills this game. The combat is just clunky, the controls are terrible (though you can change the settings), and the classes are messed up. I have a decent wired internet connection (12mbps) and I found this game to be laggy as all hell. Even with the patch, this game is borderline unplayable online sometimes.

When I popped this game out of the 360, I was especially shocked to see that BETHESDA made this game. The people who brought us Oblivion and Fallout 3. I don't know what's going on at that company, but they've been turning out bad games left and right these days (New Vegas is the only other game I've rated poorly).

+ Guitar Hero = FUN
+ Aerosmith guitar style fits the gameplay well
+ perfect for fans of the band

Negative:
- it's exactly the same as GHIII
- really short and not too challenging

Guitar Hero is a franchise that has established itself in the gaming world with some of the most fun and addicting gameplay out there. With the first band-centered game in the series, GH: Aerosmith does a great job of delivering to fans of the band, but for the rest of us it's just more songs to play.

There are several reasons the game is best for fans of Aerosmith. The first reason is that the game's story is totally centered on the band (obviously) and there is band commentary between each of the game's six sets. They talk about their career and the high points highlighted in the game. There are also little fun facts about the band on the loading screens sometimes. One of the other cool things about the game is how the motion capture was done with the band, putting their own stage presence in every performance.

And then there's the game's setlist. While being very short (as in only 30 or so songs plus roughly 10 vault songs) it's very fun. It is, after all, Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero is always fun! The gameplay is exactly the same as it was a year ago in Legends of Rock, nothing at all has been added. In fact, everything else is either exactly the same or close to it; the menus are just themed differently, and the multiplayer and online is exactly the same.

So we have established that the game is perfect for Aerosmith fans, right? So what exactly does it offer for those of us who haven't followed or even listened to the band? Well, we get more of the same fun gameplay like I said before. We also get some new songs, many of which are really fun. Most of the songs in the setlist aren't very hard to beat, but there are a few tough ones such as `Crazy Train.'

Aerosmith's guitar style is really quite good for the game. There are a lot of parts with chords, a lot of cool hammer-on sections, and some awesome solos that are very satisfying to nail down to the last note. So while the setlist isn't very long at all and offers little challenge (I beat the career within less than 24 hours of getting the game... on Expert), it is very fun.

The game's sound quality is pretty good. The quality of the songs is great, but the volume equalization is pretty bad. The game will be way too loud on the menu and then pretty quiet during actual gameplay, which is strange and annoying. Of course the guitar squeaks are still pretty annoying, and the crowd actually claps off beat to the song when you activate star power. Other than those few problems the sound quality is good.

The graphics, on the other hand, are either equal to Legends of Rock or possibly a tad worse.  The Wii version of the game, at least, has visuals that could have been improved. Two of the big areas they could have improved on are those of hair movement and guitar playing. Some of the lighting effects are good, though. Overall the graphics could have (and should have) been better, the Wii is capable of more than this.

So to sum it all up, Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is a good game. While it mainly caters to fans of the band it is all about, it's still an enjoyable, albeit short, experience for those of us who just like Guitar Hero. It's definitely worth a rent for fans of the franchise, worth a buy for fans of the band, and almost worth fainting over for any combination of the two.

A decent PC gaming machine and patience. It finally came out for PC and despite the awful reviews and horror stories, I just had to risk it.

Okay, this game got butchered for the DRM and the crashes. I agree with everyone as I suffered through an install meltdown. I installed the game, I tried to play it and the dreaded red x box came up stating some wierd technical reason. My heart sunk and I felt like I just bought a 50 dollar coaster. I decided to go to their website for some help. Don't do it! The website was not helpful in the least. So frustrated, I called technical support. Surprisingly, he was extremely helpful despite the thick indian accent. He moved me step through step every click of the way and solved the problem! Throughout technical support was great, but it should have never gotten to that point in the first place. So I agree with everyone on that point. DRM punishes honest customers. It's total (explative).  By no means do I plan on playing this game on more than one computer so why put a limit. This is a pure one person game, it's not an MMO so what's with the paranoia? Why limit it to 3? Worse is you need to be online to authenticate the game not once but forever! Once again, this is not an MMO so now you are punishing people who do not have internet access in their homes. Not cool. If this was any other game, I gaurantee I would not buy it. It is only because I don't have any other means of playing it.

Okay, now to the game. Does anyone remember Starflight for the Sega Genesis back in the day? Yeah I'm showing my age. Anyway this is Starflight the next generation! I always hoped for a sequel for the PC or next gen consoles. Alas it never happened but Mass Effect is the same exact thing! From the the free form explaration map, to your alien crew, to even the Mako! Except for the true imersion from exploring your own ship to exploring other worlds on foot, to traveling in the mako. On and on and on. The graphics are beyond amazing in my opinion especially during dialog sessions. The faces are amazing looking. The voice acting is top notch, the music is amazing too. I kind of want the soundtrack of this. The story line is great with plenty of side missions to keep you very busy and a neat little romantic subplot which adds to the space opera feel. This led to some paranoid attacks from fox news and middle aged men and women who not only never played this game but never played video games in their lives. When the so called ""sex"" scene came to fruition. I laughed. This stuff is so mild compared to MTV which ""your kids"" watch every single day. Tila Tequila is hardcore porn compared to this.

Now for the bad. The combat system truly sucks. You cannot control the AI characters period. I just let them go and do their thing and pretty much fight on my own. The shooting and targets are not crisp and definite like 1st person shooters which is what this combat is trying to be. The inventory system takes a long time to get used to and is not efficient. It's so unpractical that you end up amassing equipment just because you don't want to go into the inventory system. The game certainly lags and I have a decent rig which I will list at the end of this review. I have never had a crash but at times it seems like it will freeze for a few seconds when I move to the main menu and makes me think it is ready to crash but eventually goes to the menu. Dialoge sometimes skips but not often. These gripes are trumped by the fun factor. The fact is the game played through without crashing once and even though your have combat a lot, your interest lies more in the story and advancing the story.

If you have an x box 360 get it for that, but if you don't have one it just might be worth the risk, but make darn sure you have the right pc specs!

I've probably played through that entire game 4 or 5 times (on both PS3 and PC).  Naturally, my expectations for FC4 was pretty lofty and for the most part, they've been met.

First things first - it's a gorgeous game, even on medium settings.  I was able to capture a few screen shots on ""ultra"" and if your rig can run it, you're in for a treat.  It's simply beautiful.  Character models and environments are superb.  I'm sure the same holds true for PS4 and XBox1 versions.  It's the cream of the crop.

Secondly, this is a VERY familiar game.  All the mechanics, as far as I can tell, are exactly the same, as are the skill trees.  There are two trees (Tiger and Elephant), but a quick glance through them reveals they're pretty much the same.  Other similarities: the guns are identical and you still get a lot of the same side quests.  You'll get to liberate bell towers instead of radio towers.  Among the new additions: using bait to lure animals and throwing knives (don't require a takedown like in FC3), the gyrocopter and the surprising inclusion of choice in missions.  You'll occasionally have to choose between missions (the other mission will cancel out).  I'm also glad the hang gliders are still around as that's my favorite, leisurely mode of travel.

As for the story, well, it's just OK.  After a brilliant and original set up, including an opening scene that's just wonderful (thanks to Troy Baker's Pagan Min), the story is just kind of so-so, largely because the Ajay, the protagonist, is about as exciting as Jason Brody from FC3.  It seems that with Far Cry games, the villains get the best dialogue and are far more interesting characters.  Troy Baker is fantastic, as he usually is (he's on quite a run playing the lead characters in The Last of Us, Infamous Second Son, COD: Advanced Warfare, Bioshock Infinite, etc).  His Pagan Min is truly unhinged, yet utterly magnetic thanks to Baker's performance.

Now to the technical bits. If you want the full experience, you're going to need a hefty rig.  I've had to content myself with my graphics set to medium.  My buddy, who also has the game (we were conversing over the phone while playing at the same time), has two video cards and he can't run the game on ""ultra"" settings.  The game also crashed after 15 minutes of the opening cut scenes and I had to watch those 15 minutes of cut scenes a second time.  When I tried to set my graphics to ""NVidia"" settings, I got a 15 minute freeze in which I couldn't do anything.  Very frustrating.  Ubisoft has said there will be a day one patch, so hopefully that will rectify some of the issues.  By the way, it's a 21 gig download and then another 30-40 minutes to ""unpack"" it.

In short, if you enjoyed FC3, you'll enjoy FC4.  Just don't expect any huge leaps forward.  What you get is a big beautiful sandbox with lots to do, fantastic gunplay and sneaking bits, and a terrific villain every bit as entertaining as Michael Mando's Vaas from FC3.

I don't know that it's absolute must buy (especially on PC in which it be under $10 in six-nine months) at this point.

Waiting 12 years for a game doesn't mean it's going to be 12 years worth of great development.

You want to berate the developers and executives, then fine; but have some objective analysis on the game at least.

From a very casual gamer's standpoint, the game is fun.  Most enjoyable about it is that it doesn't take itself seriously.  Most of the content is absurd and crude but that's the appeal of the game.  Cut away scenes are comical and entertaining.

Unfortunately, graphics aren't the best and a lot of times I found myself lost, not understanding what I was suppose to do next.  I will also agree with most who said a lot of the game play is somewhat redundant and mundane.

I've never used Google so much on a game to find out how to solve dead end problems.  The ending was also terrible...I'm not sure it even made sense to me.

Now u have most likely see some of the s*** the ""game press"" is talking about the X1 will they should just work for FOX News or the PS magazine they want Sony to winning because they scared of MS winning again  .

 So all talk to the hardcore gamers first I've been a core game most of my life and the X1 is a dream come true and here way the X1 has better games it gets all the big game + titanfall and no matter what you might have heard EA and respawn has reapply said its not coming to PS4 Sony is just hoping the rumors will hurt X1 hardware sales off of titanfall and X1 also has Halo 5 and Halo 2 anniversary, gears of war, KI is great, a partnership with EA, DR3, the best racing games, and Xbox live you can't be a core MP gamer with out X live its light year better then PSN + MS has never lost cord numbers so its more safe for your $ and the X1 OS is fast and  mind blowing 5 app and one game can be running at the same time and you can switch instantly between them, with your X1 controller or much faster and cool with Kinect now that not because the controller is slow its because you can said what you want and it instantly go to it the first time 95% of the time and MS will release updates,  so I can be play BF4 or TB and with 2 words be watching Dexter on Netflix and instantly switch back to TB and it'll  just be paused waiting for you and then you can go back to Netflix with one word and it will continue what you were watching instantly or you can use the guide button and just going to the Netflix app and you'll get the same thing has use Kinect just not has fast . And about the Kinect, will I didn't like the idea to start with but now I love it make everything so quick and it has been really cool in game like in TB you can just say what gun you want and it will switch instantly so I can be using my bow at long range and say shotgun to soot the guy who coming up on were I'm aiming at him and it will switch so I don't have to stop aiming, and of this cool Tony Stark and star trek s*** does not interest you can't always turn the Kinect off or just unplug it from your X1 and run it over with your car and you can still do everything with your X1 you could do with your X1 with the Kinect plugged in. The Xbox one is just getting start of you don't get one you'll be sorry latter way pay 400$ now just so you can pay 500$ in a year or so or let Sony loose your cord numbers or get a f up console the PS4 is the most over rated console I ever play its doesn't do anything new or interest I can't believe how many people are acting like its better then X1  so I fill very strongly about this because I feel like people or being lied to so they don't even give the X1 a chance and don't know that they're missing something special .

And for the casual gamer I on the 100$ less is tempting but you are really loosing at lest 150$ in value . The X1 is great for everyone with its movie a TV apps it will take over your living room and everyone in your household will want to use it your teenagers son or will love all the games your wife will love the Kinect and its game like zoo tycoon and everyone will love the TV and Movie apps and the Kinect is great of you are cooking or working .

And if you're the kind of parson who love game but only has like a hour a week the X1 is sweet because it will always keep your place and restart instantly so when you have to leave you can just say Xbox off and it will not loose your place and its with restart in like 10 sec when you get home I love the X1 and I think you will too I hope you will give it a try",so i love the X1 this is way,1392336000,3,,

The world of the Witcher was extraordinary. CD Projekt Red has become one of the best developers in the gaming industry. They released free DLC that other companies (EA) would have charged for. Now they have released two paid expansions Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. You can buy both at 25 dollars, which is fantastic considering that companies charge nearly full price for DLC.

In the first DLC Hearts of Stone you rejoin Geralt the white wolf, as he must grant three wishes to a man named Olgierd Von Everec an enigmatic man with an even more enigmatic adversary Gaunter ODimm. Olgierlds requests have Geralt attending a wedding, planning a heist, and exploring a haunted house. Hearts of Stone is simply one of the best-written quests ever as it puts focus on the antagonist. Something the main game ignored as a result we have a better villain than the main story. The DLC brings old flame Shani from the first game and she is truly a great character a far cry from Yennefer and Triss.

It's not as much fun because it's a serious workout--there are no points to be scored or records to break--but it delivers what it promises.  I use both this and the Wii Fit as the two complement each other well. My Fitness Coach gets me what sessions with a personal trainer would (but for a much smaller investment)--a prescription for workouts that continually challenge my muscles, target certain areas, push me and keep me interested.

Pros:
It pushes you! You let Maya, your trainer, know how hard each series of exercises is for you and she adjusts for future workouts.

Great variety of exercises--you won't get bored! You can choose different focus areas for your workouts in addition to your long-term goal. It incorporates equipment you already have: hand weights, step bench, heart monitor and/or stability ball, which also keeps it interesting.

It's easy to see how the moves are done by watching Maya (although they're probably trickier at first for someone who hasn't done aerobics or dance before.)

You get a continuous workout session as the exercises are pre-selected--you don't have to deal with the menus and such that you do in between activities in Wii Fit.

You can track progress--even in the form of measurements, heart rate, etc. You can also track your other workouts.

It's better than a workout video as the routines are always different and you have a good variety of music and scenery to choose from.

You don't have to have a Wii Fit as it doesn't use the balance board. This is a much less expensive game.

Cons:
I didn't see this in any of the other reviews but the aerobics is not all low impact. I have to be careful with my back so I modify some of the moves to make them low impact--but someone not familiar with the difference may not realize the need or know how to do that.

The tutorials are hard to use except at the beginning of the workout. It could just be me but I don't seem to grab my remote and get it pointed properly in time before the tutorial is grayed out or gone.

The buttons are narrow and can be tricky to click on with the remote.

You do need some room to use this and you need to grab equipment quickly.  I've found that if I get things arranged and handy ahead of time, it's not a problem even though I have fairly limited space.

I wish it had a page that showed all past workouts with time length and focuses--I prefer that functionality on the Wii Fit as it gives me a strong sense of accomplishment and motivation to keep going and logging time.

This was a game from Sega that was probably rushed.  Basically, you are a viking warrior, championed by a Goddess to thwart the plans of her 'evil' sister, Hel.  So you go to different islands (not too many... and don't get your hopes up, there are no boats that you use) conquering the lands, learning a few new moves, finding money and doing small tasks.  To me, this wasn't a bad game.  It was relatively short, pretty direct and very easy to play.  It didn't present impossible challenges, though the 'sneaking' missions could be difficult.  Another positive in the game were the battle scenes, which did a decent (though nto spectacular) job at scale of battle.

But what blows is that the game could've been infinitely better if they'd taken more time on the story, some minor bugs and adding more features and details and definitely more options for game-play.  For example, the 'map' you use is pretty bad.  It's not to scale at all.  It makes things look like they're extremely far away, yet when you go back to the game-play, you can sometimes see the very town that looked miles away on the map.  Also... you have to be careful when you're slowly crawling along cliff edges.  My character fell through magical 'solid' rock a few times.  Oh, and the map was terrible at routes, as those mountains made you often run around seemingly to no end.

As for the game-play criticism... I don't think I'm the only one that thought it would have been cooler to have the vikings take-over the camps from the sea.  They just sort of appear there, but there was an opportunity to do something cool, like invade with the viking ships, slaughter what was there before, or even have some battle at sea or at least present some decent cinema.  And as for the battles, while they were ok, more moves for the champion would've been nice and forget about fighting if you or the enemy are on even the slightest of hills.  You'll miss everytime.  And what was the deal with the dragons?  You expected them to at least be able to do something cool with each new one that came up.  But for all you do to summon them, it was kind of goofy and nonsensical to have them unavailable so much.  I won't even get to the last level...

There's nothing terribly wrong with Prototype, but there's nothing particularly amazing- so, I would normally  give it an average rating- 3 stars. However, the gameplay IS pretty fun, so I'm going to give it 4 stars.

Gameplay: What is there to say? You're a superpowered man who can eat people and disguise yourself as them, drive a ton of vehicles than can wreak havok, walk up the sides of buildings, and bash helicopters in with your bare hands. The game is quite fun to play.

Plot: With some ups and downs, Prototype's plot is pretty good. We have a formula that interests the viewer: You wake up with no recollection of what's happened, and you have all these strange abilities. The military is hunting you, and you need to survive while you find out the truth. The plot has cutscenes in which you're talking to a masked character, who is not revealed until later, as you ""recollect"" (play through) events. Combined with the amount of the plot that is gained on the side by finding ""web of intrigue"" targets and consunming them, you find out a lot without having it spoonfed to you. While it's not the quickest way to get a story told, it certainly is an interesting approach, and one that I enjoyed. Points to activision for that.
At the same time, some moments are predictable, and there are some plot points that are...the best way I can describe it is ""meh"". Still, I thought I knew who the final boss would be. I was wrong.

Video: Another area where Prototype has nothing flagrantly wrong, but nothing amazing. Prototype runs at 720P on either console (360 or PS3), it doesn't look bad, but if you look, you can tell. The graphics aren't superb or bad. Unlike inFAMOUS (which I bought at the same time), the city feels pretty generic and boxy. The game has some low quality textures at points, but it is respectable graphically throughout.

Audio: I don't currently have a surround sound system, so I can't speak for directional sound. The music of the game is pretty good, and the sound effects are decent. One particular criticism I have is that the voice acting is of VERY inconsistent quality- like they did everything in one take. There are some lines that are so poorly delivered you have to cringe. The script itself is not too bad though, and the web of intrigue scenes (many) have a ton of voices, so props on variety.

Controls: An area where I will give Prototype props.  The controls are pretty intuitive as a whole, which is great with the amount of havoc you wreak. You'd expect jumping up like Superman and hopping onto a helicopter, ripping the door off, and hijacking it to be hard, but the game does pretty well. It doesn't absolutely baby you, but it's intuitive (with the occasional inevitable bugs).

Length: There's a decent amount of side material and missions to add value to the game. Thankfully, they were able to do so without making the game feel artificially stretched out.

Overall: This game is fun to play, and it's pretty well priced. I can recommend it. It's not a legendary title, but it's a solid title by any means.","Pretty decent, but not all that memorable.",1257984000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

Compared to Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword feels more open from the beginning and feels a bit less surreal. On the other hand, it also seems to fall prey to more of the standard Japanese fantasy cliches, such as the story centering around a bunch of kids who are part of a school/academy.

So of course when they announced that twisted metal was coming back.. I lost it. I was just so happy. However David Jaffe: creator of TM said that they were going to be targeting a T (teen) rating for the game, AND that they were only going to have 4 drivers.  I was concerned to say the least. But David later said that they would be dropping the quest to get a T rating, and would embrace the M rating that Twisted Metal truly deserves.

Well here is Twisted Metal... Is it any good... oh HECK yes!.... Could it have been better.... Actually... Yes.

The main reason this game suffers is because this feels lackluster in single player content compared to the master peace that was Twisted Metal: Black (My all time favorite game, aside from Silent Hill 2) My MAIN complaint is.... Why the heck is there only 3 stories?! Twisted Metal: Black had over 15+ stories, and they were all GREAT. Twisted Metal: Black was pretty much an anthology horror movie. But with this new one.. we get 3. Sweet Tooth, and Dollfaces story were great... With Mr. Grim being a been there done that, sort of story.  And if you just played the story straight through you could beat it in well under 3 hours.... I love the way they did the live action / cgi cut-scenes though. I would love to see a real movie!

BUT! Trust me... Where this game shines is in the FLAWLESS gameplay. If you grew up playing twisted metal like I did.. Then you will feel right at home... Plus almost everything is destructible in the game!

So, thanks to Creed I know that Ubisoft has the potential to make some really great games that are stunning and fun to play, unlike later COD's, which have grown rather stale. The reason why I guess I pre-ordered this game was due to my love for Far Cry 3 on PS3. Such a great and fun game. Anyway, long story short, I'm very glad I did. Zombiu was my favorite game for the Wii u, much better than Blops2. But, this far and away surpasses even that.

Anyway, if you have a wii u, get this game. If you don't, you are doing yourself a great disservice; as this is the greatest wii u game to date and implements all its features beautifully.

Right away the bold and colorful world grabbed my attention.  The crazy thing, this entire world is based purely around solving puzzles.  It was quite a bold idea, especially making such a extreme departure from the Jonathan's Blow last game Braid.  The development cycle was long but well worth the wonderfully polished game that was the result.  Built upon a beautiful island, The Witness is a very challenging and rewarding puzzle game that will simulate your brain for hours on end.

The concept seems simple enough.  Scattered around this island is hundreds of panels.  All these panels having a starting point and an ending point.  Its your job to draw a line to connect the two ends.  The challenge is each section of puzzles will throw different obstacles at you.  Just to give  couple examples; this could include separating blocks of different colors, matching up sets of circles, to making specific shapes as you draw your line.  When you enter a new area you'll usually find a sets of five side by side panels that function as tutorials.  This game will never tell you what to do, it instead relies one you to be smart enough to progress.

This game is deceptively straight forward.  There is so much more to this game then just walking from one panel to the next.  There are a series of well hidden bonus puzzles tied to the mysterious black monoliths scattered around the island.  One of my favorite things I found was the movie theater.  The theater itself isn't too difficult to open but you'll need to have truly mastered the various puzzle elements to find the movies.  A boat is available to take you around the island and may help you notice things you may not have seen before.

The amazing artwork combined with the island setting really sets the mood for this game.  You really start to feel like your on a luxurious island retreat.  Pillows and couches can be found lying about inferring that the challenge of these puzzles my make one self tired over time.  Various ledges and buildings will give you breath taking views of the island.  It amazing to see this huge island you've spent hours exploring and conquering seem so shrunken from up high.  Those who crave exploration will want to explore every nook and cranny of this world for its abound with secrets.

I you like to challenge yourself and test your intellect you need to play this game!  The puzzles are numerous and the different sections of the game are superbly designed.  In each area they'll start you off with fairly straight forward puzzles and slowly add more complexity.  By the time you get to the end of a section you'll be amazed at the crazy things you've able to accomplish.  If the puzzles weren't rewarding enough every secret you find will bring a burst of joy and excitement.  The incredibly high ceiling of challenge with no written or spoken tips means that this game isn't for everybody but those who can keep their cool will find a wonderful sense of accomplishment playing through this game.",A puzzle game that is just as challenging as it is rewarding.,1478649600,2,,

What makes this game great is the gameplay.  It is simply one of the best FPS I've ever played.  I rank it right up there with Medal of Honor.
Probably the closest game it resembled that I've ever played is Red Faction. (I'm told it's close to Half Life but I haven't played that one). As the last of a group of super cyborg warriors, you will battle aliens through several different missions and levels.  You will encounter a variety of weapons and vehicles to use to complete your missions.  Although the game primarily takes place as a FPS, when driving a vehicle the perspective is in the third person view.
One of the interesting twists of this game is the fact that at any given time, you can only carry two weapons.  Which means as you find different weapons, you have to make strategic choices about which ones to keep.  A lot of the weapons are really fun to use, (I love the sniper rifle) but often not very practical.  The vehicles can be difficult to control but once you get the hang of it, it will just add to the fun.
The control interface is laid out very well and while awkward at first, you'll soon get accustomed to it and find it very easy to use.  As you progress through the game you will complete checkpoints and you can save the game after any checkpoint.  If you're killed, you're taken back to the last completed checkpoint.  The game has 4 levels of difficulty and even the easy level can be challenging in latter missions.  About 3/4ths of the way through, you'll encounter a new alien group that just puts a whole new twist on the game.
My only real complaint about the game is that a lot of the maps are used over and over, and the levels can be quite long (I played this game for hours) which sometimes leads to getting lost as each room you enter looks EXACTLY like the room you just left.  I would have like to have seen a little more variety.
I've read some reviews where some people complain that the game becomes repetitive and I can't completely disagree with that, but it didn't really seem to matter as the game continues to be fun all the way through.

I only knew that the bass pedal that came with the game felt terrible, and that it needed to be fixed.  I did a Google search for bass drum pedal mods, and the Pedal Metal was the first hit.  I navigated to the product page on Amazon, and found that ""Billet with Hinge"" was the most expensive (and therefore best, right?) trim of this product.  Without further ado, I plopped down the $30 + shipping.

When this product came, I realized that it was simply two pieces of metal that you screw on to the existing pedal (one on the main part, and one on the heel plate) and a piece of clear plastic.  The piece of clear plastic replaces the hinge that comes with the pedal.  It all seemed kind of strange, and I was wondering why this would be an improvement.  But I figured, hey, sure, why not?

So I proceeded to hack up my pedal beyond any sort of returnable/warranty-able condition and installed this product.  It didn't take very long to install, maybe about 10-15 minutes.  When I was done, I  felt like the improvement in looks would be worth it if nothing else.

Then I started playing.

Wow, what a difference.  The pedal is now very responsive and firm. Now I can actually hit the fast bass drum notes with some sort of consistency and more confidence.

I was so excited for this game, that i picked up the 360 version when it came out because i didn't have a PS4 yet and i just wanted to experience the game. I played it and thinking to myself ""Really? this is battlefield?"" thought, well, maybe it'll be better on the next gen consoles. Nope.

Remember how most other battlefield games made you fight tooth and nail to unlock the best weapons and attachments? Well now everyone starts with most of em and the others take all of two hours to unlock.

Remember when battlefield was all about effective teamwork and cooperation? Now, it's 64 people who rarely work as squads, running and gunning and camping in corners with weapons that kill in two or three bullets. I enjoyed battlefield for the strategic game play. I played cod for the fast paced arcade feel. Dice tried to imitate the twitch shooter style of Cod and failed miserably. Oh and remember Squad specs that you could use to help out your buddies. They're gone too and replaced with a system that only benefits you, which just adds to the lone wolf style of play.

Remember when having armor or aircraft on your side gave your team an advantage over infantry? That's gone too. Now 2/3rds of all players are engineers with one of the ten new rocket types that will rip your tank apart and cause your jet to start spinning right into the ground.
Remember when the entire environment was your sandbox to destroy? Now, very few buildings even have destructible walls and you will get caught on odd pieces of landscape every single time you try to vault over something. Instead of bringing every building down until the map is almost flat from the constant explosions as seen in previous games, we have lagolution whereby most maps are changed in some massive but largely useless manner that is aesthetically pleasing but really does not change much in terms of gameplay.
Remember fluid gameplay? Lag. Lag everywhere. Today a guy shot me out of his ass. Don't wanna know how. He was facing the other direction and rounds just started spraying from his pooper. Gotta love it.

Remember partying up with friends to play? That's gone.

Remember being able to change your classes outside of actually being in a game and being able to quickly change to a new gun for your class. Well, now you have to wait for a little personal island to load for you just so you can adjust your classes. Might as well join a game. Oh and wanna try to navigate the menus? Too bad. It's menu after menu after menu.

Like your controls in battlefield 3. Too bad.

Remember when one or two organized squads could effectively change the fate of a game. Well say hello to zulu squad with one man in it and two to three people in most others. Even if you have four buddies and you guys are all working together, it won't make much difference. Prepare to be mobbed by ten people wielding weapons that can kill you with a stray round to the chest or three to the foot.

Remember how awesome sniping used to be? Well say hello to morons trying to quick scope and every single class running around with DMRs. Oh and remember how carbines gave the engineers a crutch to stand on to make up for their lack of specialized anti infantry weapons, well now you get PDWs and everyone gets the carbines! But don't worry, people only use two of them anyways and you start with arguably the best one! Dont even get me started on the useless repair tool. Wanna try to get your buddy in the tank back up to full health. Too bad. It'll take you about five minutes to completely heal something and he's been hit by four rockets by now and you've died in the explosion.
Remember having helpful teammates that would destroy any anti-tank mines they spotted (very few people spot anymore either) so that a teammate wouldn't run over them? Better look out now, because the ground is covered in mines and your team will mostly just ignore them unless they feel especially generous for some odd reason.

I've tried to play the game for what it is but it just isn't battlefield to me. At this point, i'm going to get my last few map packs since i bought premium and then when I've played through those, i'll move onto something else. Hopefully Dice won't fail us with Battlefront. But due to this game, there is no way i'm buying the game right out the door. I'll wait and see what people think. Used to be a die-hard fan for dice who bought every product. Now, just really disappointed.
The only reason i'm not giving this game a 1,is because i like to believe Dice can do better. I like to think EA is to blame for most of the problems, but then i look at the game-play itself, and wonder, what was Dice thinking?  The only redeeming aspect going for them is that Dice is actively (if not slowly) trying to fix the problems in this never-ending beta, so at least they have that going for them.

4.0,False,"02 8, 2008",A2EOCDPEG6K1WQ,B000RPKCTC,Mark Lahren,"I really hated to ding this game a star for ""overall"", because I'm really in love with it. But let's get the bad out of the way first. Graphically, I love the way it looks, but in a retro sort of way. nothing fancy, but gets the job done. The open areas are done well, and some of the buildings are nice, but I found it odd that none of the huge buildings had functional windows. Possibly a limitation of the game engine. I'm having zero problems with the controls. There is a slight adjustment to using them, but the tutorial mission does a great job of training you in quickly. I'm using my 4-year-old Athlon XP2600+ with a gig of ram and a 7800GS video card, and I'm getting good framerates with every option maxed, so it runs very smooth even on lesser hardware.

This game is definitely not for everyone. Each mission requires a great deal of patience to get through. If you're a shooter fan, look elsewhere. This is more akin to a third-person ""Thief"" game, with some major differences. ""Death To Spies"" has an overhead map. And you will be lost without it. The map is moveable and resizeable, so I put mine down in the right corner and made it small. I refer to it constantly, since it shows you the location of each enemy, their direction of travel, which way they are facing, and whether or not your disguise is good enough to fool which ones. Changing uniforms is easy to do. Knocking out the person to get his uniform is less easy, and requires strategy and patience to get them alone somewhere, and then carry the body someplace like a closet without being spotted.

Tension in this game is through the roof, much like ""Thief"". If you are on the fence about this game, I HIGHLY recommend downloading the demo first, which is the first mission of the game. The demo gives a VERY good indicator of what the rest of the game is like. The demo also pulls no punches, and is quite difficult. It took me nearly four hours to complete it, but as in all the missions in this game, there is a HUGE sense of accomplishment upon finishing a mission. Each mission consists of multiple objectives, which you can generally complete in any order, and there is also a huge sense of accomplishment when you hear the clicking typewriter signalling that another objective has been completed. The game is linear only in that you must complete all objectives. How you go about doing that is generally up to you, with a few caveats. Those exceptions though are common sense, and make sense within the gameworld.

There are 10 missions total. I'm currently in Mission 7. The first 4 missions took 2 to 4 hours each to complete. Now that I'm getting more familiar with how the AI works, the last few missions have taken less than 2 hours each.

Totally immersive and utterly involving, you can lose yourself in a game like this. Thankfully, you can save anywhere, save often, and quicksave anywhere you like. The one thing that bugged me most is the lack of a first-person point of view. I generally never touch a third-person game, as I hate having my character block my view, but I can easily overlook that for a game as well-crafted as this one. The level design is outstanding. You can tell that the developers put a lot of love into this creation. I'm eagerly looking forward to a sequel, though that may not be likely since this game is pretty hard-core and may not appeal to the masses. But if you've got patience, and like to sit and stare at the screen, plotting your best plan, and then executing it carefully, then I can give this game a very high recommendation.","Not for everyone, but I'm loving it.",1202428800,,,

You are among the best of the best, selected to be to track down the last of the dragon knights and bring them to justice for their role in killing the divine and enabling Damien to wage a never ending war against the people of Rivellon.

You arrive at the settlement of Farlight and proceed to the ceremony that will finally make you a dragon knight, think Mass Effect Specters, turns out though they leave out one tiny little detail about the process. You gain the wisdom of the dragons, but the transfer effectively blasts out of your brain all the skills that you have learned over the last few years. Which means you now know the secrets of the dragons, but you have a hard time remembering which end of the sword to swing at the enemy.

You are assured that your former skills will return quickly once you start practicing them and you won't be taking on any dragons anyway for quite some time so there is nothing to worry about.  Of course soon afterward there are rumors about a Dragon Knight being spotted flying over a nearby outpost and your superior dispatches you to find out if there is any truth to the rumors.

It turns out the dragon sightings are real and you will be fighting sooner than you thought. Just not on the side you thought or for who you thought....

------------

 I usually like games that don't follow the ""norms"" of the genre and attempt to do their own thing.  Which means I am usually forgiving of rough edges and what have you as long as the game works well enough to be interesting.  This game is also well written which made it easy to ignore some of the mechanics, just so I could see what would happen next.  That was the case with this game until I came to the part, defeating damien's generals, were it was necessary to mostly deal with all the aspects of the game that can be very frustrating when taken by themselves.

At this point I had done everything else that was available up to that point, so I had nothing left to mix in to keep the game play varied and interesting. So my recommendation if you play this game, is in the second half make sure that do a few side quests and then take out a general. Then maybe the game won't grind to a halt like it did for me. Other than that I recommend this game for anyone who likes a rpg with a decent story and tries to do it's own thing, mostly succeeding.

Time Played:
About 30 hours. I got very near the end of the main quest before I hit a brick wall.  I still recommend the game though.

Graphics / Sound:
Not a big deal to me. They do the job, their not going to set any benchmarks.

Game play:
This one is hard.  For the most part everything works. But it's easy to see where they probably had this great idea and then couldn't do it because of budget constraints or technical restrictions. One of the best examples is that in dragon form the player can only attack creatures in the air and not on the ground, but on the ground the player can attack things in the air.  I just get the feeling that everything was supposed to be a lot more fluid and that didn't happen for some reason.  Other than that there are rough edges everywhere, but there are some cool elements like being able to make your own critter from various parts you find lying around and you can also read NPC's minds to get more dialogue options and rewards.

Story:
This is one of those I wish I could have forced myself to finish, If only there was less generals!, because it is interesting and well written. For the most part the quests and the dialogue is not stereotypical and boring.  Some of it made me think and quite a bit of it got a chuckle out of me.  If only...

I'd played the demo on XBox live but wasn't altogether convinced since the demo was very simplistic. (That only covers the tutorial portion of the game.) This game is about engaging as the games of Elder Scrolls  or Dragon Age series . The customization options are not quite as extensive. Overall, however, there is plenty here for a gamer who enjoys exploration and adventuring.

There were some unique things about this game. I loved that I could fall from any height and not take any damage. That sure made me more willing to be nosy. There are many puzzles in this game so be prepared to think rather than mindlessly mashing buttons to advance.

I only had two gripes. First was the button mapping. Initially I had some problems with the buttons becoming unbound in the middle of a battle. If you hold any button a fraction of a second too long, up pops the mapping screen. I don't know if this is my fault or the fault of the layout.  I also take issue with the long load times. I don't know if this is par for the course for these games, but I did find it frustrating to be twiddling my thumbs waiting for a game to load. Especially after dying.

Well I grew up playing video games and I still play them today.  And I figure if there is any way you are ever going to get me to exercise it is probably going to be through playing another video game.

And that is where Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012 comes in.

I never played the previous game so I unfortunately cannot compare the two.
What I can say though is that I am very impressed by what a video games can do in terms of giving you a good workout.

I have had issues with other Kinect games for the Xbox 360 not picking up my body or not recording my actions, but I did not have this problem with this game.

I found the key to be sure to be at least 8 feet back from your television and give yourself plenty of clear space to move.

Other reviewers have a done a great job of describing the specific exercises and programs.  They are real workouts that use your whole body.  My only complaint and I have this with many exercise games is that the game doesn't really ""tell"" you what to do in a fitness program.  Instead you just set a goal and are then left to your own devices to fulfill it.  I would really enjoy a game that could offer me some expert advice as to how to work out and what kind of exercise would best benefit me.

But for that I suppose I should see an actual trainer and not look to a video game.

I still stand by my 5 star rating, despite the ignorance abundant in some of the reviews of this game. While Daikatana is no Halflife by any means, it is still one of the of the best games ever made. But I do have some critisms to add since my last review. Two major problems in Daikatana, although the patch eliminates one and greatly reduces the other.  The first thing is as some have stated, the crashes. I have only noticed them in the Norway levels especially around or in the scene with the sorceror in Wynthrax Tower. There has to be a bug in the game at that point because it is a pain getting past the sorceror when the game keeps freezing right after I have beaten him. The other critism is the A.I.  I think the characters and voices are excellent, even if Superfly Johnson is a cheesy name. But the problem lies in not the performance of the A.I.  Now one review said the A.I was horrible which simply isn't true. The A.I is excellent compared to most games, and I didn't notice any enemies standing around, they were all coming straight at me. But the problem with the A.I though is that the game is too dependent on the sidekicks to progress, it gets to be very cumbersome to keep up with them at times and they have the tendency to dissappear and not come back at times. There is a cheat code that allows you to respawn them but it's useless since it always says they are still somewhere in the level when you use it.  But in defense of Mikiko and Superfly they really kick...when they are fighting alongside you and saved me...quite a few times. Overall Daikatana is an excellent game with excellent graphics and a fresh, original, and totally engrossing storyline.  I really really hope there is a sequal.",Excellent Game!,1015286400,5,,

It's my belief and i could be wrong that this is the first microsoft RTS to span the whole epoch of human history. AOE was limited to certain eras starting obviously with ancient civilizations in AOE 1 but empire earth came out with a game that spans them all and that is the main object of this game.

In this game you could literally start at the stone age and advance all the way to the space age. A skirmish can begin in any era you want so C&C fans like me can only play a modern game. I like that.

This has been called the thinking man's RTS but that doesn't mean other great RTS games are mere not sophisticated enough. Most people simply don't have the hours of time available to understand every nuance of a game. Most of the time you just want to play, gather money-resources, build an army and go. This unit counters or is vulnerable that unit. C&C games are that way. I would have never complained that RTS games are not sophisticated enough.

The good thing about RON is that it takes little time and resource to get an army up and rolling. Right away you can make various plants for creating various units. The units themselves look ok but not a sharp and clean as in generals but good. Buildings are the same way. The maps and terrain look fantastic.

Pros:

You can fight in any age.

Great skirmish maps

Full variety of military units available-ground-air-naval

Huge variety of upgrades and technologies.

You can build a sizable military very quickly.

Civ type feature adds another element not found in other RTS.

Cons:

Games take too long, often hard to finish an opponent. Somtimes as little as 30 units and a few defensive structures can hold off an opponent until reinforcements arrive.

Game takes longer to learn than most RTS.

Poor or nonexistent single player campaign

Overall this is a solid RTS and a great value. My second fav RTS to C&C generals and a game i like more than empire earth 2 or warcraft 3. If you take the time to learn it you will get your investment repaid many times over..",Better than empire earth...,1175212800,2,,

But as time has gone on, I have become less and less thrilled with this memory card. Don't get me wrong here folks, it has been a very reliable memory card, and unlike some here who purchased this and got some  other card instead, I did indeed get the one in the picture. But for me the achilles heel of the card is that gosh darn button! Your sitting there on your sofa, very comfortably and you stick a game in your system, all to come to find out you got reach back over again to press a small button on the memory card, because your game saves are on the other page of the card. Personally speaking, it would have been even nicer if the manufacturer could have built this card to be a true 16MB, not 2 8MB's built into one memory card. Again, very reliable, rugged and to this days it works great. But I am no longer going to use it as a primary memory card anymore. I just bought a sweet 64MB's here on Amazon.com and copied all the saves from the 16MB's over to the new card, as well as 5-6 8MB cards, leaving me a total of around 54MB's of data storage space on the new memory card. That is kind of what I wanted with the 16MB card from the get go, the ability to save without the worry or need to change pages within the memory card. So now the 16MB card is my back up copy of what I have on it, for in case the new 64MB card goes out or get's lost, I still have the saves.",Had To Throw In The Towel With This Memory Card,1357171200,,,

*******************************************************************PROS*************************************************************************
Unique FPS gameplay with very unique weapons: This is the best aspect of the game. Weapons are the best aspect of the game. Each weapon comes with primary and secondary fire. They range from rifles that can tag and track the enemies to the ones that can shoot through the walls. Really enjoyable.

Amazing Story/Campaign: I was quite surprised by this. I found story to be interesting in the previous games but this game probably has the best story of all. It is quite personal to the main character and at the same time also ties things to what is happening in the alternate history of the world where alien chimera is taking over the earth.

Strong character portrayal: The voice actors have done amazing job conveying the story. A great incentive to move forward in the game.

Gorgeous graphics and nice music: The best graphics in all of the three games and the music goes well with them. Makes your journey quite enjoyable.

Enemy design: While all of the enemies look like chimeras, there is decent variety of them from small grunts to big chimeras to zombie like chimeras. Makes you think hard about what strategy to use.

Multiplayer: I didn't explore much, but liked what I played.

When I heard a new SimCity was in the works I was thrilled. I immediately pre-ordered then subsequently bought it. Day 1 - 6 I could not log in to play the game due to EA's always-on DRM nonsense. That SHOULD have given me a clue what was to come...

By day 7 I was able to log in and begin playing with two friends of mine. We immediately noticed that when we bought a resource, electricity  for example, it would pay the person who was providing the resource but the person buying it would not have funds deducted. It was like the money was appearing from thin air. This, in our minds, compromised a real ""city simulation."" Strike one...

Traffic, oh sweet mercy, the traffic. Even after multiple attempts at different road layouts and millions sunk into mass transit we could  not prevent traffic from becoming an issue in every one of our cities. A domino effect ensued. Because traffic was bad firetrucks could not reach burning buildings, school buses had trouble picking up kids, garbage trucks couldn't pick up garbage, and so on. Mid to late game all of our cities were in chaos. It felt like an exercise in futility to build a city at all. Strike two...

Somehow, I managed to keep a city alive and well when I played single player. I had maybe logged 10 - 12 hours in this city before I encountered an error so many others have: ""Unable to load the city at this time. Please try again later."" Strike three, I'm out...

One thing that was odd is that she played VP on my pro system and when hooked up to the HDMI at 1080p it looked far superior than any of the old systems that i use to have. Sure they looked great but the new system looked more colorful and vibrant than any i had seen, i work on computers so i read into to things, sometime a little to deep. Well, i noticed when i went to play PURE and RE5 on the arcade version(with my hard drive on it), that on the same TV at 1080p it was fuzzy and the colors didn't look nearly as sharp. First i thought it was just me, or my eyes, well come to find out after reading on a website a LOT of the arcade versions still have the older Falcon chipset in them, even ones made in 09!! It went on to say you may notice a difference on many HDTVs at certain resolutions that pictures may be dull, or colors may look washed out due to this fact.

Unfortunately, it seems this game is not all it's chalked up to be.  Don't get me wrong, this game is great in a lot of ways, it just falls short in many ways.  ill split this into 5 categories.  lets begin with

music:

the score is awesome, and charged with emotion.  it is one of the best soundtracks in a game i have seen, and it rarely breaks from a good flow.  the blu ray tech is well utilized here.  there is even a ""concert hall"" included on the extras on the disc in which you can listen to individual tracks.  a good part of the game.

gameplay:

the gameplay, while fun at times, is quite clunky and useless.  even after applying the patch to use the analog stick for control, it still feels laggy and delayed.  the semi-quicktime battle sequences are cool-looking, but not very well thought-out.  overall, much work could have been done to make this bit better.

story:

sometimes fairly obvious, with the occasional plot twist, it feels as though the story was tacked on.  it doesnt really need to be there, and maybe this game would have been better suited for online or free-roaming play.  it does get interesting at times, but feels very disconnected.  the game creators boast that they have to do more work than movie directors, but in reality this is not the case, and the game rarely impresses.

graphics:

well, it is 2012 now, and the graphics in lair have aged like a glass of milk left out for a week.  looking back, this game was supposed to be a epic showcase of the power of the PS3, and while it does manage to do much more than could ever be imagined on a PS2, it seems the resources of the new playstation are simply stretched too thin to really output amazing graphics.

1080p output? check.  hi-poly dynamic scaling dragon models? check.  breathtaking water and architecture? check.

despite touting all of these features, the game never seems to deliver them all at the same time.  the fact is, choosing to display at 1080p meant sacrificing the rest of the visuals.  dragons look nice close up, but once they fly slightly away from you, the models quickly scale down to super-low-res versions that move slowly and are not at all realistic.  this same principle holds true for all other models in the game, including ships, creatures, buildings, and terrain.  Lair does deliver a huge world with epic battles, but anything not close to you begins to look like a character from a game on NES (very old).  on the flip side, the water still looks amazing, even today.  unfortunately, as you fly closer to it, it never scales up, and it looks horrible.  the same goes for the soldiers on the ground.  whether there are 10 or 1000, they all react exactly the same to your presence, and are basically all little clones of each other.  it is also notable that the game quite often drifts from the target 30 frames per second, and when certain things happen on screen, the game becomes choppy.  it never gets too bad, but it lowers the immersiveness of the whole experience.

maybe if lair was delivered on the PS4, with an overhauled control system and game engine, it would be a 10/10 game.  unfortunately, that is not the case.  As it is, lair is a delicacy that might only be enjoyed by people who truly want to love it.  it is ambitious, and is really the only game that plays like it does.  unfortunately, there are issues that prevent if from being enjoyed by the masses, and so it will always be relegated to being a novelty.  I enjoyed lair, however, and i hope you do too!",A polarizing mixed bag of epic and fail,1344556800,5,,

Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills.

Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle.
The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save.

This game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed.

For classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business. This is the original game plus two bonus missions with two new levels a piece.",Begin The Treasure Hunt!,1391558400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The Bad: Even though there is a variety the core game play doesn't change much, a bit too difficult in spots, way too short

I was really excited about this game because it was the first of its kind, for the Wii, to utilize the Zapper (and any other 3rd party light gun attachments) to make you feel like you're really shooting things. While we can't use the Zapper for RE4 this sure does work. While the game is on rails and it moves around for you it makes a great cinematic experience and the difficulty stays about the same throughout but can sometimes get a bit too tough in spots.

The game has you playing through important sections of previous RE games and it's a great blast to the past. For fans of the series it's wonderful to go back and have certain scenes trigger memories. While the newer RE games aren't present the others are and you can even play sections of the game that you couldn't in the original such as playing as Albert Wesker in RE1. You can upgrade your weapons, shoot objects in the game to find hidden files, and you are rated after each mission.

There are even some sequences where you have to press buttons during key sequences like in RE4. The boss fights are really fun because each one is different and they all have their own way of having to be beat. The controls are pretty simple and easy (especially on the Zapper). There are plenty of enemy types, weapons and so forth to use.

I find that REUC is one of the best arcade style games on the Wii and shouldn't be passed up. The game is short mind you and isn't worth nearly $50 but as soon as the price drops it'll be a steal.",One of the best shooters on the Wii,1332979200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It has a decent selection of games but most of them lean toward younger children, that is the way Nintedo has always been and will always be, but that's great for the kids. If you're a bit older, and looking for some mature games that aren't geared torward the pre-10 year old crowd, the system has a few but very little in that category, maybe a handful or more. GC lacks heavy 3rd party support and the little it does have, make a few mature titles but are usually quick cash ins with little substance. But there are a couple good ones to be found, just very miniscule compared to the other consoles on the market.
The system itself is very small, and that's great for fitting it in tight spaces. Very durable as well. The system doesn't play DVD movies or music CD's though, just a special mini disc that play the games for the system. If you want a game console that plays games, DVD's and CD's, then this isn't what you're looking for, you'd be better with a PS 2 in that case.
The gamepad is great though. Very comfortable but the button layout is a bit akward for certain games, but overall it's good. It also has 4 gamepad ports so 4 player games are definitely fun. But it does not include a modem, harddrive and the memory cards have very little save space that get filled up quickley with certain games, so expect to buy many memory cards down the road.
The graphics and sound are also impressive, and most games have very fast load times. The system does not have an optical(toslink) output like the PS 2 does, but it is capable of prologicII whch sounds great, although not quite as nice as DTS/5.1.
Overall, a nice system, but limited in terms of features such as DVD, CD, and 5.1 playback and also very limited in variety of games, and mostly geared toward children. It also does not have an online structure, so you will not be playing games online for quite awhile if at all.

It comes with two AA Alkaline batteries.(At least mine did.)  Personally, I did buy the ""Plug N' Play"" rechargeable battery pack with the cord to plug it in when it needs chargeing; however, I now use rechargeable batteries instead.

I felt their official battery pack needed to be charged too often.  So I went with my preffered brand of rechargeable batteries and I've never looked back.  Just in case you're wondering what I decided to use, I use Rayovac 15 minute rechargeables.  I keep an extra pair of regular Alkaline AA batteries for when I need to charge them.  Still have the original pair of Alkaline AAs that I started with too. ;P

PROS:

1.  It's wireless.

2.  Can easily last up to 20 hours before needing a new pair of batteries.

3.  You can walk around and get something from the fridge without setting down the controller so you can also continue talking to friends if you're online.

CONS:

1.  The batteries lasting up to 20 hours really only happens if you don't have anything like the headset plugged in.  The headset really drains it alot more.  Who knows how much the QWERTY keyboard add-on will drain!

2.  You can NOT use it on your computer as there is no USB cable to connect it with.

3.  Like all controllers in existence, it gets dirt in the groves that should be periodically cleaned out.

P.S. Just search for ""Rayovac 15 minute"" if you wanna find the same AA batteries I use and the charger.  You'll save ALOT of money overall!  Not to mention, as a side benefit, if you care about the enviroment you're helping it since it's that many fewer alkaline batteries in the dump. ;P",Pretty Good!,1180483200,,,

I got sucked in. I couldn't help it. I couldn't put it down. It had so much nostalgia in it I didn't even know where to start.  It reminded me of the classics essentials of the Square Soft JRPG.

Yes, there are grinding.  Yes, there are challenging bosses, and yes, there are awesome rewards.
On the high level, ""Brave"" and ""Default"" are just ways to spend and accumulate ""action points"" in battle.  This ""action point"" system isn't new, as other JRPG's have had it before, but this game is able to make battle system so fluid it is eye-opening and refreshing.

+ Likeable characters!
+ Deeply customizable battles!
+ Rewarding battle reward system!
+ Play with your left hand!
+ Job system!
+ Lovely hand-drawn environment!
+ Remarkable sound track!
-

There are so many great things about this game besides the ""Bravely"" and ""Default"" --
+ Characters are so likeable!  Each is unique with great and rich personality. I love how the main characters interact with each other as well as every secondary characters. Whenever the old hermit pops into the story, I laugh with joy. :)

+ Deeply customizable battles!  If you don't want random encounters, set the encounter rate to -100% to turn them off completely!  If you like challenges, set to Hard difficulty to fight enemies with tons of HP.  Press Y to enable auto-battle so the last set of commands get repeated.  Press Right on the D-Pad to speed up the battle speed (up to 200%+ speed) so grinding is a lot more likeable!  There is even an accessory that helps if you want even higher random encounter rate.  As a matter of fact, I have been proudly playing with +100% encounter rate on Hard since the first minute. For a good duration of the game, I have been wearing the +100% encounter rate accessory for a brutal +200% encounter rate Hard difficulty battles.  It was fun and rewarding but it was brutal... 1 encounter every 3 steps was a little too much. :)

+ Rewarding battle reward system! Defeat all enemies in a single turn for a reward boost. Defeat all enemies without taking damage for another reward boost. Wipe all enemies with 1 shot (usually magic) for yet a different reward boost.  Getting the same reward boots after 5 battles and the reward goes to 10% to 20%. Getting them 10 in a row boosts the rewards to 50%!  Now you see why I had been playing with the +100% to +200% encounter rate... ;-)

+ Play with your left hand!  Left on the D-Pad to cancel (replaces A button), Right on the D-Pad to confirm (replaces B button), configure L and R buttons to quickly issue Brave or Default commands in battle.  I have had the chance to enjoy a great number of JRPGs but I have yet to find one so thoughtfully laying out the control for you so you get to free your right hand during gaming.

+ Job system! For those who have played Final Fantasy Tactics, you must experience this game! It's a joy that you can change jobs freely to receive all sorts of stat boosts. Level up each job to unlock abilities so you get to mix-and-match those with other jobs.

+ Hand-drawn lovely environments and details! One of the most notable things about the environment is details -- when you first stepped out of the starting inn and stood for two seconds, the camera zoomed all the way out to the entire city and you felt the grand scale and the vision the game sets you up for.  As you walk, you see citizens as well as small critters scattered around the city. They may not be doing much, but you feel immersed and you feel ""real"". :)

+ Remarkable sound track!  Whether you are strolling under the sun in a small city or in the heated boss fight, the sound track is just right.

+ Play in Japanese!  My game was bought in US but it allowed me to play in Japanese voice with Japanese text! I was thrilled to have this as an option!

There are a few things I don't quite like, such as some portionf of the story and how some of the side quests are overly long while others are surprisingly short.  Over all I am thoroughly enjoying it, and just now taking a short break to reflect and write this review (hopefully I could get more poeple to enjoy this great game after seeing all these positive reviews).

I really like the story line, it seems to be the story of alot of people in those days. Vito grows up in hard times with his friend Joe, starting a life of crime that gets cut short after being busted for theft. He makes a choice to go to war over prison. Vito takes a shot, comes home, and picks up where he left off in his life of crime. Mobsters, cars, big cash and loose women provide all he wants. For now anyway.

One little trick I learned on youtube that some kid posted. Not really a SPOILER,but some might think so.
After doing your first job, you can go back to the scapyard to crush up cars for fast bucks! There are always two cars parked near the crusher. After you crush the two cars, run past the shack and 2 wooden  horses, down the lane until you past the long brown box on the left. Then run back toward the crusher and 2 more cars will be there! You keep doing that until the crusher jams shut. You can drive off the yard and drive up the street, then go back and the crusher is open again. You get over $400 a car.","Liked it alot, didn't fall in love with this one!",1291248000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

You have to think like a thief in this game to have any chance of surviving. Your  supply of weapons is definitely NOT for head on confrontations. There is  something very satisfying about sneaking up on someone and simply knocking  them over the head with your blackjack. Who would think that not  splattering someone all over a wall(like every other FPS out there)would be  so fun? But it is. The only real flaws of this game is the AI and some of  the enemies that you have to face. First, the AI is fine most of the time,  but can be very quirky at times, such as not noticing you when you are  making enough noise to annoy a jackhammer operator or noticing you when you  are silent and still in complete darkness. The other flaw is that in a few  levels you have to deal with creatures that can see you in the dark and  also can't be knocked out. This is annoying because the greatness of this  game comes from sneaking around. This seems to be a common complaint and  has been addressed in the sequel.

Currently I've been waiting 3 days for them to call me since they've escalated my issue to tier 2 because they don't know how to fix my issues.

Issue #1  Firmware doesn't work.  Keeps telling me No Razer Naga Epic connected, and closes on me.
Tech support doesn't know how to fix, still waiting on tier 2 to call me as they claim they would to resolve my issue.

Issue #2  If I ever use it wireless, it randomly stops working.  It takes about 5 minutes to start working on it's own, or if I connect it to the usb cable it takes a minute to connect IF that worked, sometimes that doesn't work and I have to disconnect it and reconnect it again.

 I've gone over this with tech support, and according to them there is no reason this should be happening, there's no issues they see with my computer.  I'm frustrated, and tired of waiting for them to contact me on an issue that they should have contacted me back on within one day.
I will give it 2 more days and if not contacted back by then, I will be returning it and not getting another one.

I love razer, but maybe it's time I start looking into another brand.

@Razer support, before you give me your copy and paste ""please contact us"" You should read my issue and see that I already have contacted Razer support, they've escalated my issue and I've been waiting.

Edit:
So it turns out I will not be changing my 1 star rating on this item.
Razer Support promised me tier 2 will be giving me a call a few days ago, and instead of a phone call I receive an email saying I should contact Amazon Support and request a refund.  This is the 2nd non-functioning razer mouse I've received, and being told by a company that you should ask for a refund instead of them trying to keep your business or offer any troubleshooting steps is extremely frustrating.

The battery life is respectable, the unit is of passable build quality, and the reception range and signal reliability are impressive.  All this with a built-in touchpad.

You may ask why did I choose a PS3 keyboard for a PC?
- Bluetooth keyboards on PC's are rather expensive and more so when you are looking for a built-in touchpad.
- Few choices of products when searching for keyboard+touchpad combos
- Logitech makes the DiNovo Mini and Edge but these are rather expensive - and they have their issues.
- Wireless keyboard/mouse combos (non-Bluetooth) are notoriously short on reception range and unreliable (missed keystrokes)

The PS3 keyboard is fully functional with a PC and half the price of other alternatives (that are of unknown vendors and trash quality)

The highlights of the keyboard are:
- Value (contrasted to similar Bluetooth keyboard + touchpad sets)
- Bluetooth support (range, reliability)
- Touchpad (same as a laptop touchpad)
- Keyboard-based left and right mouse buttons on both sides of the keyboard (perfect for true ""laptop"" use)
- Touchpad-based scrolling
- Lightweight
- Acceptable build quality
- Acceptable battery life
- Software support is absolutely basic (No bloatware, Windows 7 does support this product)

The cons:
- Designed for a PS3 (No windows key but you can just use Ctrl+Esc)
- No backlighting (for use in low-light)
- Gloss plastic (fingerprints)
- Software support is absolutely basic (Might be an issue for some)
- Unknown if it can survive a drop to a hardwood floor (and I'm not going to test this out)
- Unit does not appear to shut off automatically
- Weak documentation (use standard Bluetooth procedures to install the unit)

5.0,False,"12 11, 2010",A3OOIS6U00QJJX,B000UU3SVI,Dev,"I knew little about the fallout series before I played this game. Since Fallout series was popular and this game received great reviews , I decided to give it a shot. After finishing it (60+ hrs w/o DLCs; 80+ hrs with all 5 DLCs), here is what I thought.

**********PROS.**********

LONG, JUST VERY LONG AND ENTERTAINING RPG: These days when most of the games (even RPGs) are 10hrs, it was a rejuvenating experience to play this long RPG. Just like other RPGs and games in general, while some elements were redundant, it has plenty of variety to offer as you progress in the game. Even after playing 50+ hrs (not even touching the awesome DLCs), there were always exciting and unexpected events in the game. Great job Bathesda, great job.

CHOICES, CHOICES, CHOICES: In this game, just like Mass Effect and Bioshock, you will have to make choices, lots and lots of them. And each choice you make will have major consequence on the outcome your missions and game all together. Again wonderful job. There will be time you will make a choice, finish the mission,  get the results and out of curiosity replay the same mission again (assuming you saved before the mission), to see what outcome you might have gotten if you were to make a different choice.

KARMA METER: The choices you make will give you extremely positive to extremely negative karma. And different karma will change behavior of people of wasteland towards you allowing you to do different missions, unlock different achievements and different rewards. Depending on the choices you make, you will turn certain groups into your friends and others into enemies. Words simply can't describe the experience. You have to play it get the feel for what I am saying.

OPEN WORLD: Yes you are free to roam in wasteland and go wherever you want to go. I personally loved it. While to progress in the story you have to go to specific places on the map. You can take whatever route you can take and complete whichever missions you like.

SURPRISES WHILE ROAMING IN OPEN WORLD: This was one of the strongest aspect of the game. While roaming in open world and exploring new areas and wastleland towns, you never know what you are going to encounter. While a lot of open world games have the same type of enemies and areas in open world, this game will introduce to plenty of varieties. Can't tell more without spoiling.

RPG ELEMENT: As you defeat enemies, complete missions, solve conflicts and progress through game, you gain experience and level up. Leveling up will allow you to enhance your traits and unique abilities (for example, your aiming, your melee power, unique abilities like  your conversation skills, atomic explosion when you are damaged enough etc.)

COMBAT MECHANICS: The game is First Person Shooter for most part, but it has unique combat mechanic.  While playing FPS, you can freeze time so do speak and target specific enemies part for higher damage of decapitate them. This can make game very strategic as some enemies faster or bigger than others and sometime enemies can have devastating weapons. So if you use this time freezing and aiming trait well you can target specific body parts or their weapons and slow them down.

VARIETY IN ENEMIES: A lot of long games becoming boring in short time as they have the same enemies over and over again. But that is not the case for this game. As you explore the wastleland, you will come across plenty of different enemies ranging from thugs and little creatures to heavily armored soldiers and super mutants. LOVED IT JUST LOVED IT.

DECENT STORY: While it is not the strongest aspect of the game, it does have decent story with somewhat of a suspense and oh depending on the choices you make, story and ending changes.

DIALOGUE TREE AND GOOD VOICE ACTING: If you played Mass Effect than you know what I am referring to. While talking to different characters, you can choose what you want to tell them. You can be charismatic and friendly or you can be rude. You choose. Again what you choose affects the end result of the game. To me what was nice was these dialogue were well designed and voice acting of hundreds of people you talk to was much better than what I expected. This truly makes gaming experience more rewarding.

(IF YOU HAVE GOTY)

FIVE DLCS = 10+ MORE HOURS OF GAMEPLAY: The five DLCs will add to the main story of the game, but in addition it will take to you to a hidden slave town, alient space ship, pre-nuclear explosion war era and on a mystic island. I loved all five of them especially the island and story+ dlcs.

INCREASE LEVEL CAP TO 30. If you don't have these dlcs, you can level up only to lv 20, but if you have these dlcs you can level up all the way up to lv 30. That means more traits, more choices and more unique powers.

******************CONS******************

GLITCHES: This is simply unacceptable. There are glitches in the game that can make you go crazy. For example for me I completed a mission and I didn't get achievement unlocked for that particular mission. Fortunately for 360 version a lot of these are fixed by patches. Nevertheless you will still encounter some.

LEVEL CAP: I also didn't like you can only level up 20 or 30 depending on which version you have. I wish they would at least let you level up to lv 50 and get all the traits possible.

****************CONCLUSION*****************

I truly wish they would have worked hard to fix the glitches, but contrary to those glitches this game has a lot to offer. 80+ hr of gameplay paid me back every single cent I spent to buy this game. I highly recommend this game to RPG and FPS lovers. If you can get GOTY (9.5/10), if not then at least give normal edition a shot (9/10).",LONG LONG ENTERTAINING RPG,1292025600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Unfortunately that's all there is too her. I was the first to get her and I wanted so badly to like her but she has too many flaws. Pokmon players will understand when I say that she's like the Magikarp of the Skylander world, she's wimpy and a pain to level

Her defenses are what literally slay her, she has bad defenses, very weak, her bone fence will get taken out by tankier enemies easily and she dies quickly in a mob of anything but the weakest of enemies. If you decide to get her and play with her then get her hats and charms to ramp up her defenses or you will die a lot.

Her attack isn't much better, you have to power up her skull rain attack and while she's not the only Skylander who does this, she gets her attacks off slowly even with upgrades and there's a delay between when you push the attack button and when she launches her attack and it only takes an enemy bumping into you to disrupt it, her accuracy and critical hit is cruddy.

She's not a slow character when it comes to just moving around

Upgrades, hats and charms don't help her much and it's difficult to try to boost her stats in Cali's Challenges, Brock's Arena Challenges and I wouldn't recommend her in PvP mode.

I got rid of my Hex because I was just frustrated and disappointed and while the character mold looks good her arms are prone to ripping if your not careful. I had to have mine glued because her rubbery, thin arm got a tear in it.

 Trust me, there are better Skylanders to get for your money. If you want an Undead Skylander girl that can help you win the game, you'd be better off with Cynder or Roller Brawl.

If I didn't get them all, feel free to add! Remember, I only listed the MAIN classes, not the special ones.

The gameplay is a very strong point in the game. You fight monsters, humans or a mixture of both on a field of squares that you move from one to the next. It's somewhat time consuming going through the menus to battle, but really, if you're into strategy RPGs, you're used to this. I will mention one thing: I've found myself falling asleep to this game because the battles were slow. Not that this should detract you from buying this excellent game.

The story is seriously the strongest point in the game. You are in a huge place called Ivalice and you travel from town to town occasional going to waterfalls or swamps and what not. Ramza is the main character and he experiences betrayal, meeting new friends and fighting for what's right.

The sound isn't bad. The main music in battles against monsters (which can happen in between towns on the map) is OK, but you might get sick of it after a while. But some of it is pretty good. Not great, but good. Just don't expect it to blow you away.

I think I've touched on the main points. Once again, if I'm missing a class, feel free to tell me.

This is *NEW* and improved PX4 VERSION 2 (TBS-3276-011) which comes with 'PS4 Talkback' cable.

What's included? - 5 Stars!
The PX4 Premium wireless gaming headset comes with impressive array of essential accessories - So what's included? - The PX4 Headset, PX4 Wireless Transmitter, Detachable Boom Microphone, 'PS4 Talkback' cable, Xbox 360 Talkback Cable, Digital Optical Cable, Headset Charging Cable.

How does it work? - 4  stars!
The Ear Force PX4 is a premium, Dolby surround sound headset designed for PS3, PS4 and Xbox360 gaming plus works with your regular analog devices like MP3 players and Smartphones via Analog. The included `PX4 transmitter' processes Dolby Digital surround sound from your PS3, PS4 or Xbox360 and sends it to the headset via dedicated `digital RF'. The result is an immersive wireless sound environment that makes you feel as if you're right in the middle of the action. It also helps you react quicker during a gaming session by hearing exactly where the sound cues in the game are coming from. Unlike the regular `RF technology' used in most other wireless headsets, the dual-band Wi-Fi technology found in the PX4 can coexists with other wireless networks for optimum performance.

Apart from the Dual-Band the PX4 also incorporates Bluetooth technology which can be used to simultaneously pair to two Bluetooth-enabled devices at once. For example, you can pair the PX4 headset to your PS3 gaming console and your mobile phone at the same time. This allows you to use your headset to accept phone calls all while totally immersed in the action of the game. The Bluetooth connection only allows phone audio, Media audio profile is not available for Bluetooth connections.

How does it sound? - 4 stars!
The Ear Force PX4 is a good sounding headset for the price. While you cannot compare this with some high end headsets exclusively used for listening to music audio this is purely for gaming and yet remain connected with friends and family by enabling you to take incoming calls from your smartphone without getting off the gaming couch. There is a bit of hissing sound even when you keep the volume very low but not too distracting when the action begins. Incoming phone calls can be answered and the attached Microphone works well.

How good is battery life? - 5 stars!
The Ear Force PX4 also comes with a rechargeable lithium polymer battery that provides up to 15 hours of continuous game play on a single charge. The battery can also be recharged while gaming with the included long USB based charging cable so you'll never miss out on the action even when you are charging the Ear Force PX4.

How comfortable is it? - 3  stars!
Please bear in mind that this not too lightweight when compared to other basic headsets but the soft fabric cushions does help in minimizing the pressure on your ears for extended game-play. Most of these over the ear headphones do take few weeks to break-in and start feeling comfortable. I have had these only for few days but the initial impression was better than average. It does make clacking sounds when buttons are pressed since they are plastic. It does take some time to get used to the array of buttons and analog rotary controls.

Bottom-line: 4 stars!
The PX4 Premium wireless gaming headset comes with impressive array of essential accessories to hook up to most popular gaming consoles. Sounds good and works well to immerse you into the gaming environment. Total Wireless chat is available on PS3 gaming console only. Included talkback cables are required between headset and PS4 controller. Wireless chat on Xbox360 requires XBA adapter, which needs to be purchased separately. The inability to have `media profile' via Bluetooth for smartphones music playback combined with some minor cons mentioned above forced me to rate this with 4 respectable stars!",Broader compatible Gaming Headset!,1412380800,,,

Also, the volume seems to be REALLY loud. Even turning the windows volume down to 1 out of 100 manually, and also changing the virtual speaker distance to make them further away, these things are still too loud!

Finally, the microphone is too soft. The boom can swing up and hide in the frame, which is cool, but when you swing it down to use it, you can't move it closer to your face.

I think the game improves on some of 2s flaws (if you played the Marvel Lego Super Heroes, youll know some of these improvements). Basically, being able to move when people are changing characters is nice. Also, changing suits in this game is a hundred times better than in part 2. In the old game, free play got frustrating because suit changing stations didn't exist in every section. Worse, sometimes the electrical suit would lose its charge, requiring us to start over. Not an issue here.

There are bugs, as usual, and 2 crashes in the first 3 hours of playing. Not sure what to blame, but at least the game saves automatically and puts you back where you were when you restart (unlike in part 2 where you had to remember where you were exactly and you better hope the game doesnt autosave before you get there...)

3.0,False,"05 28, 2013",A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B000296DZ0,Elias,"The ""Terminator"" franchise doesn't need an introduction, but for clarity's sake, I'll give it one. Four films, all excellent in their own right, tell the story of a doomed Earth taken over by machines, and a group of rebels using time-travel to go back to the past and avert the mistakes which led to the chaotic apocalypse in which they live. With the exception of the most recent film, the series stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a Terminator, a morally ambiguous death machine. Highlights of the franchise include large-scale futuristic wars, thrilling contemporary vehicle chases, and a surprisingly cerebral story arc. Ah, yes, and explosions. Lots and lots of beautiful explosions.

This sounds like it would make for a great line of video games, and many people have certainly tried to make some of the series. But the path to hell is paved with good intentions, and ""hell"" would be an apt word to describe most of the ""Terminator"" games. At best, horribly designed and offensively hackneyed, and at worst, buggy and incomplete, nobody has really captured the spirit of what makes the series so timeless. However, in 2004, one developer came close to actually getting it with ""Terminator 3: The Redemption.""

The plot retells the events of the T3 film, with a prequel and epilogue setting up the backstory of AH-NULD's iconic cybernetic deathbringer. It's... well, honestly, it's not that interesting. It plays out like a decent fan-fiction for the original parts, then like a Hit Clips version of the film when retelling T3's events. The new cutscenes are certainly cool to look at, and have some really great setpieces, but the story they tell is incredibly uninteresting. For hardcore fans like me, it's an interesting concept, but done pretty shoddily; for everybody else, it's probably just dull and uninspired.

What it lacks in substance, though, it makes up for in excitement. The gameplay is actually some of the best in a licensed game, and works pretty smoothly. You've got elements of a third-person shooter, brawler, and driving game rolled into one experience, which is exactly how a ""Terminator"" game should be. But not all of them work very well. The worst aspect, by far, are the brawler mechanics. Sluggish, repetitive, and needlessly elaborate (seriously, how many different ways do you expect me to mash the same two buttons?!), they seem like an afterthought. In the middle of the road, we have the shooting mechanics. They're pretty rudimentary and clumsy, but definitely functional; it's pretty satisfying to mow through opponents while dual-wielding assault rifles, after all, so it's forgivable if the combat itself is nothing special.

Where this game truly excels, though, are the driving sequences. Without fail, each one is incredibly exhilarating, and feature unique mechanics with each mission. It has one of the earliest usages of car-to-car hijacking (later seen in the ""Just Cause"" games), some great arcade-style controls that blend seamlessly with shooting, and a wide variety of backdrops in which chases take place. To top it off, some of the set pieces are simply some of the coolest I've experienced in a game. When's the last time you've jumped a pick-up truck off a cliff, then ziplined on a power line while holding the truck with your other arm across a valley? That, and more, occurs in this game. Honestly, if this game were nothing but driving, it would probably bump up my score a bit.

In the visual department, the game is a toss-up. The graphics are decent, and have a good amount of variety to them, especially in the driving portions. It's also cool to see Ahnuld deteriorate as he takes damage, which was a really nice touch. However, the futuristic portions of the game are really bland, and look like every other grey-and-black shooter out there. Also disappointing is the usage of footage from the movie when Ahnuld arrives in the present day, which just comes across as cheap and lazy.

And in the audio department, things just as mixed. Voice acting is pretty atrocious, in my opinion, even the halfway decent Ahnuld impersonator. Sound effects are weak and unsatisfying, offering no visceral punch for explosions and gunfights, which is sort of a hallmark of the franchise. The one redemption (ba-dum-tss) here is the soundtrack, which is exciting and provides some nice background noise for the on-screen action. I would even recommend muting the audio and just listening to the score; you wouldn't be missing much.

When all is said and done, I feel we're left with the best ""Terminator"" game available (that I've played, at least.) That being said, since virtually all of the other games are steaming piles, that's not really saying much. There are definitely some hints of brilliance in this game, but it needed a lot more development time before release; if it had been given that time, then we might have had one of the best actioners of the last generation. But as it stands now, ""Terminator 3: The Redemption"" is a fun little game that is wholly inoffensive, but definitely limited by technical issues that hold it back from true greatness.

The roster was not updated, so its still the roster from late 2001. There is no story mode (Road to Wrestlemania), instead there are championship modes where you need to go through 12 wrestlers to get a title shot. The Raw arena is the ONLY arena and there are no backstage areas. Nor is there any real hardcore action, because even though there are 100s of weapons, these weapons are helmets, tables, jack-o-lanterns, chairs, bandanas and so on. The wrestlers do not bleed at all, not even with a code! There is a pretty deep create-a-wrestler feature, however you can only create 16 wrestlers even though this is a PC game! There is no RVD, Mysterio, Booker T and so on, however there is Rhyno, Spike, X-Pac, Credible and Haku. There are very few modes, exhibition and the king of the ring tournament. There are no table matches, ironman matches, or 6 man tag matches (even though the game lets 6 wrestlers in the ring at the same time). At least all of the titles are in the game that were in the WWF in 2001, Hardcore, Heavyweight, Light-Heavyweight, European, Women's, and Intercontinental. The play is very unbalanced, such as the Rock and the Undertaker can undoubtedly beat up K-Kwik and Taka, so there is no chance raising a new star! Another detail to the game is the new stamina bar, where your wrestler will get *winded* the more he runs and does power moves. So Rhyno cannot do gore after gore, because he would get tired. With there being a stamina bar, there is also a *voltage* bar, which is basically one long bar that determines who is winning and when you can do finishing maneuvers. The controls are unique, where you have an attack, grapple, block and action button. The attack button is capable of several attacks, such as hold up and press the attack button will do a dropkick, hold down and press the attack it will be a kick or a punch. It?s the same with the grapple button. The action button can do anything from perform a taunt, pin an opponent, pick up weapons, put on clothes and climb the turnbuckle.

1.0,False,"08 15, 2010",A21XZF5ZHKK5EM,B00006F2ZP,Antoinette Johnson,"I love the Spyro series. My favorite was Spyro Year of the Dragon which was perfect. When I heard Spyro was gonna be on next gen systems I was excited! Boy...I did not espect them to butcher the series for me. For one this game was not made by Insomniac games who are responsible for making the first 3 kickass games. That was my first sign this probably wasn't gonna be as good as I want it to be. (May contain spoilers)

Story: This entire story is a plot hole. In the 2nd Spyro Ripto was the main villian and you kill him at the end. This game gives no explanation on how the hell he returns. I understand the Dragonfly plot, but Riptos return is just crazy.

Graphics: Even though the graphics looked pretty good, I found lots of graphical glitches. For one the game lags alot. Before trading my copy I had a glitch where the all the sheep in the game front leg stretched into the sky. I restarted my console, but the glitch remained. It wouldn't go away. I also noticed the character designs seemed a little distorted at time. In the honey world theres a graphical glitch where all the honey stops flowing too. Damn! Did they have any quality assurance?

Gameplay: The gameplay works the same as the first 3 games, but new firebreathing techniques are added. I found lots of trouble wuth the bubble breath. I would be chasing a dragonfly and I will clearly be hitting it with the bubblebreath, but he won't be caught. That is a huge pain in the ass later on when you have to chase them annoying things on platforms and are faster. Once again theres lag. Lagging is a huge issue in this game because it happens often and slow gameplay. theres also this funny ass glitch where you swim un the air. In the homeworld just swim to the edge of the water at the Beach world entrance. Do a headslam and hold square when you do it and start swimming in the air like its water. You can go all over the place with it. This prooves they didn't test the game before releasing it. I also had trouble figuring out what to do after fighting Ripto. I got no ending or nothing, so I tried collecting everything. It was impossible. I needed one gem and it was in the Thieves den. I spent days looking for it even using Sparks to help, but it never showed up. In the dragon dojo there was a glitch that happens when you try to get the kites for the baby dragons. IIf you jump in the right spot around the kite trees, the game will make the mistake of thinking you touched the kite and give it to the baby. Removing any strategy involved with getting it the normal way.

Sound: One of the highlights of Spyro games was always the sound and music. The music wasn't too bad. Its definately not the usual Spyro formula, but it wasn't too bad. I notived alot of the music consisted of what sounds to me like Indian chants. My favorite tracks were in the Thieves Den level. The music is kind of boring though. Its lacks the intensity and fun of the older games. Sadly even the sound has glitches. sometimes the music and sounds skip. In the Dragon Dojo the sound of the enemies attacking skipped the entire time I was in the level and wouldn't go away until I left.

Lengh: This game is short. I MEAN short. Its only one world! I mean WTF! Spyro the dragon had 5 worlds including a bonus, Riptos Rage had 3 including an bonus, and Year of the dragon had 4 including many extras. This has one world with 7 or 8 short levels! From my knowledge theres not even a bonus for getting all coins and dragonflies. You don't get all your money from Moneybags the bear, theres no extra powers, nosatisfying cutscene, or any reason to try and complete the levels 100%. As mention earlier nothing happened when I defeated Ripto so I know this because of a LP I saw on Youtube.

 In short Spyro Enter the Dragonfly was a huge disappointment. This game could have been good if put in the right hands. I would love to see it remade with all these problems taken care of, but given the bad recession this series has had lately, I don't see that happening anytime soon.",The glinchiest game I've ever played.,1281830400,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 2'},
3.0,True,"02 11, 2015",A1MJS1YRKNMU04,B0050SY8UK,Grrgoyl,"Me:  Not an ""avid gamer,"" which I consider anyone who spends hours and hours and hours playing games (not judging, just not me).  I've never played Fable before so I had zero expectations.  And I love Kinect (which apparently sets me apart from the majority of Xbox users).

I asked for this game for Christmas, and then put off playing it for a month because I was afraid it would be an epic saga that would take up all my time.  Yes and no; there are ample save spots (like every five minutes at least), so you can play for fifteen minutes or two hours, it's up to you.  I think that's fantastic since I never know how long I'll have to play or how quickly my attention will wander.  (And the story is engaging enough that you DO want to keep playing to see what the next challenge will be.)

Yes, it's on rails.  I can see where it might be better if you could roam freely (like Rise of Nightmares), but my problem with video games is I don't play enough of them that if I come up against a really difficult puzzle, I can only devote so much energy to solving it before I get bored and the game gets shoved to the back of the shelf, probably never to be played again.  This game guides you through and makes your goals fairly self-explanatory (probably way too easy for people who like puzzle solving).  This allows you to focus on the more enjoyable aspect of fighting with magic.

Magic.  It is SO MUCH FUN to blast your enemies with just your hands, hurling either energy balls or magic ropes to stun them or pull their shields away and then blast them.  The targeting isn't always terribly precise, but you can at least use both hands simultaneously, dispatching monsters left and right continuously (and if you keep missing, they eventually end up right in front of you where you can hit them very easily).  This goes a long way towards helping me forgive the on rails part, because I have enough to think about without worrying what my feet are doing too (although you can slide right and left to duck for cover or avoid missiles).  And I haven't died yet, even against ""bosses,"" which are not too easy or too hard (edit:  I died twice last night against mini-bosses, and sure enough, the save spot brought me immediately back to the beginning of the fight.  So no tedious re-covering of ground again).  This makes me think the game might be excellent for kids of a certain age who might not be ready for really hard monsters yet.

I'm also thankful you can sit while playing, because all the hurling I just described provides a really tough workout for the arms and shoulders, enough that I welcome the quiet interludes after battles of just steering the horse.

I don't know how far along I am, but I'm already sad about finishing the game and hoping the arcade option creates sufficient replayability (I'll update when I get to that point).

All in all I'm very pleasantly surprised by this game--especially at the super low price it's available for, this is absolutely worth trying out.  Maybe more people would like Kinect if they started with this one.

EDIT:  I finished the game last night, which astonished me; as I said above, I've never finished any games of this type before.  Which I felt a little proud of, except for the fact that the final ""boss"" is nothing of the sort (SPOILERS):  you basically fight off hordes of the same easy to kill creatures you've been fighting all along, while your companion Theresa handles the big bad.  I've never finished a game like this before, and even I think this was pretty lame.

As for replayability, I'm skeptical of this too.  I tried one level in arcade mode, and it was essentially just replaying that one short segment of the game.  I can't imagine this will hold my attention for long.

I'm glad I played it though.  Looking at it as a whole, I again think this would be excellent for younger kids who might be easily discouraged from more difficult games like this, as once you get the hang of the magic the play is pretty similar throughout.  There is also no nudity or gratuitous gore, which apparently is becoming harder to find in games.",Much More Fun Than Expected,1423612800,,,

They are already broken. The cord that goes into the left earphone and also has the little box on it where you can control volume and so on. Well, that cord if is shorting out. When it moves around naturally while playing games or doing anything on the computer it creates a static sound and the volume of what I am listening too goes low, if I shake the cord a little it fixes it, but then when I release it it messes up again. The cords own weight seems to cause this as you move around and pick up and let go of the cord when adjust volume or muting the mic.

The software has lots of features including a nice voice changer that is hilarious, but its also clunky and a pain when you want to do simple adjustments. The mic seems to be OK, but not great on this as well. Its removable, so maybe that causes some problems as its a plug in mic, not built into the unit.

ORIGINAL REVIEW from DAY 1-2-3 of use: So far they have great sound and a great mic as well. Comfort is also very nice. The software that comes with it is very good, allows you to change your voice for some fun and many other features to adjust the quality of the sound for gaming and music. Nice 7.1 surround features that actually work in games too. The ear cushions are thick and very soft and cover the whole ear nicely. Only have had them 1 week so not sure how long they will hold up, but much of it is made of steel/metal parts and feels top notch, I am very satisfied so far.

EDIT CONCLUSION:  I NO LONGER recommend this headset as the best bang for your buck. It does everything well at first. It seemed to have Beat all of my plantronics, razer, sades and other headsets by a longshot the first week or two as it worked fine, but the build quality, mic and software have me rating this very low. I paid $130 for this and it lasted about 35 days, that is terrible. My Sades for $29 lasted about 6 months before the plastic earcup gave out. I expected to have this set for a year or years to come, but now I am returning it and will not re-visit creative again for hardware such as this.","High quality sound, comfort, build and Mic, the best bang for your buck.",1483315200,2,{'Style:': ' Professional 7.1 Surround Gaming Headset'},

In addition to the trusty tools I mentioned above, you get a whole slew of other gadgets you can use to capture the monkeys, including an r/c car, slingshot and monkey radar. Unfortunately, the monkeys are also armed with everything from grenades to machine guns to canons.

4.0,False,"03 3, 2011",A2901YDXL5PC35,B004774IPU,Jonathon,"Before I bought the game, I was shocked to come on here and find that Civ V rated an average of 2.5 stars.  The game had been well reviewed by critics, was part of a long line of amazing games, and had supposedly made some great changes to the formula to start fresh with things like hex tiles and non-stacking units.  I had been excited about the game, but then almost considered not getting it.

Having broken down and purchased the game, and played it for a solid month now, I can tell you that a lot of the poor reviews are way off-base.  There was a lot of expectation for this game, because Civ IV had been such a masterpiece, and the initial release of this game was horribly buggy and imbalanced.  It has been regularly patched since then, however, and in fact was just patched on March 1st.  In it's current state, the game no longer crashes frequently (I have actually never experienced a single crash on my modest laptop, and I run that game at max settings), the in-between turn times are now minimal, and overall the game has been much more balanced to allow Domination, Cultural, or Scientific victories (Diplomatic victories are still kind of dumb... you may want to disable them).

So that negates a lot of the issues that people had with this game when giving it negative reviews.  Another that I have seen: Civ V can only be played online!  This is flat out not true.  You need to be online to download Steam if you don't have it, and then to download and install the game.  Then you can simply set Steam to work in offline mode and play the game regardless of if you have an internet connection.  Another gripe: you can't skip the opening cinematic!  Again, not true.  The cinematic masks a loading screen.  Hit space bar or escape as soon as you see the cinematic.  As soon as the game finishes loading, the cinematic will cut off and you'll reach the menu.

So I've spent a lot of time debunking the complaints.  How about things that are actually great about this game?  No more ""stacks of doom""!  That's right.  You or the AI cannot simply load 15 units into an unbeatable stack and destroy everything on the map!  Now that units don't stack, you need to be strategic in your placement of cavalry, archers, infantry, and artillery.  Combat in this game is the best of any Civ game, hands down.  Cities are no longer vulnerable for easy taking, but can defend themselves quite well from attack.  Units can attack from a range, or maneuver around the hex tiles for a tactical advantage.  You will no longer be told you have >99% chance of winning a battle, only to lose it.  A spearman will never beat a tank! (unless that tank is really REALLY wounded)

City management has also been streamlined quite a bit, I think for the better.  If you don't want to stress about which tiles get worked, which specialists are active, etc -- don't!  The game will smartly take care of this for you.  Or you can set your city to a specific focus (i.e. production, food, gold, or culture).  Or you can roll up your sleeves and micromanage everything it does.  The choice is up to you!  A lot of key Civ features like Science/Culture/Gold sliders are gone.  You need to actually put some thought into how you build your cities so that these issues can't be fixed with the flick of a mouse.  For better or worse, a lot of other familiar features like War Weariness, Health, Pollution, and Religion are gone.  Basically, this is an entirely new game, and it's unfair to compare it to Civ II or IV and hate it just because some of the features you like have been removed.

Have I mentioned that this game is absolutely beautiful?  Especially with a high end video card (which I sadly do not have, but my GF does), the leader animations are magnificent, the landscape is gorgeous, and the animations are detailed and realistic (try setting off a Nuclear Missile and see if your jaw doesn't hit the floor).  A ton of work went into the art design in this game, and even minor things like the circular picture for each technology or the mini icon for each military unit are well-thought out and unique.

A few criticisms, though, because honestly this game still needs a few patches and maybe an expansion to be perfect.  Diplomacy is simply not very good.  The AI is constantly hostile, and there is little you can do to improve relations. Diplomatic Victory is a case of buying enough votes to win the UN election (quite easy to do or have done to you).  Multiplayer is still a bit of a mess, with no LAN or hotseat support, and an extremely stripped-down game if you play over the internet.  But I have confidence that a lot of these problems will be fixed by Firaxis and 2k games, as they have already done a superb job of addressing the Civ community's complaints, and improving their product on a steady basis.  And oh yeah: tired of the civs you can play with?  Shell out a few extra bucks for extra downloadable civs and scenarios.  Polynesia releases tomorrow.

I'm not writing this to attack the 1 and 2 star reviewers... everyone is entitled to their opinion.  I just want everyone to give this game a fair chance, because it really is something special, and has the potential to be the greatest Civ game in the series.  Personally, I'm in no rush for Civ 6... I want to enjoy this game while it's still fresh and exciting.  Once you start playing, it's impossible not to get sucked into the familiar ""One More Turn!"" addiction.

4.0,False,"05 6, 2006",A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00020LZAW,David Foskin,"Be sure to understand that Killzone is not a Halo clone. Killzone is about a handful of average soldiers being forced into working as a team as they fight through a war-torn world, often engaging in street warfare just to get to the next location.

The game begins after the Helghan invasion of of Vetka. ISA forces have been vainly in heavy combat on Vetka, but the powerful Helghan forces has left a brutal impact on the populace. The game begins with the players taking on the role of Captain Jan Templar, who fights his way back to where General Vaughton is stationed. The General sends Templar on a mission to rescue a spy, and during the process of said mission, Templar picks up three additional playable team members. From this point, this mini-squad must take on missions in reaction to the events that play out in the story.

Over the first few areas, you're only in control of the standard trooper, Templar, but as you pick up more allies, you'll get your choice of team member at the beginning of each mission. The four team members play differently and have various bonuses and detriments. Luger has heat vision, Hakha can sneak up on Helghast, while Rico is the all around heavy gunner who can take additional punishment. The action in Killzone is broken up into levels, which are further separated into sublevels. While each level features the occasional checkpoint, players can only save at the end of each stage. Rather than a seamless gameworld, Killzone's stages are broken up by lengthy load screens.

The core gameplay of Killzone is your standard FPS fare, though you will find more of the game will be spent fighting behind cover to minimize your damage. A lot of running from cover to cover should be expected. To this effect, you have a sprint button that will lower your weapon and allow you to run a short distance. You'll have primary and secondary fire (on most weapons) and even grenades to your disposal. If you get in close, you can perform a melee attack to disarm and take out your opponent.

While there is no ability to jump, you will find the occasional barrier that you can leap over. Along your path, you'll often find gun and cannon emplacements. With the tap of a button, you can use that firepower to your own. But, considering the legions of Helghast that come after you, the most heavy ammo you can drop, the better.

While Killzone does feature a variety of weapons, there is some imbalance in terms of stopping power. With only three weapons a player can have on hand, it won't take long for players to figure out what they should keep on hand. The assault rifle is pretty solid, but never has enough ammo. On the other hand, the Helghast assault rifle takes way too many bullets to drop an enemy. The shotgun has a long reload time, which almost negates it's usefulness. Of course, there's heavy ordinance to be found and abused, including grenade launchers and a rocket launcher.

Along with the main story are both online and standard multiplayer modes. Both provide extra enjoyment, but are dependent on the quality of your opponents. Fortunately, there's more of an arcade-like element to the multiplayer, allows for faster, more furious gunbattles. Of course, you can always try to play it more like the story missions, but with so many good weapons being spawned, why bother?

Visually, Killzone has a wonderful art direction that works to deliver a solid and believable gameworld. The Helghast are successfully presented as an intimidating Nazi/Jin-Roh hybrid that the player must push on through. The game world does a fine job at setting up real world locations, whether they be war ravaged streets, a park, a swamp or soldier-infested docks. Levels are laid out in such a way that most of the scenarios provide both challenge and a certain level of intensity. From a technical standpoint, though, Killzone is pushing the PS2 for all it can get and still could use more power. While there is a lot of minor details, the limited color palette and repetitive and low-res textures wash out many locations and even leave some areas feeling quite repetitive. You'll also find a serious lack of enemy variety will leave you feeling like you're killing the same foes over and over again. I have to wonder if Killzone was on a brawnier unit, would the levels have more visual detail and larger? Would there be more enemy types and would the draw distance be longer?

The audio portion proves to be a solid augment to the visual portion. Music is nicely done and works with the futuristic military theme of the story. Sound effects have a good bit of variety and range, especially in the gun sounds and explosions. In the story sequences, the voice cast (including Kal Webber, Tom Clarke Hill and Brian Cox) does a good job with the script they're given. During gameplay, though, their comments are limited and can get old pretty fast. Even worse is that the Helghast have even fewer comments, so killing them by the score isn't made better by the the repetitious comments.

Is Killzone a bad game? Not really. There is certainly a good time to be had here, but it really depends on what you have available to you. If you have access to a PC or Xbox, Killzone pales in comparison to other titles already available. If all you have is a PS2, then Killzone is likely one of the best games the genre will offer you right now. With a little more power for the engine and more refinement, this could have been a great game, but there is still a good time to be had here.","Pushes the PS2 to the limit, NOT a Halo killer though",1146873600,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This is a sort of Civilization set in the olden times, 1602 of course, when galleons discovered new worlds and set out to create trade routes and garner wealth for aristocratic settlers. The game starts by settling an island (you are in a race with the computer, who tries to beat you to a choice bit of land. Some of the islands are lousy--too many volcanoes, for one thing, or lacking essential resources.)
You need to build up from wood-cutting plantations, to cotton and grain, up to the ability to mine, forge metals and eventually build some handy cannons and muskets to take out the pesky pirates. Did I mention pirates? Well, as you are shipping from island to island, running your important trade routes, these nasty guys pop up and take your stuff, not to mention try to sink your ship. Eventually, it's payback time and you'll deal with them.
Meanwhile, it's all you can do to keep the locals happy (tip; don't forget to build a hospital. It's demoralizing to see a once-happy island decimated by the Plague.) Then the locals want more, more, more. Schools, churches, universities, even a palace and cathedral. And they like their booze and tabaccy, not to mention regular meals. If you starve the people, they won't forgive you. And you can lose.
This game has nice graphics, and is pleasing as either a single-player or multi-player game. It appeals to women as well as men because the military aspects are secondary to building and developing a new land. The only criticism is that the military function is boring. You clear your enemy islands the same way every game and it gets old. The play is straightforward and with a minimum of help from the manual, it's easy to get engrossed in game right away. You can adjust the speed to single for detail work or jump up to double speed for the boring bits. There are demos available online to download, including the new 1503 A.D., a new game, which has more complicated graphics, and enhanced ""everything"" --something to work up to when you get bored with 1602. 1602 AD is one of our favorite games of all times.","A great single player game, can be multi-player as well",1050537600,10,,

4.0,False,"11 29, 2009",A3W0POMI33YQXQ,B002C7RBFQ,Enlightened,"Look, I've been playing this game nonstop.  It's very fun but sometimes the game is just stupid.

First we will start with player movement.  Often times your player is very sluggish and slow.  Changing directions is nonexistent and the player always makes this slow turn around that frustrates to no end (if you've played the game you know what I'm talking about).  The defense is horrendous.  If you hold an opposing point guard under 20 points consider yourself an expert and if you can stop Pau Gasol from shooting 90% from the post then you have serious skills.  The post defense is simply terrible when playing against the computer.  For example you may be playing against Varejao and he's out there making it seem like he's Kareem Abdul Jabbar instead of being self-guard like he is real life.  He has no offensive post talent.  It's not conceivable to have good post defense unless Dwight Howard is on your team.

Speaking of post defense, it's nearly impossible to stay in front the opposing teams point guard.  ANY point guard.  And even with help defense turned up, your center or power forward will refuse to contest the shot.  It's ridiculous.  Then when you switch manually they switch to some small forward that has no chance to block or contest the shot leaving it open for a wide open uncontested layup by some random point guard.

Another thing that has plagued the series for a minute is the transition offense.  I'm so sick and tired of having 3 on 1 breakaway easy layups/dunks turn into an absolute nightmare.  The first obvious is WHY do the two leading the break run to the three point line??!?!?!?!??  Possibly the first drill of basketball that you learn in pee wee is the three man weave.  Nowhere in that drill is the three point line.  So why in an NBA game, where the professionals play, does Vince Carter, LeBron James, Paul Pierce run to the three point line and stop?  Completely frustrating.

Also pertaining to transition offense is the outlet pass.  The offense has crashed the boards, your three man has outletted for the fast break.  Your center throws him the ball on the outlet.  Sounds good so far except that it takes your player approximately 1.5 seconds to figure out how to catch the ball and keep running at the same time.  That's right they catch the ball with this slow motion, slow enough to allow the defense to get back in front of them and prevent the fast break.  Terrible.

So with limited success on the fast break, you are forced to slow it down and get some work in the post game.  That's not a bad idea.  So somehow we get a mismatch in the post.  Somebody switched off and it's now Chris Bosh versus some random point guard on the block.  Chris Bosh receives the ball on the post and is somehow magically not able to back down this 195 lb 6'2 point guard.  Somehow this guard has held the fort steady forcing you into some fadeaway or highly contested shot.  Unrealistic.  Not to mention the absolute worst entry passing ever in video games.  Instead of delivering a real pass like a man, they will throw this weak rainbow lob that almost always gets tipped either by the passer's man or the defender coming around the post.  This is unacceptable.

Another flaw is the abundance of alley oops by non jumpers and non passers.  I mean really is the Louis Williams to Elton Brand alley oop really a threat????  Or the Jason Williams to Brandon Bass???  Stop with the nonsense 2K!  And your team acts like the can't recognize it and jump to block the ball.  And when you switch and hit the triangle to jump they jump 1 ft off the ground not even trying.

One of the series staples is the infamous missed dunks and layups.  No need to elaborate here...just know that it has returned.  Free Throw shooting is always an issue because sometimes the game gives you this angle where you can't correctly judge when to let go resulting in missed layups.  It's just hard to stay consistent shooting free throws.

Dribbling is not fun at all.  The crossover is a chore and very ineffective and some PROFESSIONAL SG & SF's can't even crossover on the game which is completely ridiculous.  More often than not there will be plenty of pick and rolls.

In Association mode, developing a player is nearly impossible especially a rookie.  The shooting drill is just plain stupid.  The point total to achieve is ridiculously high and not only that players must now get their own rebound which is unfathomable.  So if you are trying to improve your power forward's mid range game the correct way (instead of just editing the player) you can forget it because he's more often than not too slow to finish in time and not a good enough shooter to knock down all the chances you do get.  Not to mention the sluggish player movement already discussed.  The other drills are just as useless and needless to say real player progression is a joke.

Great combat system and use of all the superpowers of each hero. Also the change of costumes from the classic ones to recent new looks for certain main characters.

Ability to play with a friend and switch characters. Play in various modes; easy, medium, hard, elite and superhero. Though aimed mostly at a male audience, female players can play as Huntress, Hawkgirl, Zatanna and of course Wonder Woman.

Once finished you can open the extended play feture and have all your experience and new costumes and superpowers upgrades transfered to a new game mode of your choice.

Unlock other heroes as game goes on.

The cons:

Gets a little repetive after a while.

No mini-games.

Details on the costumes of some characters have been omited.

Only certain heroes can and must be used in certain levels.

Overall is quite entertaining and finally get to see DC most beloved superheroes in realistic 3D form. The controls aren't that tricky to use unlike previous games that featured Batman. I think a sequel should follow.

Special notes:

If you stop playing for a minute and a half without pausing, your heroes will say 3 different funny phrases about themselves or you as the player. All heroes have them.

The art of tagging can be found from the streets of New York City to the farms of Iowa to the hills of Europe and Getting Up attempts to bring that to life. The game gives users the opportunity to travel around a fictitious city (similar to NYC) tagging surfaces, and fighting cats, meanwhile building a rep in the process. There are very few, if any, games with a similar premise and Atari definitely has taken ""cyber tagging"" to a new level with this game.

The story revolves around Trane, a young urban misfit who hopes to get a rep by tagging over rival crews pieces and whatever surface he can get his paint on. He lives in the oppressive futuristic city of New Radius and is ambitious about becoming a star graf artist, but there are a ton of obstacles to contend with. Rival tagging crews and fascist-like police officers called the Civil Conduct Keepers (CCK) are very much interested in stopping Trane and destroying his art. These obstacles are just miniscule parts of missions given for Trane to complete however. While fighting is important, the game is clearly centered on tagging. Each mission will have Trane completing a set number of graffiti-related objectives. The actual play mechanic for laying down your tags is easily picked up and you'll add new ways to apply tags as the game progresses. However, tagging anywhere just simply isn't an option. Even if you want to tag certain areas that look like they'd be perfect locations, the game will not allow you to do it. You'll be guided in your tagging quests by your intuition. In Trane's case, his intuition shows him the way to a sweet spot for putting up his tag.

As previously mentioned, obstacles such as the rival graffiti gangs and the CCK brings us to one of the most important game aspects into play: combat. Here you use punches, kicks and even some impromptu weapons such as paint cans, poles and the like. The combat system is not exactly on the level of say, Mortal Kombat, but it does have and punch combos, grabs, and power moves. The issue is that it seems like a lot of button mashing and senseless fighting. Also, the combat controls just aren't responsive enough to make the fighting really enjoyable. In fact it is almost reminiscent of old Nintendo controls, A, B, A, B.

On a positive note, Getting Up features a very difficult to rival soundtrack, story line and dialogue to accompany game play. However, while all of Getting Up's diverse elements come together as a moderately entertaining experience; it really could have used a bit more polish before it hit store shelves. If you are in to the graf culture then this is the game for you. However, if you're looking for an epic game that requires actual skill, then Getting Up is for toys.",Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure,1143763200,3,,

3.0,False,"10 31, 2011",A3MY8ACOUIQ8J7,B005WWZUQ0,Nick G.,"I have read a lot of reviews on this game and some are good and some are bad.  I have had the game sense day 1 and I am overall pleased.  No its not the exact same as BF2 but who thought it would be?...It does have many simularities.

PROS:
-Graphics and Game effects are amazing.  This is the only game that I played where Multiplayer has the same effects and graphics as single player.  Its like playing a new Single player level every game I get into.  If that makes any sense.

-Single player was I thought, very good.  Seeing that they never had a story mode before.  I found myself actually following the story which hardly ever happens.

-Movements in the game are very good.....

-The weapons and weapons upgrades are very nice and well setup.  The TAC light is amazing to blind your opponent and the Laser light is good to let them know they are about to get shot but still blinding them a little. Thank God BF3 does not do kill streak rewards like MW games.

-Maps are huge and I read a review saying that you can only go certain places and the maps were smaller than BF2....I will have to disagree.  There is no borders on the map like there were on BF2 that I have seen.....but the maps seem huge and I don't find myself being corridored in where I need to go.

-I do like the fact that they narrowed down the classes you can pick from and also each class can only carry one grenade..that is a plus...there was nothing worse than starting out a I/O map at Strike at Karkand with nothing but an all out grenade war for 10 minutes...and with the Ammo guys giving packs to everyone it never stopped...now you can still get more grenades but it happens a lot slower now and you only reload one at a time.

-Strategery...although you do not have the Commander which does suck but I still feel it is very strategic and not like a run and gun as the MW games.  You can't just get in a Map on BF3 and if you are really good your probably not going to carry your team like in the MW games.  Its a group effort.  I also noticed there is no squad speak which also sucks but thinking about it now most people as myself like using 3rd party programs to talk to your fellow peeps...but I know if you are just playing by yourself and want to tell the random person on your team to get out of a doorway then that doesn't happen...but 9 times out of 10 they wouldn't listen to you anywway.

-The game as a whole I am pretty pleased with.  I was a HC BF2 fan and although its has lots of differences I am still a fan.  Sure beats the MW games in my opinion.

-I do like the fact if you can't take the enemies home base it will make it to where you are not even aloud in there.  It will give you a out of the combat zone warning.  I think this is good in the fact that there won't be massive spawn raping when you are getting hammered by the other team.

CONS

-The game is launched with a we broweser which I think is retarted.  I agree with a lot of the reviews about this issue, and they pretty much sumed it up.

-Random disconnects, I have not has as many as other people have stated and it will be a little while before some fixes come out.  But I have had about 4 random disconnects sense I have been playing at day 1.

-Haven't heard this mentioned yet but I was in a chat party with a friend of mine and he joined a map with the party and it loaded him in the server but mine loaded the single player...this has happened to me 5 times which I think is a little much but it has only happened to my friend once.

-I think some maps need a little bit more vehicles such as jeeps or buggies because there is not enough if you are getting pounded on a map.

-THE SPAWNS....I can't count the amount of times that I will be in a building or hidden somewhere reloading and someone spawns right behind me....it happens way to often....and I have even spawned a lot of times and there is some enemy standing right in front me and of course I light him up but you would think it would be an easy fix....I know that this problem will always happen but it could be dogged down a little bit.

-CHAT WINDOW...Wow could it be any bigger....It takes up like a third of the screen its kind of ridiculous..who thought that was a good idea?  It is slightly see through but not much and its light blue.  Just a Terrible idea

Overall like I said I really like the game...it does have its bugs but every game does......give it some time if you are worried about it.  I will update if I think of anything else.  The main problem I see is with Origin and how the game launches...but the game is very enjoyable.  Thanks for reading.

UPDATE 5 DEC 2011

I have put just a little over 100 hours in on this game and I am more pleased with it then when I started.

GAME LAUNCHING UPDATE-

It looks like they fixed most of the bugs with the HUGE Nov 22nd update with the launching of the game.  I know some poeple had a lot more problems then others.  But this is what it fixed for me.

-My game has not loaded Single player when I try to join a multiplayer server sense the update in Nov.
-A lot less hangs

Some things that still need to be fixed....

*Sometimes when I join a friend in a party and it asks me if I want to join voice at the top right hand corner of the chat box...I click it...and it says I have joined voice chat but it never really joins..then you click on it again and it tells you, you are already in voice chat...The only fix I have seen for this is to exit out of the party and create another one then invite your friend or have your friend do it.  Kind of annoying and I know programs mess up from time to time but this happens way to often.

*90 percent of the time when I first bring up Battlelog and join my first map for a play session I get an error of Battlefield 3 stopped working.  All I have to do is go to that same server again and rejoin but thats not the worst part.  Here is the problem I ran into and it was very frustrating at first.  Let me explain....

---When I click on that first server the window in the bottom left comes up on battlelog saying that your connecting, then joining, then loading level.  This will stick on the loading screen if BF3 has stopped working, BUT the error window that pops up will not POP up OVER the battlelog window so you don't even know you got an error.  So there I am looking at the window that says loading for like 5 minutes and wondering why it is taking so long.  So then I click close game so I can load a new map, and then I close battelog to restart it and then I see the little BF3 stopped working window.  So from now on this is what I do....I play BF3 on Windows 7.  I have pinned a BF3 shortcut to my task bar.  Now when I click on a server and when BF3 starts to load I can see the clear box around my BF3 pinned shortcut on my taskbar and I click it.  This will either bring me to a in game loading screen with the Map in the background which then I know it is working correctly or it brings up that little window to let you know BF3 has stopped working.  I have had to tell many people this that I play with..and it has saved lots of time.

GAMEPLAY

They tweaked a lot of weapons in a good way with the big patch in November but here are my opinions....

*PLEASE oh PLEASE Get rid of Motars...Motars totally ruin all the close quarter City Maps.  All it is, is MORTAR after MORTAR.  The only time I use a motar is to kill another mortar guy.  Yes I can keep the motar guys busy by motaring them but I don't want to sit there and motar an entire round because it is EXTREMELY boring...People SPAM the MOTAR tubes way to much.  If you don't get rid of them please just do something about them.  Limit them in many ways.  I found myself and all my friends just basically playing the larger maps because 95 percent of the time its MORTAR spamming in all the other ones.

*One more thing to get rid of....the IR scope for all weapons...this thing is ridiculous.  Anything and everything that alive lights up BRIGHT ORANGE.  I think half the fun is finding the people in the map because the graphics are amazing and there are lots of spots to hide.  Everyone one uses this scope and who wouldn't...I do for the simple fact that I know 98 pecent of all users use it..so they can see my Bright Orange Butt coming from a mile away.  So I want the same advantage as they do.  If you get killed by a person in BF3 9 times out of 10 they have and IR scope and if they don't have one thats just becuase they haven't unlocked it yet or their pride keeps them from using it.

PLEASE IF THEY JUST REMOVED THOSE 2 THINGS BF3 WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER.

-HACKERS-

Seeing lots more hackers everytime I play.  Most of these are usually Aim Bots.  You will have this with any FPS.  But this is why ALL PC games(...you hear that ACTIVISION and IW.....)ALL PC games should have dedicated servers like BF3 does so the Admin can kick them.  But not all servers have admins in there at all times so to report someone as a hacker to EA, well I had to google it but here it is...

Go to the persons homepage on Battlelog and towards the top right hand corner of the screen just under the tabs, and to the right of the persons pic and name there is a little circle with a triangle in it.  If you hit this a window will pop up and say report abuse.

I do not know how EA handles there hackers yet but I hope they do.  Well all know that Steam really doesn't anything about it.  So I am curious if EA takes a different approach.  PLEASE EA DO SOMETHING!!!!!!

SUMMARY

All and all this is a very fun game, and I will continue to enjoy it.  I am a huge COD and BF fan and I personally love them both.  I have not purchased MW3 yet becuase 1 first person shooter is enough and I waited 5-6 years for the sequel to BF2.  Now I have it...at the rate COD is going by the time I get done playing BF3 they should be on MW6 by then and then I will buy it.  Thank you for reading and if you have any questions let me know.

-------UPDATE 20 June 2012---------

So after having this game for a while I wanted to update my review and knock off a couple stars because of lots of reasons. Here is the first!!!

CONS

PREMIUM- So premium came out recently and it is $50.  It comes with Back to Karkand and and believe 3 other map packs each with 4 new maps and guns plus you get to play the maps 2 weeks before anyone else being a premium player.  Also you get this tag that says premium that pops up on your opponents screen when you kill them.  Nice marketing.  This is why I do not like premium.......They get to jump ahead of you in queue when you are waiting to get into a server.  i was really excited when EA set up server queues but I did not know this was the beginning of charging extra so you can jump ahead...so now I find myself getting kicked up in queue when I am trying to join my favorite servers.  Thanks EA.

So say you already bought BF3 with the Strike to Karkand expansion.  Well it comes with premium also, so basically you will just be purchasing it again to become a premium player.  Seriously EA, is it that hard to do a 10% discount or have 2 premium bundles, one with B2K and one without?....SERIOUSLY.

Ok enough about premium now on to some game play.

-TANKS-

The thermal on the tanks is RIDICULOUS....you can see across the map and everything that is alive lights up bright white.  PLEASE FIX!!!  When the game first released the thermal scope for all the rifles could see just as far and they dumbed it down so now  you can only see about 30 meters or so.  Now you have tanks shooting you from 500-600-700 plus meters from there base...its ridiculous.  PLEASE FIX IT.

Another thing I have not gotten down with the tanks is the damage on them.  I will be in a tank and get hit by another tank and one shot will disable me, or one RPG will disable me and it hasn't just happened once.  It happens every time.  Doesn't not matter if I have reactive armor or what but its stupid.  I have 240 hours logged on this game and I still haven't figured it out.  I have hit tanks before with 4 T-90 tank rounds and not even disabled them but when they shoot me once I am disable.  I just don't get it.

CO-OP

I still have not been able to play co-op and neither has any of my friends that play...I know it works...I have seen many many people online with the weapons you have to unlock with co-op.  It crashes every time.

HACKERS

More and more hackers every time I get on.  I mean ridiculous hacking like killing me with a P90 while I am in a tank or using the paddles and killing me while I am flying in a jet.

MORE UPDATES

Instead of coming out with more stuff lets crack down on some stuff that is wrong with the game and make it better.

OVERALL

Its a good game but having the premium players bump me in server queues, and killing me with weapons from another map pack that I don't have in an original map I think its ridiculous.  I think its great if they are a premium player that is their choice but it shouldn't effect my game play that I gave $60 to play.  So if you pay the $50 you are better than every one else that just has the normal game. Its almost like when these companies sell a game now it's like you only get 30% of it and then you just keep paying and paying for the rest of it until the next one comes out. I guess this is what gaming on PC is coming too.  Its just pretty much turning into console online play and that is no good.  I have been a huge BF fan heck BF2 got me into online gaming and I still love that game.  Thanks EA for not caring about your original customers.

No actual ping displayed? No mods? No dedicated servers? Most weapons sound like silenced variants. Almost no recoil.

But I bet we will get plenty of DLC.

Some SP mission are fun, including UAVs, I'll give you that. Scripted to hell, but it is still fun. Graphics is very crisp. Problem is it's about 4-5 hours long. Good movie these days is about $10 for 2hr+ flick. So about $5/hr of entertainment. With CODMW2 you shell out $60 for 4hr, thus paying $15/hr.

It is a sad fact that game development of major A title costs upward of $40 million. Mainstream gaming has been heading console direction for a while. There are many reasons for that. This is very good example of the trend.

EDIT: More thoughts on SP gameplay... (I didn't even bother to spend a lot of time in MP.) Since MW2 took after World at War, it is very irritating when game switches between characters all the time. Quickly you lose track of who is who. Plot is impossible to figure out. I wished MW1 continued... May be I'm getting old but in order to enjoy hectic combat you really need to be a 14 y/o high on red bull with strobe lights flashing and techno blasting at the same time. Half of the time your screen will be splattered in red with ""RELOADING"" blinking... No matter where you turn, there are always at least four new enemies pop up like jack in the box at your 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock and you never have time to reload. This game tries to be serious and Serious Sam at the same time. Jeebus Chroist, pick your poison and stick to it, Infinity Ward! I really enjoyed MW1, combat was tense where needed, not non-stop glow stick fest at the Annual Big Rave. And yes, you will miss no-lean in about 2 minutes into the game. And yes, AI can lean and use cover to fire...

On a positive note: Game runs very smoothly maxed out and what features that still remained in the game were pretty well polished. Voice acting, motion capture, models, explosions are superb. I'm running it on Windows 7 64bit, E8400, 4G of RAM, HD 4890 and 2 Intel X-25m in RAID-0.

Story

Listen, I'm not much of a fan of storylines in videogames, but having said that, I do recognize when a game has a great storyline (Drake's Fortune) and a terrible one (Resident Evil 5). The story of Darksiders is forgettable and confusing. I found myself skipping most cut scenes. This is easily the weakest part of the game.

Gameplay

This is where Darksiders shines. The gameplay is really, really fun. As people have mentioned it is a combination of God of War and Zelda, but in no way is it a copy of these games. It's definitely it's own, unique game for sure.

You get plenty of weapons and magic, and upgrades to both throughout the adventure, which by the way, will take you 20-25 hours to complete. As the game progresses the puzzles become much more difficult and new things are added, such as the glaive and portal gun. Simply put, this game has a terrific balance of combat, platforming and puzzle solving. I found myself looking forward to playing it every day and making progress.

Graphics

The graphics are great, a little on the cartoon-ie side, but still very sharp. Combos look and feel great and the level design is really unique. As I mentioned earlier, the developers really did a great job creating this open world.

Enjoyment

I enjoyed this game a lot. If you are into games like God of War and Zelda, this is a perfect fit for you. My only complaint is the puzzles become too difficult the last 3rd of the game, kind of ruining the great pace by having to stop and look at walkthroughs to figure out what you're doing. Small complaint...bottom line...this game is 100% worth a purchase. It is a game that I will not soon forget and really was a great experience.",Darksiders is Worth Every Penny!,1266969600,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},
4.0,False,"07 20, 2002",A38CXCQNIAS0AI,B000069LH9,Andrew X. Lias,"I was part of the beta for this game and among the hoards who vowed that that they would never submit to this insane pricing plan.  Well, it's less than a month since the beta ended, and here I am meekly licking Wizards of the Coast's boots.  It's sad, really.  Unfortunately, this really does combine everything that made Magic: the Gathering addictive in the first place with the additional conveniences of always being able to find a player and of having the computer act as an automatic rules interpreter.
I will note that the interface could stand a certain amount of improvement.  There's absolutely no scroll button support, even for such simple tasks as scrolling through menus, and some of the right click options are less than intuitive.  They could also benefit from such features as a way to print your card lists out, an easier way to find open tables (yes, I am familiar with all of the ways to do so -- they're all substandard), and other minor things that I hope will eventually get patched.  Overall, though, the interface is well done and do an admirable job of capturing the play and feel of the original game.

4.0,False,"12 31, 2008",A3W4NLU1LAA153,B001AWBYNE,Chris L,"COD-WAW - the latest installment of the Call Of Duty series is set in the closing stages of WWII. As with most COD games, you alternate between two characters. In this case a Russian advancing on Berlin, and an American GI clearing out the Japanese islands.

Controls
As you'd expect, COD-WAW is a first-person run-and-gun game. You can sneak (and on some maps you have to) but for the most part it's shoot or be shot at. The controls are pretty good for this. Left stick moves you, right stick adjusts where you're looking. Various buttons crouch, jump, reload and fire. It's fairly intuitive to pick up and the controls are identical to the hugely playable COD4.

Graphics
The graphics in COD5 are excellent. The environments are detailed and the map size is up on COD4 with some truly sprawling levels this time around. The Berlin levels leading to the Reichstag are simply incredible with brilliant artwork and modelling that truly represents the bombed-out city at the end of the War. The amount of popup (where items suddenly pop in to view) is lessened compared to COD4 but it's still very noticable, especially when approaching the windows of a building to look out. As with COD4, to start with you won't notice it, but once it catches your eye, you'll see it everywhere. The smoke and particle effects have been heavily modified this time around and are much improved. The smoke grenades in particular do not stress the PS3 anywhere near as much as they did in the previous game. There are specular highlights and bump maps used where you'd expect them to be used to pretty good effect. One of the neatest effects is the visual distortion you get around the muzzle of a gun during gunfire, or around an exploding grenade. Nice touch.
New in COD5 is ""graphic"" content, by which I mean mutilated bodies. With the advent of the flamethrower - a truly terrible weapon - you will be presented with burned, mutilated bodies as a result. In multiplayer mode, your character takes damage now too - step on a landmine and in the instant replay you'll see your leg blown off with nothing but a bloody stump remaining. For the parents or squeamish, these effects can all be turned off though.

Sound
The audio on COD-WAW is also improved somewhat on the previous game. There's good stereo separation at the front and excellent use of the rear channels. Often you'll be able to hear someone behind you giving you more reaction time to do something about it. The weapons effects are OK and they use the subwoofer to good effect. Again there's noticable differences in weapons types, with and without suppressors, but I suppose only a classic gun nut would be able to tell you if they're right.

Single player
Single player mode is a good intro to World At War. The maps are varied and as I said in the intro, the missions are split between US and Russian troops. Each mission is a mission-on-rails in that you really can't deviate much from what the developers want you to do. Go from A to B. Kill everything. Collect item. It's a tired formula but I guess it still works. The game is mercifully short on cut-scenes so there isn't a lot of interruption. The cut scenes that do exist are a split between pre-rendered and game-engine scenes. As with all COD games, one level stands out head and shoulders above the rest, and this time around, for me it was the fleet defence mission. You find yourself as a gunner in a US flying boat trying to defend part of the US fleet against Japanese attack. The aircraft in question has 4 guns - left and right waist, nose and tail. The brilliant thing is that you can swap to the different guns, and when you do, rather than simply cut to the new position, you run through the aircraft, past other crew members to the new gunnery station. The first time I played this level it was an unexpected gem in the otherwise ground-based game. Having said that, the three maps leading to the toppling of the Reichstag in Berlin are also worthy of note because of the sheer scale and detail.
One fun addition is the Nazi Zombies level. Once you finish the single player game once, there is a one-off level that you can play where you are locked in an abandoned house. Nazi zombies swarm the house and your job is to kill as many as you can before being overwhelmed. You can rebuild window barricades as they are pulled down by the attacking horde but it takes time - time you don't often have. There are extra sections of the house that can be unlocked once you have enough points. The advantage is that more powerful weapons exist elsewhere in the house, but then so do more doors and windows for the zombies to get in. There are a couple of awards - instant kill, nuke, and 2x points. Ultimately you'll be mauled to death by a hideous Michael-Jackson-Thriller-like zombie with glowing eyes, but how many can you take down before it happens. This is actually a surprisingly fun level to play and re-play although it's not obvious why it was included in World At War.

Online
Online gameplay is where COD-WAW really shines in terms of fun factor. As with COD4, there's a load-balancing system so newbies don't drop into maps with 8 year old Korean kids who can snipe them through glitches in the map. The experience points (XP) system is present and correct as are the commensurate unlocks and and challenges. The more kills you get, the more matches you play, the more experience points you get. These unlock the challenges and the ability to make your own weapons load (instead of choosing one of the predetermined ones) as well as perks. Perks are things like the ability to carry three grenades instead of one.

There are a bunch of different online modes ranging from the usual capture the flags (Domination, straight from Halo), to headquarters, search-and-destroy and outright free-for-all and deathmatch. Team Tactical is a neat mode where each time only has three players, so the games become a lot more tactical. That mode also relies on headset chat otherwise you'll be running around completely uncoordinated. A new addition to World At War is the ""War"" multiplayer mode which is similar to Domination except that it's a proper staged battle across a map. The teams start either side and have to push towards the other team's base camp by capturing the flags as they go. The more you capture, and the more kills you get, the more 'momentum' your team builds. More momentum means quicker flag captures and respawns, which in effect rewards you for teamplay. The better you play as a team, the easier it becomes for you to overwhelm the opposing team with force.
In addition, there are now vehicles in some multiplayer maps - typically tanks. They have two positions - driver/gunner and machinegunner, so up to two players can get in and roam around the map reaping destruction. There are vehicle challenges to go with this new feature - miles driven, most people killed with the main gun etc., and there are also anti-tank weapons and sticky mines so that foot-soldiers stand some chance of taking out the armour. This is a nice touch but I can't help but wonder if it was put in in an effort to compete with the Battlefield series of games.
As with COD4 there are instant rewards in multiplayer. Three kills and you get aerial reconaissance, meaning you can see the other team's locations on your map. Five in a row and you get artillery. Seven in a row and you get to call in the dogs. Opinion is split on the dogs. Some people preferred the helicopter in COD4, but I sort of like the dogs idea. If you're quick, you can actually defend yourself against a dog attack. With the helicopter, you had no choice but to hide.

New to World at War is cooperative gameplay. This is where you can play with other players instead of against them. For example having 4 of you locked in the nazi zombie level, or trying to complete campaign missions with 3 other players instead of the computer-controlled AI characters. This is a nice addition and it has all its own awards and challenges to be completed too.

The biggest drawback of the online play is that the code still isn't distributed. This means that one person's machine is hosting the game. If they get annoyed at losing a battle, or being shot too many times, they can cancel the entire match, resulting in a ""host ended session"" message for everyone else. This is really nasty. In World At War, they do seem to have tried to implement code that migrates the host but it doesn't seem to work. Worse still, the send-you-to-the-same-game bug is still very prominent. If you're playing online and you decide you want out of the game, you can quit and go back to the multiplayer lobby. The problem is that if you then try to find another game, it will invariably dump you right back into the one you just left. Worse still, they still haven't solved the issue where it dumps you into games that have either just ended, or are within a couple of points of ending. This means you spend a considerable amount of time being shuttled from host to host just trying to find a game that is about to start. This and this alone is why I took a star off the review for this game. It was bad in COD4 and it should have been fixed. The fact that these problems still exist is inexcusable.

Trophies
World At War supports the PS3's new trophy system. There are dozens to collect both in single player, multiplayer online and co-op modes.

Four stars or five?
Very few games deserve 5-star rating at this point. Developers are still learning how best to get everything they can out of the PS3. Giving a game 5 stars implies the developers have nowhere left to turn for future improvements. This happens rarely although because of the improvements over COD4 I was willing to go the 5-star route. The improvements in the game engine, the sound effects, the smoke and explosion effects, and the engaging gameplay all help to raise the bar, but as I said above, the fact that it still suffers the abominable problems with multiplayer hosting are reason enough to bring the rating down again.
It's quick to pick up and the online play, despite the server glitches, still has a high X-factor. As with COD4 it's hard to say what makes the game so much fun but it has that certain something that will probably keep you coming back. In the end, that's what it's all about. You can have all the hype and fanfare you like, but if your game has spectacular graphics, a long and twisting storyline but no fun factor, people won't play it. COD-WAW has good graphics, good sound, mercifully little storyline and it's fun to play.",World War II in hi-def.,1230681600,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Dig Dug

Xevious
Dragon Spirit
Bosconian

Mappy

Bonus games:

I did not detect anything different from these games and their arcade counterparts, like some other die-hard game reviewers did. Like the Activision Anthology, this collection also has an 80s soundtrack of different songs to listen to while you're choosing your options. My favorites are the Pac Man and Pole Position games, Galaxian, Dig Dug and Xevious. I got into Mappy and Rally-X a little, they're fun ""cute type"" games. I tried Bosconian and Sky Kid a couple of times. In order to play the bonus games, you must achieve a high score on their related games. The instruction booklet does NOT say what those scores are.

Now the bad stuff. You can choose options (number of lives, etc.) but going from screen to screen seems to take a long time. It's like you're saying ""Come on already"" waiting for the next screen. Once the game starts, you must play it through. You can't go back to the beginning, though I believe you can pause the game if the phone or doorbell rings. When the game is over, you must start from the beginning. You can't pick up from the level you were at, which is annoying as all Hell. And like the others have said, other than the two bonus games, there's no special features like interviews or anything like that. It would've been nice, but oh well.

I have three of the PS1 Namco collections, but here at least most of the ""biggies"" are on one disc. Despite the slow loading, this disc is mostly a ""must have"" if you were around in the 80s.

Normally I purchase Need for Speed Titles, and a Test Drive Unlimited here and there, also your standard Open World Action games like Grand Theft Auto and Sleeping Dogs and the like. Those last ones aren't real racing games but they have a lot of elements. So thats my background coming into Horizon, more Arcade racing experience. Now let me say Horizon is probably in the middle of arcade and sim in my opinion, the cars feel 'heavier' and hug the road more then I was use to even with all the driving assists on. This is not a complaint however, the mix of arcade and sim here felt good, and it didn't take me long to get the 'feel' for it. I did turn the road guide off, as I found it distracting to have a green line to tell you how your driving is, but that option is there. I managed to place 1st place in every race so far, so I think it does a good job of scaling for people who are coming in from the Arcade-y/NFS background like me. I cant say anything about the Sim aspects so I'll move on.

The world itself is beautiful, and to me at least there seems like a lot of cars. The showroom in the game lists over 130 vehicles for purchase, though I am unsure if there are more hidden in the game. This is a lot compared to most Arcade racing games, so personally I'm happy with the number, though I find it disappointing all the best brands are represented but Porsche, however I understand this has to do with licensing issues involving EA Games so I cant blame the developers for that, however the Porsche knockoff RUF are available, so it softens that blow.

All in all I'd recommend it for arcade racing fans looking to come over from Need For Speed or Test Drive Unlimited, the game play is great and while the cars are more sim-y then I am personally use to, it works out nicely.

As for why I knocked off a star from the rating overall, its because a stupid decision, probably on the part of Microsoft rather then the developers drags the experience down. Apparently you are unable to claim any in-game gift cars for purchasing game Unless you have a Xbox Live Gold account. Shame on Microsoft for that, its a gift from the Community team, and yet it tells you that you must be a gold member to claim them.

The screen resolution is great on official Nintendo services/ profucts. It really lacks resolution for things like youtube/ browser (which is awkward to get used to) and it's about average on regular DS games. But it's not 'bad' especially since it's a game system, not an iphone.

The system it self is simply beautiful. It's a matte (thank god) white, but the mickey heads are glossy. The inside/ back are just white, which was what I wanted. It's a big system, but it still fits in my pocket.

I bought the clear plastic Hori case to put on it, as the Mickey heads seem like they could be rubbed off eventually. The case is slightly 'cloudy' but it doesn't show much with this version. I also got Hori screen protectors, which seem pretty nice so far. I highly suggest putting screen protectors on before you turn this thing on. A case is a good idea too, for the finish.

I *would* tell anyone to get this, but with the 'new 3DS' I think it's up to prefrence. The new one does seem to be upgraded, but the finish was wonderful on this one. I chose it over the new 3DS mainly for looks. Mine was fairly late on shipping, but that was a bank-mess up.

4.0,False,"03 22, 2015",A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00KWJ4JW4,Bella,"I've been calling myself a ""lapsed Final Fantasy fan"" for quite some time now. This opinion has started many a flame war on the internet, and quite frankly, I've never understood why. It's hard to defend the sharp nose-dive in quality that the series has taken in recent years. Tetsuya Nomura and Motomu Toriyama have steered what was once supposed to be a series about grand, sweeping adventures into an edgy, grimdark pit occupied by pretty teenagers wearing lots of buckles and zippers.

Numerous spin-offs, only a small percentage of which are decent, have saturated the brand name. The core series has somehow gotten less robust and interesting than it once was, with XIII being a series of ornate hallways, XIV being an MMO that, while decent, apes a lot from better, less costly games, and XV looking to be a cribbing of both Monster Hunter and the worst elements of Western AAA games... not to mention possessing the most obnoxious cast to date. While this is just my opinion, I do find it a bit baffling that anybody would adamantly defend the choices Nomura and Toriyama have made, polluting a series that once gave us excellent titles like IV, VI, VII, IX, X and some of the early spin-offs. Different strokes, I guess.

And, looking at Final Fantasy Type-0 HD (it was originally a Japan-only PSP title back in 2011,) I really expected more of the same. Long, complicated, fake words that do nothing other than make the story a convoluted garble of boring lore. Characters that look ripped from the cover of Tiger Beat, decked out with zippers that do nothing and lead to nowhere. Boring, generic gameplay that simply allows the player to go from point A to B, and nothing more. Imagine my surprise, then, that Type-0 is not only the best entry in the Final Fantasy series to hit a home console since the PS2 days, but simultaneously one of the most engaging RPGs and exciting action games I've played on a current-gen console. It has problems, yes. Undoubtedly. But it's a step in the right direction.

But the plot could fool you into thinking otherwise, initially. There's a school called Akademia (snort) that trains elite soldiers to train in the front lines of a raging war between four nations. All of these students have different abilities, strengths, weaknesses, so on, so forth. One military, in particular, is trying to wage war on all of the nations, and take everything under their iron fist, and it's up to Akademia and their growing list of allies to team up and overthrow the threat. But, despite looking pretty decent on the surface, the intent behind Akademia and its enigmatic head might not be all that they seem. Or... something.

Yes, as people who have played this game so far might notice, that is a very, very pared-down version of the narrative. Honestly,  Type-0, despite gradually growing into an engaging, interesting game, still suffers from problems hallmark to Final Fantasy games made in the last ten years. That is to say, the narrative is jam-packed with moronically-spelled words, all crammed together at once, in hopes of building a deep, intricate world with lots to learn about.

In actuality, though, it only results in a story that's interesting until people try to actually explain what's happening using made-up lingo. Yes, there are things to help understand it somewhat, but I've always felt that's a bad narrative decision. Your story should make sense and not be packed to the brim with whimsical buzzwords to begin with, which should then stimulate me to learn more, not the other way around. It's not as egregious as the worst parts of XIII, which is apparently part of the same canon, but it can get pretty obnoxious. At least, though, the surface level, bare bones narrative makes enough sense to follow and be engaged by, and again, it does pick up once things get rolling.

Luckily, though, the similarities to modern Final Fantasy games end there. Unlike XIII, which made you play for 30-40 hours until the gameplay turned into something more than ""press X and sometimes use an Eidolen to win,"" Type-0 is fun and stimulating right from the get-go. After the lengthy intro, you're dropped straight into combat, and it's soon thereafter that you'll start to realize that this is, mechanically, one of the best entries in the franchise. Playing like a pared-down version of a Devil May Cry-type affair, we have a game that's part action, part role-playing, all fun.

Each of the fourteen characters play in a distinctly different way, meaning that players can experiment with both main campaign missions and side quests until they find the party that works for them. Do you want to focus on long-range attacks and buffs, or maybe heavy melee attacks and attack spells? There are dozens of possible combinations, so players are bound to find something they like with all of the choice. There's not really a definitive ""best"" type of trio to have, and it ultimately boils down to how you want to play. Personally, I always find that to be the most rewarding type of game, and I commend the devs for breaking from the traditional ""this is how you do X thing exactly"" rut that Final Fantasy games often find themselves stuck in. It's pretty neat stuff.

There's also a ton of different stuff to do on top of the solid base of fast-paced action. This makes for the most Final Fantasy-y Final Fantasy in a while, surprisingly enough. Players can explore Akademia, getting to know the student body, upgrading their characters and attending different classes to strengthen their party en masse. They can take up side-quests to get items, level up, and just find new stuff. They can explore the world map, gradually unlocking more as the campaign continues, and gett lost in optional side-dungeons or cities. There's a ton to here, really, and that's quite the surprise for me. Most action-oriented spin-offs of this series have been linear, not matching up the open-world epic quest feeling of the main games. Now, though, Type-0 ironically feels a lot more like what the franchise is supposed to be than the core games, and that's something worth celebrating, I feel.

It's also worth noting that there are light RTS elements sprinkled into the campaign when players overthrow or protect regions, and they're implemented in such a way that it feels like a natural, fun shift, as opposed to unnecessary drudgery. It's nice that this isn't another ActRaiser situation: fun core mechanics, dull progression.

There's very little about this game that I'd call dull, actually. Very little, though, not nothing, because honestly, the way that players find themselves leveling their characters is a bit of a slog, and not in line with the fun, streamlined nature of the rest of the package. In fact, I wasn't even completely aware I could upgrade anything until multiple hours into the experience. Done at save crystals, players will use points accrued through leveling up to strengthen their characters of choice, and the experience is quite the tedious one. A long list with annoying pop-ups that are slow to disappear, the process through which players upgrade their characters is monotonous and takes way longer than it should, especially with fourteen effing characters to maintain. It's a royal pain, and an unwelcome departure from a series that has introduced ingenious leveling mechanics like the Sphere Grid and the Crystarium.

My sentiments are the same for the process of upgrading spells. When players kill enemies, they explode their corpses (!) and synthesize special gems from them. These gems are used to strengthen magic, and lord, is it easily the worst part of the game. Each element of spell has a series of sub-spells that are only differentiated by confusing acronyms, and not, you know, actual names. And all of the characters have different types of acronym spells, and you have to access a separate screen to see who knows what, and, well, you're probably beginning to see the problem here. You'll end up wasting gems you earned in battle upgrading the wrong spell for the wrong character, without even knowing you're doing so. The system in place here is clunky and unnecessarily complicated, and could have done with more streamlining. It reeks of being limited by its original platform, and not being upgraded for home consoles. Four years after release, that's a bit of a letdown.

You know what else wasn't upgraded for home consoles? A lot of the visuals, because, easily, this is one of the most badly textured games on modern consoles. Some of the textures are literally ripped straight from the PSP, and look godawful when blown up on a bigger screen. The same can be said for 80-90% of the NPC models, who are disturbingly static, never doing anything beyond standing in uncomfortable poses and moving ever-so-slightly to simulate breathing. Some parts of this game are simply ugly and a brutal letdown for a series that's always prided itself on sharp visuals.

But the odd thing is, it's only some of the textures. Other textures and models and whatnot look astounding, and more in line with what I expect for my sixty-dollar purchase from a AAA publisher. Namely, places you're doing battle and the characters you're controlling look fantastic, and make me long for a version of this game that looks consistently good. It's a bit jarring when a beautifully rendered and animated model is standing next to a static one rendered with muddy textures from a handheld. Yes, the exaggerated motion blur and carefully positioned lighting makes you not notice the visual flaws at times, but it takes only a cursory look to see that this game is not what it could be in the looks department, and that's a real shame. The art direction is great and all, but sometimes, that can only go so far.

At the very least, though, the soundtrack is gorgeous. It's the signature mixture of electronic and orchestral sensibilities that has anchored the series since the early 2000's, and it works just as well here as it ever has. In particular, the remixes of classic tunes, like the main theme of the series (used for the background of Akademia) and the darker version of the Chocobo theme (used for the overworld theme) are fantastic. The battle themes are nothing to sneeze at, either, and a bit catchy as well. Oh, and that classic ""victory theme"" is just as good ever, and makes leveling up feel that much more satisfying.

Is Final Fantasy Type-0 HD a good game? Undoubtedly, yes. It's the best game in the franchise for way, way too long, and has hours of fun, engaging content that'll keep you busy for quite some time, on top of having a load of replay value. But on the flip side, is it all that it could be? No, not quite. The leveling system is flat-out dull, the visuals aren't up to snuff for a sixty dollar game on a home console, and the plot still has a lot of the same niggling flaws as other entries where Tetsuya Nomura and Motomu Toriyama have been at the reigns.

The end result is a game that recaptures what the series is supposed to be all about, but is still held back by some meandering issues that prevent the game from being a gung-ho, balls-out return to glory. Still, though, it's hard to deny that this is a very good game with a lot of great things going for it, and for fans jaded after a series of duds, that's more than enough reason to pick this up.

Pros
- Interesting story and world
- Fantastic core gameplay
- Lots of diverse content
- Pleasing art direction
- Great soundtrack

Cons
- Underwhelming visuals
- Dull leveling systems
- Counter-intuitive menus
- Still a convouluted Nomura/Toriyama joint

Score: 8

The dock has a blue light all around the base when it is plugged in also when you place the dead controller on it that half shows a red glow instead of blue until it is charged. made the mistake of putting in master bedroom and it is not very conducive to sleeping. The headset works great but I have found my head is entirely too small and it digs into my ear but fit my husbands head perfectly (he has a rather large head). also the wires break very easily on the headset by the ear piece as well as the plug in. the clips inside the microphone boom broke so instead of having limited rotation it can now turn freely which added to me liking it as the mic was at a strange angle and not for either ear for me.

Technically, it is a wonder to behold - even at 800x600 on medium detail (all my system can handle).  It looks so damn REAL!  The visuals, sound effects, animations, are all perfect.  With so many areas dark, you start playing by sound, rather than sight - the sound is that good.

Gameplay wise, it is less of a shooter and more like a haunted house; a damned good haunted house.  EVERYTHING in the game is scripted, which will probably limit replay value, but it plays like a damned movie!  Play this with the lights down low - it's one helluva ride ;)

4.0,False,"11 24, 2004",A1TJIJKKN15KR9,B0001UEHP8,drqshadow,"Fable's main plot reads more like a book of clichd, overused storyline elements than the attention-grabbing, emotion-fluttering heavyweight it was so obviously meant to be. The nameless lead character is introduced to us as a young boy, enjoying the last few days of his innocence, when a surprise bandit raid results in the senseless slaughter of every living soul in his hometown. And, just as the bandits are about to finish the deed by wiping our young narrator from the face of the planet, he's saved at the last moment by a powerful warrior who takes the boy under his wing and trains him at his nationally-recognized ""hero school."" I'm sure you can imagine where the story leads from there... a never-ending hunt for clues about the fate of his family, and a bloodthirsty search for revenge. Well... maybe ""bloodthirsty"" is a bit too strong of a word for this uncharismatic main character, since the limits of his emotional range seem to be mild annoyance and very slight pleasure.

There's no connection whatsoever between the main character and the main villain (which is, generally speaking, supposed to be the story's ""home run"" relationship) so their ultimate collision means next to nothing. Avoiding all the sidequests, the main plot itself is really quite short and despite all the emphasis on your decisions throughout the game affecting its outcome, the one single decision that makes a difference doesn't arrive until after you've laid the finishing touches on the end boss.

In about as short a terms as I can define it, this game plays like a mixture of Onimusha, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. Obviously, with the storyline's central focus being the main character's constant struggle between darkness and light, (and the way his everyday decisions affect that status) the comparisons to KOTOR almost write themselves. Your appearance slowly changes from everyday to angelic to demonic, depending on your decisions, and is gradual enough to keep the player from noticing straight away. Likewise, by increasing your attributes in the strength or magic departments, you either slowly grow in size and stature or whither away into a shriveled, powerful magician.

Like Onimusha, you don't receive the experience from your battles until you've chased down the little glowing green bubble that bursts out of the bodies of your fallen opponents. The EXP will fade away if you don't get to it in time, but you can give it a little tug in your direction by holding the ""R"" button. Accumulated experience can be spent on different abilities, (such as additional strength, the capacity to take more damage, better aim with your bow and arrow, more spells to cast in the heat of a battle, extra speed, etc.) as though you were merely shopping for items.

And, like all of Zelda's post-N64 titles, the actual hackin' and slashin' is both challenging and enjoyable. You'll occasionally run into trouble trying to target a specific enemy in a horde, or maintaining a lock on your target while dodging arrows and blades, but that's acceptable and actually quite a ways more realistic than most of the competition. Plus, the battle system itself is loose enough to make correcting for these quirks a snap. You can choose between fighting close range with a blade, short or long range with a bow and arrow, or any distance with your magic, with each method offering unique pros and cons.

As you make your way through the game, you retrieve your main quests from the ""Hero School"". Apparently, a big part of the school's (and your character's) funding comes from the completion of various tasks, missions and requests as proposed by the world's citizens in need. Your quests range from ""help the merchant through the dark, scary woods"" to ""hunt down and decapitate the bandit mastermind,"" and are all over the board in terms of difficulty, length and reward. Gameplay is a dream come true.

The graphics are tough to classify. On one hand, they don't even compare to the photorealism of some of their contemporaries, but on the other... they don't really aim to. There's a visual flair to the graphics of Fable, a distinct style that alludes to photorealism but retains the kind of personality, emotion and, for lack of a better word, humanity, that's missing from most games. While they don't look exactly like the kind of people you'd see walking down the dirt roads of the local renaissance festival, they've got just as much emotion in their expressions, reactions and personal flair.

The audio is a home run. The villagers have almost thousands of different expressions, reactions, quips, comments and responses to fit any situation. The easily-identifiable British accent of every character in the game helps Fable stand apart from the pack, and solidifies its timeframe somewhere in the middle ages. The villagers even borrow a few lines from Monty Python's Search for the Holy Grail, and while that's one of the most wrongfully-quoted movies of all time, it's used sparingly and effectively here and feels more like a funny side joke than an annoying, forced homage. The musical score is minimal, and the occasionally-necessary transition from the ""wandering alone in the forest"" theme to the ""ambushed by thieves"" theme is quick, seamless and effortless. It does its job.

Basically, in Fable you've got a game that looks great, sounds great, plays like a dream, incorporates some unique new gameplay elements, features some outstanding voice acting, attempts to perfect on some tried-and-true existing mechanics, and simply lacks any sort of mentionable storyline. If you can live with making that one sacrifice to enjoy all the greatness that surrounds it, you'll really enjoy yourself with this. The big problem here wasn't necessarily in the game itself, but in all the hype and delays that cornered the title before it could even hit the market and the lack of focus on a clear, interesting story.","Superb gameplay, refreshing graphics, sub-standard storyline",1101254400,2,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

The short of it is that IF you're a Halo fan or know one- this is a must. Granted, I'm not speaking of the brainless trigger finger kids that feel that Halo is their outlet for shooting other mindless morons in the face and gloating non-stop about it- I'm talking about the Halo fans that love the game only as much as they love the fiction and the universe Bungie created. Halo Wars not only tells a great story (an original story) with stunning, top of the line CGI, but it also has a LOT of answers to many questions most Halo fans have been asking for years.

And to the NON-Halo fan, if you're looking for a console RTS that works amazingly well for the medium, this is IT. I've played EVERY RTS on EVERY Console, this is the ONLY one that I would recommend. Because we lack the Keyboard and Mouse set up of PC gamers, we need an RTS that works with a controller... and that's what Ensemble gave us. This is fast, easy and becomes second nature almost immediately. The fun of an RTS is being in control of a large army and watching the controlled chaos unfold. PC gamers would argue that it's about setting up the micro management aspects of RTS's and that may be true for some, but the action of Halo Wars is perfect for sitting on the couch and getting the action started in 20 seconds versus 20 minutes.

4.0,True,"11 15, 2009",ACRGKIPK795SU,B0029MAXVS,Pfillip D. Tepper,"For those who have played the first two Way of the Samurai titles, you know what to expect here with the third installment. For the unintitated, it would be best to know what this game is not. It's not GTA with swords or a hack-and-slash game, it's purely a decision-based system in which you tell the story where to go by triggering inklings or scenes or behaving differently. Killing innocents and looting them or saving people from injustice and defending yourself with blunt attacks clearly imply 2 ways you can play the game but they don't necessarily guarantee you the same ending. No matter how you end the game, however, it begins in the same fashion. You're found on the battlefield within an inch of your life by two looters and, one way or another, you are led to a farming village where a cot is set up for you. From this point on, the fate of the town and its people is in your hands.

There are several endings, over 20 of them, which can take you anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to complete. Beating the game or leaving the town altogether, reseting the game, will result in the end of that play session and the final summation of ""samurai points"" you have attained. for every act of villainy such as kicking an unarmed villager or slashing/killing people who don't deserve it or are unarmed will decrease your total by 50 while progressing into a story branch and/or obtaining titles through play such as Rich Samurai for having 10,000 mon on you will raise that base total which adds or subtracts from your points bank - rewarding you with new faces/outfits/accessories/safes to hold weapons/difficulties/etc. Wanna look like Gackt in a tuxedo weilding a blacksmith hammer? Go for it.

Now to play devil's advocate: It's fun, definitely, and I'm still playing it. Over 30 hours in so far, personally, but the replay value is different for all people. For the Gears/God of War crowd, this may be too much of a chore with how slow-paced it can be or its lackluster graphics (yes, it's not Killzone 4 but no one's playing this for its looks). If you like the idea of a game being significantly different depending on whether or not you bowed to that woman or spoke negatively about that clan, you're in for a treat because while it doesn't have the same dialogue branching detail as a Bioware title, the story itself goes in another direction. That said, the con side to this is that you don't know exactly what choice will equal a desired result, which either results in trial and error or having to be faithful to a guide written by gamers. Yeah, forget about a strategy guide or in-depth explanation within the game itself, any and all support for all the titles in this series has and will come from the fans.

If you're willing to engross yourself in its world or are playing along with a guide, that's your best bet for knowing all you need to know about WotS3 and you'll still either love or hate this game. But if you're interested thus far, you may end up becoming a fan once you get used to its inner workings and controls. By no means is this a AAA title but it has so many complex nuances that makes it at the very least worth a hard look.

MK vs. DC brings this series back to it's roots and it's a lot of fun. The fatalities can be lame but they still do what they're supposed to - give you closure to a hard fought victory.

The fighting engine is a little stiff but it doesn't hinder the game play and you get used to it relatively quickly. Besides, I found it more enjoyable that Soul Calibur 4.

Bottom lins is that the game is fun. I received it today and played through the arcade mode with Scorpion and I can't wait to play through it with the other 19 characters.

Basically, you wander around the playground collecting marbles and challenge other children to various games to earn stickers to place in your sticker book.  Many smaller kids will find this feature quite appealing.  My favorite games so far are the slot cars, paper airplanes, and dodgeball.  All are simple enough (at least at the beginning) for most children to play.  For example, tetherball is exceptionally simple at the outset.  As you gain experience and skills, you will unlock more advanced versions of the games and new games as well. The game increases in difficulty as you progress.

As with most Wii games, don't expect stellar graphics quality.  The Wii is aimed towards gameplay rather than graphics and this is another good implementation of the mini-game format for which the Wii is famous.  One thing that does annoy me with the game is that although the text is in English, the children speak in Japanese.  It's kind of cute, but for the price, I'd hope they'd have taken the time to re-dub the audio portions.

Overall, I think my children will find this enjoyable and challenging.  This is a wholesome videogame that I can recommend without qualms.",Great Wii Game For Younger Kids!!,1193875200,94,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

You can tell right from the first 20 minutes of gameplay that this was a rushed effort on EA/Dice's part. They basically just wanted to push this game out their doors without having even tested it in order to grab sales before COD:Ghosts. They paid no attention to the huge amount of glitches, bugs, and ugly crashing issues. Why should you have to pay so much to suffer so much even a month after the first release? Listen: there's a reason that even after 370+ reviews BF4 barely has a 2.5 star rating. It really is that bad. Some other complaints:

SINGLE PLAYER:
-Your teammates are useless and can't shoot down one enemy standing not five feet in front of them half the time. Directing them towards that enemy doesn't help much, either.
-Although the story was well thought out, you can tell it was rushed. Campaign can be beaten on Normal difficulty in 6 hours or less. Still an hour or two longer than COD though.
-Less linear than before, which I like, but the scripting is obvious and you can tell when enemy choppers are coming in, when enemy reinforcements pop out of nowhere, etc.
-Enemies take 5 shots to drop them, or 3-4 shots from a 7.62mm DMR. When they get shot, they hardly falter or just shrug it off like it was a mosquito or something.
-Missions are full of bugs, including a few critical bugs that will crash your game and force you to restart the whole mission (there are 8 or so missions total, each with a bazillion objectives to accomplish).
-Ending was just like... Seriously? I won't spoil it for you, but if you ever get BF3.5 - er, I mean, BF4, you'll see what I mean.

MULTIPLAYER
-The crashing. I can't say anything positive until the crashes are fixed permanently.
-The weapons. Sometimes it feels like I'm dying in one hit from a 4-shots-to-kill-assault rifle. I don't know what's different, but in BF3 it actually took a bit of time to kill someone. In this game I feel like I'm sniping people from across the map with a submachine gun (and I have done that before) in less time than it takes to pop a soda can open and take a sip. Weapons have very little recoil and are laser accurate. Suppression is less effective (which can be good or bad depending on your playstyle), but it's almost to the point where I can't tell when I'm being suppressed even half the time.
-The maps are poorly designed and levelution is nothing more than eye candy and an occasional nuisance. No good CQC style maps, and some map spawns are poorly designed (especially for TDM).
-The movement feels so sluggish, which I appreciate for the realism aspect, but sometimes it'll come to the point where my character can vault over a 4 foot high concrete barrier and then have trouble going over a broken wall that's roughly knee-high. It just makes no sense. I have video footage of my character being unable to jump over a really short barrier that he should easily be able to go over even in real life. It's not just jumping over barriers, either. I can't shoot through a flight of stairs that has gaps in between the steps. My bullets can't go through a 0.5 inch thick rusty pipe.
-Vehicles still overpowered. I avoid huge conquest maps because I can never get my hands on a tank or jet and when I do, I get mauled by someone who's already no-lifed their way into a myriad of overpowered unlocked equipment for their vehicle.
-1/3 of the weapons are carried over from BF3, some with the exact same animations.
-Two of the bolt-action sniper rifles require 2 hits to the head at long ranges to kill. This just makes no sense to me regardless of how fast their bolt-action mechanism is.

Seeing as I got it on sale and the campaign was amusing and I managed to have my good moments in game, I'll rate this game 2 stars. I'd like to rate Dice/EA's performance -2 stars.

(left, right and center) The program is simple to use and works with every game, music player and movie player. This only works for PC and not for consoles. You can add more lights with a total of 9 lights and if you so want 3 lights per sector, total of 27 LIGHTS! Crazy! Not only does it work for games but you can also set it actions like getting a new email or instant message (setting a color for it) be in sync with you screen saver and setting a static color background. Nothing I can see bad or frustrating about this product other than the price, should have been at least 3 lights for $100",Background Lights!!!,1312848000,29,,

5.0,False,"12 21, 2008",A1UQUDT2Q0YENM,B001CLG6RM,Michael,"We got this for my nieces and nephews for Christmas. I'm a real gamer, my wife plays a few games now and then. Neither of us has played any of the other I spy games. We've seen the books, but I haven't found this type of thing interesting since I was little and where's waldo was popular.

We always try out games before we give them to the kids, and usually we play them for 10 or fifteen minutes. I played this for a few hours, and now my wife's addicted too! We're sure the kids are going to love it too! You just zoom around and find whatever is in the riddle. Some of it's hard to find, but us adults have always found everything.

So you have to move around a 3-d level and find the items in a riddle. There are about 10 items per riddle and in all there are 40 riddles. The movements you can make are limited (your movements are on ""rails""). This is actually a good thing since it it's impossible to get lost.

It's not given a 5 because it's a ""perfect game"", but because it does enough right to get played a lot in my house. I got it cheap because of a special deal. I don't think it's a must buy at $30, but it's definitely a great buy when it becomes a budget game.

I don't know how long it will be for sure yet, but I'm guessing that it will take us adults somewhere in the 8-10 hour range to finish it (40 riddles with 10 to 15 minutes each). I think it will take the kids longer.

Cons:
1. Sometimes the controls are a little wonky. Never had more than a momentary problem, so it's not a game killer. Also, sometimes you need to hit the number 2. Why games that control mainly with the arrow keys, a & b make you also hit the 2 button is beyond me.
2. This isn't a con if you play with your kids. Some things may need adult help--especially for kids who can't read. One of the clues is a ""rebus 4 U"". You're supposed to find the letter U, but they should have just put ""find the letter 'U'"". Clues that hard are rare. The game requires reading in some puzzles where you have to find words. Etc. Reading ones are common.
3. The gameplay is repetitive, but it's 'I spy'. What do you expect? But, I didn't like how some of the mini-games where repetitive. Kids may enjoy that repetition. There also are only 10 levels that you visit a number of times (there are 40 puzzles, so I assume you'll visit each level 4 times).

Pros:
1. Non violent puzzle fun that everyone can help with. Even though only one player controls the wiimote, my wife and I have so far sat at the tv and pointed things out to each other.
2. Good 3d graphics. Nothing amazing, but if it were just a 2d where's waldo on the wii, we wouldn't like it near as much!
3. The actual pointing at items and moving around the level is very accurate. You can use the arrow keys to move around, but the nunchuk works great too!
4. There are a few nice additions. There is a final goal in building this machine. You can play the mini-games with a second player (not interesting to us adults).
5. Auto saving. It's 2008, why doesn't every game autosave?

I realized you have to do the same objectives (with different bosses)over and over again. Don't get me wrong, the bosses were epic but to get through one circle (stage) to the other circle and to defeat the bosses was very repetitive. Furthermore, I felt the story was lacking substance, because it talks about his seven sins with a brief cinematic scene...that's all. Also, the way you collect a Judas coin, a relic or any other other object you do it in the same fashion: pull out your cross and hit circle several times.

Other than that, the core gameplay hasn't changed much from Deadly Alliance aside from combo breakers, and that's not such a good thing in my mind.  Although the likeness of the Chess and Puzzle Kombat mini games (Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, but with MK characters and Stage fatalities), and the increasingly boring and freaquently dry Konquest mode make a mountain out of the replay value, the core gameplay is just as hard to get used to as in the last game.

  I miss what MK 4 used to be, which was in my opinion the best of the series, which basically proves what most gamers (hopefully) believe, it's the gameplay not the graphics.  The one thing I could do without is the Krypt, which is annoying and tedious, and requires you to actually go through the ever dragging Konquest mode mentioned above. It basically takes you from the beginning of Mortal Kombat to the current story of Deception as Shujinko, and gives you a better understanding of how Onaga, the Dragon King (Cheep Boss) resurrected and tricked the nutty old narrator (Shujinko) of the opening sequence (breathtaking), all just to collect stupid ""Krypt keys"" that unlock stages and characters, which by the way are awesome and make the nostalgia factor go through the roof.  All in all, the obligation of Konquest mode makes unlocking the characters seem more like a dragging job than a fun and rewarding experience.

  The core gameplay isn't what it's cracked up to be, as said earlier, not much was changed from Deadly Alliance. If you loved Deadly Alliance, though, you're in luck.  They did add one more fatality per character, making 2 for each, and probably the coolest addition to Mortal Kombat, Hara-Kiri's. That is basically a chance for you to kill yourself at the end of a lost match before your opponent does a fatality on you, making it sort-of a race to see who can do a fatality first, and still giving you a chance to control your character after you've lost.  Classic stages like the Pit 1, the Dead Pool and the Living Forest make a return and are looking prettier than ever. The return of Ermak, Nightwolf, Baraka, Milleena, Sindel and Noob-Smoke, the tag-team version of Noob-Siabot and Smoke.  Each of them seemlessly change out like switching fighting styles, but they have no weapon.  Those classic characters are definetly something to look forward to!

  The graphics are the best in the series and some of the best I've seen the PS2 put out, and immensly impressive when juxtaposed to the august visuals of Tekken 5 and VF4 Evolution.  The characters have an almost un-precedented amount of detail, and the stages are vast and, surprisingly vibrant considering the dark moodiness that MK games have delivered since MK2, but that's not a bad thing, especially since it shows off how awesome the game looks. The sound, however, is definetly this games knight in shining armor, but as long as they don't get rid of Dan ""Toasty"" Forden, nobody has anything to worry about.

  The Premium Packs for (Sub-Zero for PS2 and Mileena, Baraka, Scorpion and Raiden for XBOX), includes a serialized metal trading card of the character on the cover and an extra disk with some behind-the-scenes-esque footage of most of the characters and an arcade-perfect port of The One that started it all, baby! Other fighting games take note.

  Mortal Kombat Deception is great and delivers the bloody Kombat that people have come to expect and love, although it's just in need of an overhaul gameplay-wise, it's still well-deserving of all the hype it has recieved and fans should definetly not have to think twice before making a purchace!",Fatality!,1192147200,,,

 Facts are it is a good keyboard with really nice build quality. The software however at this point is not that functional IF you want all its features so it sadly may be a deal breaker for some. The video is just to give you a bit more of a feel for the product that product pictures cant. The backlighting is a bit brighter than show in darker environments I filmed most of that in the afternoon and dusk. I did the mouse and keyboard together since I have a life outside of Amazon reviews and figured I could kill two birds with a lone stone.

 I really only need the ability to remap buttons to specific colors and I can get it to do that fine. The config needed to update the keyboard at least for that takes fine and works as it should so for me the keyboard does all it has to do in terms of backlighting.

 In some of the other modes they simply do not work and upload correctly. The splash mode for instance only allows red backlighting as a starting color despite giving the option for other colors. This is a bit of a downer as I am not a fan of rainbow modes but I found this one to be pretty cool if I could have set the starting color to something other than red. Likewise the volume dial (very cool btw!) and function keys are hard wired red which is a bit abrasive if your going for a cooler tone profile, but less of an issue if you run the full color gamut like me.

 OK with that out of the way we do have a keyboard with plenty of potential and in fact it is very good. Cherry brown switches and an nice metal / plastic build that is a major step up from gaming keyboards of lesser ilk. Hand rest is nice and it will even act as a sound card if you swing that way though I didn't test it.

 I had no issue with usb mouse pass through but I only tried it on a Ripjaws mouse and a ergonomic mouse that I just got. Both worked without issue and I was able to game (Old star wars games mostly for me with KB mouse) and type / use the net without an issue. Im not a frequent gamer due to hand issue but I do like using the KB and mouse for older FPS games and use a gamepad for most recent games.

 Keys are a personal preference I don't like typing on mechanical keys for the most part but plenty do without issue. These either come in red or brown cherries and keyboard aficionados will be able to tell the difference but its a bit more subtle if you don't have a specific preference especially between reds / browns (blues are far more obvious). Hopefully the video gives you a decent idea of the click it makes and keep in mind this is the 'brown' variant.

 Its a really nice and stylish keyboard. Software isn't quite there balance that up and see if your in for that as it has been out for a while and there still seems to be a few gremlins. How one could excuse that aspect entirely is beyond me hence why I am ducking it a star and feel if its important to you then you will likely duck it another. As a personal choice the ability to program a custom key color is all I need and that works fine. I have no friends, so no need to impress anyone with the other modes etc. YMMV.

In place of another major overhaul, however, NCAA 13 opted for some new features and animations, making the game more immersive than ever, but doing little to change the game's usual formula.

The new feature this year is Heisman challenge, a glorified Road to Glory mode that allows the player to step in to the shoes of a former Heisman Trophy winner such as Desmond Howard, Barry Sanders, or Charlie Ward, and compete in seasons on any team you wish. Inevitably this will lead to some disgusting combinations, such as Archie Griffin on Michigan or Carson Palmer on Notre Dame, but dwelling on that will only make matters worse. The Heisman Challenge's staple is reaction time, or bullet time, slowing down the game so the player can make cuts or throws with their head instead of quick reactions. In some cases, this is extremely helpful, but it also makes gameplay a little too easy at some levels. Heisman Challenge is definitely something to check out, but it won't keep you entertained for too long.

Dynasty has also seen some under the hood improvements. New recruiting options and features make each game in the season more important, as an underdog win over a top 25 opponent will net you some well-earned popularity with the recruits. This is a very welcome addition, and something which many have been wishing was part of the game for a while. More recruiting options are available for the player as well; Scouting is now an essential part of recruiting. You can see a player's ratings through the season, and target recruits based on your findings instead of being given a base grade. Calling recruits also leads to new gameplay options, and can help swing a recruit towards your school, if you're good enough. In game studio updates, provided by Rece Davis, improve the game's ESPN atmosphere, making it feel even more like you're watching the big game on television; the ESPN ticker gives you the scores from around the nation, and priority score alerts make it even easier to follow the big upsets of the heavy hitting game between top 5 teams.

Road to Glory saw some minor attention this year adding in new challenges as a college player. Despite the lack of a major overhaul it is still as fun as ever; leading your own high school player to the starting spot on a college team is extremely exciting. RTG may even be a little more difficult this year if you choose. It also touts the new reaction time used in the Heisman challenge, and contains better goals to pursue than past iterations, creating a more challenging game.

EA is touting the new animations that have been added to the game, with new receiving and throwing animations being brought into the game to improve realism, and motion blur being added as well. The new animations make the game more lifelike to be sure, and make the players look and feel more athletic, instead of moving about the field in a fashion similar to robots attempting to play American football. Motion blur never seems to be an integral part of the game, however, only popping up on replays and in between plays. Fans do have motion blur, but that seems less important than introducing motion blur in gameplay, and seeing a fan pump their fist with motion blur never made me gaze in wonder at the feat that EA achieved.  Defenses are not the omnipotent beasts they once were, and neither are receivers, for that matter. You need to make sure a receiver is looking for the ball before you throw to them, made easier by the grayed out icons that indicate your receiver is entirely oblivious to the fact you are attempting to throw them the ball. However, defensive players that aren't looking can't block the pass either, a problem that reoccurred throughout NCAA 12.

The biggest lacking feature for this year's NCAA football was the Infinity engine offered by Madden 13. Now, Madden 13 has not come out yet, and thus there has been no clear reference for its engine, giving us no clue whether it is another useless ""innovation"" provided by Madden or if it's actually a fantastic addition for the game, but it certainly is disappointing that it was not included in this year's NCAA. This is especially disappointing given that, at least in recent years, NCAA had surpassed Madden in being the elite football title produced by EA in terms of gameplay and reception.

The previous iteration of NCAA Football didn't do too much to separate itself from the line of other NCAA's, at least not in a manner similar to NCAA 11, and NCAA 13 doesn't do too much either.  For fans of college football and folks who have picked up each and every other game before it, it's a good buy, but for those simply looking for a recommendation to upgrade from NCAA 12, there's not much reason to spend the extra money for a the Heisman Challenge, new animations, and a roster update. As an individual who spent hundreds of hours on NCAA 12, I picked it up and loved it.

EDIT: I have recently had a lot of trouble loading my dynasty, as it constantly freezes during the game loading screen. I haven't been able to touch my dynasty mode after this, and it's extremely frustrating. Hopefully it will be patched soon, but as of now, with dynasty mode unable to be played correctly, I switch my position to don't buy. Wait until it's patched to buy or just save the money and continue to play '12.","New Heisman Challenge Does Little to Change a Familiar, But Still Fun, Game",1341878400,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

4.0,False,"12 30, 2005",ATBADDXLX27EW,B000ARJ1RQ,kidnugget,"I'm a huge fan of WWII shooters, and if you are too, you should buy this game without reservation.  It's loads of fun, and you play different battles for a change.  I'll list some good and bad below.

Bad Stuff:

1) Short: As other reviews have noted, I was surprised by the short game time.  I wasn't paying attention, but I beat in two days (let's say 10 hours of play, tops).  After finishing the epic Half Life 2 lately, this was pretty bad.

2) Not much of a sequel: This game seems to follow the Halo 2 system of sequels.  Much as Halo 2 really was just a short, over hyped attempt at a massive Halo online game (and just a short, cheap rehashing of the first Halo for the single player), COD2 feels the same.  The multiplayer is a BLAST, but it feels like that was the real design here instead of the single player stuff.

Middle Ground Stuff:

1) Graphics: The graphics aren't bad, but they didn't blow me away. I liked the look of it, but again, recent efforts are a leap ahead of this graphically.  The smoke effects are AWESOME and very helpful for game play, so the game isn't without innovation, but they lacked the crisp texture of Half Life 2 (not to be a fanboy).

2) Linear Game Play: Some reviewers are complaining about linear game play.  Well, guess what, it's a shooter with a story line, so I didn't expect anything different.  You have to follow certain cues.  The levels are rather large with a short load time, and if they were more expansive or the story harder to follow, the game play would suffer.  The action is great, and the objectives are always crystal clear, so no complaints about the linear game play.  I hate shooters where I'm wandering around wondering what to do next, and this never happened here.  I always knew where to go, and if linear game play is the price I pay, it's a welcome price.  This genre doesn't lean to open ended game play, so I think this like complaining there's not enough violence in a romantic comedy.

3) AI: The AI is mixed.  At times, you get pre-generated Nazis perched out waiting to ambush you, but sometimes if you charge a building, the flank you and pull off some nasty surprises.  If you charge the same building on a re-play, you'll not they use totally different tactics.  Even throwing grenades isn't a sure thing since sometimes they throw back.  You get a mix of good and bad AI here pending on the level and circumstance.

Good Stuff:

1) Health System: COD2 avoids the unrealistic magical health packs that heal you and put you back in the fray perfectly healthy (where's the realism there?!).  Instead, you can suffer a certain amount of damage right away and still live.  If it's too much damage all at once, you die (a grenade, a torso or head shot, etc).  However, if it's a small wound, your vision gets screwy, and your aim gets worse, and you recoup in a few seconds if you can take cover.  Repeated hits, though, and you die on the spot.  It enhances the crouch, lay, stand system by making cover make a real difference.  It feels rather like a Halo ""force field"" system, and it works well.  Instead of watching a health bar and scrounging for band aids, you use your head and stay frosty, and you'll survive a firefight.  The health system makes you think instead of waste time doubling back for that health pack you left at the Nazi desk three building back.  Well done, great game play.

2) New Battles: While staples such as Stalingrad and D-Day are there, you play a different part of those battles.  You do a lot of the African campaign and some unique European battles you haven't done before.  The battles on Hill 402 at the bunker are pretty awesome.  I've seldom been as engaged by a WWII shooter as I was killing mortar teams and fighting a mounting Nazi advance, scrounging for ammo during brief lulls.  Well done.

Overall, this game is great.  It's short, so you may wait for it to drop 10 bucks, but the online play more than makes up for the brief nature of the single player.  If you're a WWII shooter fan, this is a must for your collection.  You'll have a good time and enjoy some COD2 mechanics.","Great Shooter, here is the good and the bad",1135900800,6,,

3.0,False,"07 20, 2015",ACZHUASYYSXW2,B00R9NWEFK,Casey Mosier,"After a long 2 years, EA SPORTS released its first golf title on the next gen consoles.  The newly branded EA SPORTS Rory McIlroy PGA TOUR has been rebuilt from the ground up using the Frostbite engine.  Complete rebuilds are always cause for concern as far as content goes.  With a week gone since launch, lets see how Rory McIlroy PGA Tour shakes out.

One area where this game truly shines is its presentation.  The game uses very authentic presentation styles (The Golf Channel), as well as some great overlays that help tell the story of your round.  The commentary itself is extremely well done.  It flows very well and you even hear a few stutters from the commentators like a real life broadcast.  Transitions in the commentary are seamless between the banter and stroke by stroke action.  There are tines where they will talk about other golfers on the course, past rounds historically, as well as your previous round if you are playing a multiple round tournament.

While the commentary is well done, it is HIGHLY repetitive.  If I hear Frank he had the touch of a plumber on that one again I might vomit.  Honestly I have only heard a variety of maybe 6 different commentary lines when missing a putt.

The other area that really shines is the graphics.  This game really pops throughout the gameplay.  The courses look almost exactly like the real course.

The gameplay itself is very well done, albeit with some questionable design decisions.  If you have played an EA SPORTS Golf title before this, the gameplay should feel very familiar.  The usual up and down swing is back again as is the fade/draw diagonal swing.

The up and down swing on the left analog stick has a back swing accuracy feedback as well as a club speed accuracy feedback on the higher difficulty settings.  The back swing accuracy feedback gives you an over-swing and under-swing modifier broken down by percentage (under-swing 4%) that affects your possible stroke distance.  The club head speed works the same way.

My biggest complaint would be that no matter the difficulty, swinging the golf club is way too forgiving.  The penalty for missing a perfect swing right or left feels non-existent.  Missing a swing forward or back provides a good penalty on the higher swing difficulties and that is fine.  But the ease in hitting the fairways is really holding the gameplay back from the next level.

The player swings look beautiful but in the single player (pro career) there is no way to customize your swing.  To me that is a very odd design decision.

Also on the suspect list is the overall lack of available courses at launch.  Missing are the stalwarts like Pebble Beach and Augusta.  Launching with just 8 courses and 2 fantasy courses is a long way from what we are used to.  Granted they have said that more will be added through the cycle but still frustrating to be repeating the same courses after only a week of play.

The main modes I have played in previous EA SPORTS Golf titles are always the Be a Pro and Online Tournaments.  I love being able to create a crazy looking golfer, build him up, and take him online in tournaments versus my friends.

Sadly you are left with very few choices for your created golfer this year.  All of the choices are very mundane (standard), you have to actually make your character look like a golfer which is fine for some but many like to add some flair to their golfer.  The lack of customization in Be A Pro is near the top of my list for most disappointing aspects of this title.

Another area that isn't up to par in the Be A Pro career mode also deals with missing features.  The lack of a tour calendar this year is highly annoying.  No longer can you look ahead or skip ahead to the tournaments you want to play.

One glaring omission on the links in career mode is that we are still missing a playoff when golfers are tied atop the leaderboard at the end of each tournament.  This is an item I thought they would have in this year for sure.  Playoff situations that can add a ton of fun and pressure are now just a flip of the coin.

Online Play

Not much going on here as you can play head to head online or join weekly/daily tournaments.  The real kicker is that its only stroke-play, no best ball, scrambles, or skins.  The lack of customizable tournaments is a killer as well.  Many of us were expecting to make our own tournaments that we could play amongst friends with our own custom settings.

Thats a tough pill to swallow in the online world.  Also another glaring omission is Country Clubs.  Being able to team with groups of your friends and play the way you want to is crucial to online golf.  It is sorely missed.

Nightclub Challenge

If you have played the EA SPORTS Golf mobile game this is very similar.  Its a linear arcade challenge based mode.  Basically there are several types of challenges including hitting a bullseye style target, breaking glass panes, using a remote-controlled ball through cricket style gates, and many others.

Nightclub Challenge is a different experience that allows for some quick change of pace fun.  Really a decent addition to the game and something that will keep the casual player in the game.

Final Thoughts

While EA SPORTS Rory McIlroy plays a very good game of golf, there really isn't much to it.  Sure we have been told this isn't a yearly title and will be built upon post launch but that doesnt change what we have now.  I will certainly continue to play because the game play itself is VERY good.  But we need some meat and potatoes added to these game modes.  Until then I give it a 6.5/10.",EA SPORTS Rory McIlroy Shoots a Bogey in Round 1,1437350400,3,{'Format:': ' CD-ROM'},
3.0,False,"03 16, 2009",A1250POFZL8U1B,B0017XFP8G,Plague11,"As many other reviewers of this game, I'm a long-time fan of the AC titles and was also disappointed when they decided to drop Sony.  Very few flight games have found their way onto the PS3 and I think that this game missed a golden opportunity to really shine.  As I mentioned in the title, this game is good, but not great.  It may have gotten a few extra bonus points for being the first modern jet game for the PS3, but you'll have to judge for yourself.

The Good - This game has an amazing selection of aircraft, including some pleasant surprises.  The cockpits are all well done from what I've seen (I've used about 20 different aircraft thus far) and the aircraft themselves are also look pretty good.  The missions are slightly more reality based than many in the AC series (real jets, ships, tanks, etc), and is, overall, a lot of fun.  The game is easy to get into with a fairly low learning curve and is quite addicting.  Also, GeoEye did an outstanding job of integrating real imagery, even though it isn't the highest resolution and really starts to pixelate at less than about a thousand feet.

The Bad - For starters, this game is S-H-O-R-T!  With a grand total of 19 missions, none of them lasting more than about 15 minutes, you can easily beat this game 2 or 3 times on a Saturday afternoon.  The experience points process is an interesting approach, which does help with replayability, but I would rather have seen the accumulation of money instead since you are, essentially, a mercenary.  I enjoy unlocking planes and being able to purchase what you want.  As good as the graphics are, they are lacking in a few areas as well.  The aircraft are pretty good, but I don't think they took advantage of what the PS3 is capable of.  The jets in Ace Combat 6 on the Xbox definitely look better, which is sad considering the game is almost a year and a half old.  One thing that especially bugged me was the afterburner flames - they are essentially orange ellipses.  I think a few old PS2 games, including Aero Elite, did a better job of rendering them.  Not just that, but some jets, most notably the A-10 (I haven't used any of the other sub-sonic aircraft) don't even have afterburners, so I found it a little ridiculous.  Also, they got at least one name wrong - the ""Mig-25"", is actually a Mig-31.  I know this is nit-picky, but come on!  There is also no real sense of speed, which is particularly evident with low-level flying.  The ability to land aircraft would also have been a nice option, but oh well.

In conclusion, when I first started playing this game, I might have even given it five stars.  After 4-5 hours of gameplay it would've dropped to 4.  Now that I've beaten the game and started reflying missions just to accumulate XP, it's dropped to a 3.  I still own Aero Elite and Ace Combat Zero for PS2 and in 6 months will almost certainly prefer playing them to this game.  Ubisoft gets a B for effort and a C for delivery.

Origin: EA's dream of Steam is a steaming pile of worthlessness. I get weekly updates that ""will take just a few minutes"", when all I want to do is play this one, single game. So you wait while Origin's Steamwannabe patches or boots up. Then game time? No, of course not! Then your browser, the one with the non-optional plugin you were forced to install, boots up and takes you to the website. In game browser? No, that would not eat up nearly enough resources or be nearly as invasive! So you get in there. Let's say you just want to play the single player game. You've not had to wait for Origin to open and probably patch, then go to the web browser, then you can actually click ""single player game"" and play the game you have already decided might have been a mistake. Minutes later, you get into the game.

So far I've had floating bodies, and a fallen tree that disappeared as I passed it, only to have an enemy pop out of the now no-longer-there tree and stab me.

I fired maybe 10 rounds, and running...following...running...fire 4 rounds, jump down, fire a few more, have the fallen tree disappear and get stabbed. I got half way through and had to stop.

I did give this game an extra star for the ""how fun is this"" if only because they kept Punkbuster, unlike the COD people, and the multiplayer isn't too bad. But after forced to start Origin (a store front pretending to be DRM), then go to the website (hey look, another storefront!), then into the game...nah, I'll just load up COD4 or Arma2, Far Cry 3...or heck, anything other than this disaster.

It introduces a gameplay style that has never been done before, and the action is incredibly intense, and nearly non-stop, for the duration of its 8 hour campaign.  But one thing I learned while playing this game, is that when you have the masters of the medium, Platinum Games, behind the helm, you can rest assured that you're going to have a great action experience that is not only expertly crafted, but unlike anything you've ever played before.

Vanquish is a cover-based, sci-fi third person shooter with a major twist...that twist being your ability to travel at incredibly fast speeds from place to place using your suit's boost power.  The game is structured in a way that if you stay in one place for too long, enemies will either flank or destroy your cover, so if you don't keep moving, you won't remain alive for very long.  In addition to the boost, the suit's enhanced reaction abilities allow you to seemingly slow down time in order to get precision shots with your weapons.  Both the boost and slow motion abilities use your suit's cooldown powers, so the entire game is a balancing act of not overheating your suit while causing as much destruction as possible as you move from place to place at a high speed.  Combine this with an outrageous scenario involving evil Russians on a giant space station , along with with a high pace of action that makes a Michael Bay movie look like ""The English Patient"", and it seems like something like this just wouldn't be able to come together without turning into a huge mess of a video game.  But Vanquish couldn't be further from that.

Vanquish has some of the tightest controls I've played in any video game.  And it is due to these controls that the gameplay is able to come together so well.  Early on in the game, after going through a well made tutorial, you'll be thrust into a battle that will quickly teach you what Vanquish is all about.  You'll likely die more than a few times, but what the game smartly does is it forces you to learn how to properly play the game.  You'll not only learn that taking cover will only protect you for a brief, fleeting moment, but you'll also learn how awesome your suit's powers are.  You'll realize you don't really need the cover system too much, as you quickly learn how to harness your suit's powers bring down mobs of enemy robots in ways that will make you feel incredibly powerful.  Once you get into Vanquish's rhythm, the game is pure joy.  You'll become nearly untouchable. Also, you'll start to notice into the smaller details, like the intriguing story, the very cool, upgradable weapons that become available to you, and the different tactics required to take certain enemies down.  As it all came together for me, I realized that I was playing the most tightly-crafted, well-working shooters I'd ever played.  Not only that, but the game looks fantastic, and has an awesome soundtrack to boot.

Platinum Games, following up on their incredible achievement that is Bayonetta, has really delivered the goods with Vanquish.  It is innovative, action packed, and incredibly fun to play.  Like Bayonetta did with action/beat em up games, Vanquish has really upped the ante in the third person shooter genre, and given it its own unique spin that stands apart from the rest of the pack.  It's a shame that this game didn't catch on more than it did when it released in late 2010, as it's truly an underappreciated gem in the PS3/360 catalogue, but I think time will be kind to this game's legacy.  If you love fast-paced shooters and want to play a truly innovative entry into the genre, don't miss out on Vanquish.

I'm sure it was because he is a loving son, and had nothing to do with the fact that he was able to spend hours playing Guild Wars 2 with my blessing. So, my review is from the point of view of someone unfamiliar with MMORPG games. I'll do my best to review it.

First off, the graphics in a game are very important to me and what I saw in Guild Wars 2 was terrific. If the graphics do not wow me, I generally do not like a game. I really like the variety of areas in the world and the amount of detail. And, there's a snowy area- my favorite- as well as areas with interesting vegetation and architecture. Often, I was reminded of the later Myst graphics or even the architecture in Dinotopia. (OK, I'm dating myself here!)

You have several choices of characters to play as, each very different from another and having many options as to looks, as well as what job you hold. I'm coming from the world of adventure games where you are pretty much play as what the game is designed for you to be, so with Guild Wars 2 that's pretty cool. And, with the game changing in response to what you do, that promises for many, many hours of play.

As for playing... Well, I must admit that I cannot do shooters. If it involves more than moving a mouse and clicking (slowly, at that) I'm toast.  So, I had to watch in amazement as my son battled some very nasty looking critters. He said movement and abilities are controlled via the WASD  and keyboard, and the mouse controls attacking and your view, and that movement is typical of MMO games. Further, he commented that an experienced player would have no problem, however anyone new to MMOs (like me) would probably need to read up a bit and watch a few videos to learn about them first.

My attempts at an MMO were short, confusing, and not pretty, but my son assured me that the game's controls were neither clumsy nor difficult to play. I'll have to take his word for it because to me it looked like there was a lot to keep track of, what with skills, attributes, weapons, etc. and a lot going on at once.

I like the fact that once you buy the game, you can play it without forking over money every month just to play a game you've already bought. Seems to me, though, that there should be a way to play the game by yourself, and not have to hook up online with others online.

So, I guess for those who like MMOs, then Guild Wars 2 will be enjoyable and easier on the wallet than some of the other games out there, and it will provide many hours of play in an interesting variety of places. Happy gaming!","Beautiful places to visit, no subscription fee.",1365292800,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
3.0,False,"11 4, 2011",A19XXPC6EU4B35,B00269DX5W,Johann Grimm,"In brief: This game is designed to have a certain ""play time"" it does this with a lot of tedious tasks rather than being fun that whole time.  But it's in an outstanding backdrop, with pretty good voice acting, decent action, and fairly fun all around.
I'm a demanding consumer, and when I fork my cash over I expect a lot in return and Assassin's creed 2 was a bit of a disappointment, less so then Assassin's creed 1 as many of the incredibly tedious jump puzzles can simply be skipped (along with their rewards) if you'd rather avoid them.  And after this I'll be giving up on the franchise.  Jump puzzles and fake chases are deliberately added to waste time, which could be argued is a form of temporary murder. It's not wrong to include them but if the majority of your ""game"" is a frustrating interface and hobbling you have a design problem. Don't get me wrong, Assassin's creed 2 is an order of magnitude better than any Drake's fortune game in that the illusion of options is generally well maintained and mediocrity is well disguised.  The window dressing does a great job in this case, with very good voice acting, nice cut scenes, interesting stories with contrived plots, cool outfits and weapons (more important than you might think), and an amazing amount of detail in cities (my favorite part).  I actually like to run around the cities because they generally do a great job with it's recreation.  I've been to all the cities in this version of the game and have to say that it's reminiscent enough that it took me back to my own memories of the places especially Florence.  The combat is pretty decent, but honestly it feels a lot like button mashing a lot of the time (Square, square, R1+square, square, square, square . . .) and the experience is greatly improved by the animations and kill shots for me which I just love.  Assassinations are always fun too as the player can generally choose to plan them out or run in guns blazing if that's your style.  But transparently contrived sequences will always annoy me.  In Pac man I know I'm limited to the predefined grid so it never surprises me to be confined to it throughout the game, but I'd be very pissed if on level 20 a wall appeared right in front of a powerball I was about to grab.  In Assassin's Creed 2 there are frequently times when you realize that throwing daggers would be perfect for this situation, but they're grayed out JUST for this sequence because the developers don't want you to use them just here where they'd be perfect.  Find yourself surrounded by enemies?  Smoke bombs are grayed out on this mission.  Other than using throwing daggers on thieves and archers, I was never able to use them as described.  Never used Smoke bombs either, the one time I felt I needed them they had no effect.  I ended up with a lot of unused supplies.  Then there are the chase scenes where the guy is WAITING for you to chase him, or where he suddenly gets a 200' lead for unknown reasons, or how you can fail a tail because you're waiting a head of where you think he'll be (first run through) rather then where he's waiting for you to be.  And on and on.  If the hidden blade can always give a fatal counter attack, but they can miraculously avoid the counters from more practical fighting weapons, why ever use the real weapons? Why can't I keep the rapier I picked up from a guard and use it permanently, must I really buy an identical weapon myself? Why are there wanted posters in places where only the wanted can reach them?  And lets not forget the jump puzzles, the kind where you have to make 3+ jumps of varied complexity exactly correctly and sequentially or restart the whole processes which takes 5 to 10 minutes.  Or Accidently fall and not die and be forced to go back to the point before all your check points with no other way to kill yourself or load the last check point(a process that should take zero seconds).  A lot of this can be ignored, forgotten, or given a pass because the genre pulls this crap all the time, but I expect more from my video games.  If you like all that BS, more power to you enjoy the game, but games don't have to be like that and I don't think they should be.  Assassin's Creed 2 is not amazing, but it is a solid game.  The pickpocket was an inspired idea, I hate those guys so much I would go out of my way to kill them (well done on that developers!).  The addition of hirelings was also a nice touch, so when you're sick of counters not working as you expect you can just hire some thugs to distract the opposition while you continue with what needs to be done.  The villa aspect was interesting as well, but felt poorly developed.  I understand that having a lot of money can be ""game breaking"" but it's my game let me break it if I want to. Other slight faults include shops that automatically replace your current load out while the game encourages collecting, and in this way collecting inhibits game playing.  A lot of these observations and demands for improvement come from having played a lot of video games but now finding less time for them raising the bar of ""worth playing"".  The rest of it is from playing games from Bethesda game studios (not the softworks), and seeing games from 2009 continue to fail to meet a bar that was 2006.",Adventure gaming isn't what it used to be.,1320364800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I've most recently played World of Warcraft and Guild Wars; I was looking for a similar experience in a more D&D-based world. I hoped DDO would be the game for me--a MMO-version of Neverwinter Nights. It wasn't.

Everything about this game is substandard and disappointing. The graphics are very dated and the animation isn't terribly smooth. Beyond the first few quests, there is no possible way to solo. Characters only get XP from completing quests...as boring and repetitive as they are. Monsters rarely ever drop items. The game does not explain the skills or spells well at all (and this coming from someone not alien to the DnD world).

In addition to all this, I have problems staying connected to the server. It seems like every 15 minutes I get disconnected, and this is something I don't experience in any other MMORPG I play. The technical support/customer service is especially poor as well.

And with DDR Max, now you can in the comfort of your very own living room.  Lord knows in these days of McDonalds, its a wonderfull day indeed when you can play a video game, and lose weight.  DDR Max does away with the dancing characters, and puts in a new twist, Music videos.  The music has also greatly improved in this version (as opposed to Konamix) and in my opinion, the game itself is much more challenging.  There are 4 modes of difficulty, Light; Standard; Heavy and the ""secret"" mode (I call it secret because I had no freakin' idea it was there, and found it accidently) Challenging mode, wich is flippin' hard.
One of the many great things about DDR is its more like playing an instrument, than playing a video game, its not really something you get tired of all too quickly, so paying 60 bucks for the game and pad isn't really that bad, if only because the games replay value is so high.
There really isn't any better feeling than beating a super-hard-psychotic song in this game, especially when there are witnesses all around.  And I think there is something to be said for the fact that this game is amazing for parties, and get-togethers.  Now, granted, its not the best thing videogame wise, and every new release isn't much more than a ton of new songs, but thats all part of the fun.  My only complaint with the regular dance pads is that the bunch up under feet sometimes, and that gets really annoying, but there is a platform you can buy if you don't mind sinking the 70 bucks in to get it.

There's nothing too deep here in the way of story or character elements.  Its more about having fun in many different types of challenges and game worlds, with an emphasis on building your own vehicles in order to conquer your current challenge or objective.  Add to that some excellent bright and colorful graphics, and you have a great game overall.

Pros: Game is just FUN -- Creating your own vehicles is a blast and gives the user unlimited possibilities -- Still a decent amount of old fashioned platforming -- Great graphics -- Retains alot of the loveable traits of the old banjo games

Cons: Creating vehicles, while the interface is easy, could be pretty daunting for young kids -- If you get frustrated easily with losing and retrying challenges, you might want to steer clear -- The game overall is a tad difficult, which again could turn younger gamers off

Overall I'd definitely recommend this game to people of all ages, but I'd advise to be careful with younger children as they might find the gameplay and vehicle creator difficult.  Luckily, if you are devoid of imagination or just lazy, the game throws a multitude of custom built vehicles at your that will serve just fine in all of the challenges.

It really has held up well and has protected my Vita. It's quite impressive actually. But I can't stand how the upper flap is layered still; it's still unusable.

----------
Original review:

Generally, it does what it says. It carries the PSVita and protects it from harm. I've dropped it once on concrete on accident and nothing was harmed. It gets the job done.

However, I'm not happy with [mostly] everything else. The carabiner that was suppose to come with it, didn't even fit in the small loop. I've tried shoving it in, but nope. Doesn't fit at all (so I left it in the box). The top ""level"" where all the games and memory cards, etc go is tucked into the case in such a way that it always flaps into the top. Some pockets for the memory cards are sown into mesh. This makes no sense whatsoever. They could have put a zipper instead of open pockets so that the games,etc won't fall out. I also would NOT recommend putting earphones in it. There is just not enough space because of the flapping ""layer.""

When the Vita is in the case and strapped in, you can't push the L or R buttons. I really wish it did so I could at least play on it while it's in the case.

On the center that holds the top and bottom together, I can see some parts already being undone. I've had it... almost 3 weeks now?

For the price of it right now, ~$8-ish, it's decent. It does it's job. If you have a few extra dollars to spend, I'd probably get a better one.

The case I received didn't have that dreaded smell, so that's a good thing.

Edit (5 Feb. 2013): I'm lowering this to 2 stars because I suspect that it's scratching my PSVita's screen. About a week into use, I noticed 3 0.5-1 inch long cuts on my screen (luckily I had a screen protector) and it had to have come from the case. If they got rid of that layer on top, I think it would have been fine.

Edit (19 Mar. 2013): I'm actually surprised that this case has held up for so long. There hasn't been any major rips or tears or anything like that. As for the case being too small to hold the Vita, I made a quick adjustment that seems to have done the trick. Instead of putting the Vita inside (the right way up), I put it in upside down so that it sits on the top flap. This method stops the two ""joysticks"" from being smashed since the system is being held up by the two cords when the case is closed.","I'm not impressed, but I'm not too dissatisfied.",1356393600,,{'Style:': ' PS Vita - Textured'},
4.0,True,"06 17, 2010",A3S3R88HA0HZG3,B003GZY88G,PT Cruiser,"Are you the kind of person that can't listen to a Broadway soundtrack without tapping your foot and bopping out in your chair?  Do you want to get some exercise without even realizing you're working?  If you're anything like me, I think you'll like this game.  Remember the dancers in the Broadway hit, ""Fame"", dancing their hearts out to that great song?  Or the dancers in ""All That Jazz"" doing that cool tap dancey thing?  Well, this isn't quite as complicated as all that but its lots of movement and fairly easy choreography that you follow along with while the Wiimote records your moves.  You can play with up to four people.  You choose one of four characters that you would like to be at the beginning, when you choose the song.  There are 20 songs, some of which are:

* ""All That Jazz""
* ""Aquarius""
* Caberet
* Luck Be a Lady
* Lullaby of Broadway
* ""Bend and Snap""
* ""One Night Only""
* ""Dreamgirls""
* ""Time Warp""
* ""Fame""
* ""We're in the Money""
* ""Let The Sunshine In""
* ""You Can't Stop the Beat""
* ""Little Shop of Horrors Theme""
* My Favorite Things
* And there's more....

The idea of the game is to follow your chosen dancer, like in a mirror image, with dance, rhythm and arm movements.  One of the options is to set it so you see the words to the songs at the top of the screen and they're highlighted, kind of like a bouncing ball but without the ball, so you can sing along.  There really isn't any recording of your voice so it's just kind of for your own amusement.  When choosing a song, you see a difficulty level and an effort level shown by the number of stars.  Several of the songs are at a somewhat slow pace so it's pretty easy to follow along.  There are some little icon figures that move along the bottom that show upcoming moves.  I found it easier just to watch the dancers. The game does a reasonably good job of recording your movements and you can see with a gauge above your dancer whether you've missed the move ""X"", got an ""OK"" or a ""Great"".  It's possible to get combo points by scoring several ""Greats"" in a row.  Your points are totaled up at the end in each category.

Ok, so why did I give this game only 4 stars if I like it so much?  Well, I just got the game today and after playing it for a couple hours I'm already scoring pretty well.  It's not that I'm really good at this sort of thing, in fact I'd have to say I'm pretty uncoordinated most of the time.  It's just that I like games that are more challenging and I want to get a lot of hours of enjoyment out of it.  Now I do have to say that I really, REALLY had fun playing with it tonight.  I love the music, the graphics are pretty good and I just like the whole idea of the game.  But I'm not sure a couple of weeks from now that I'll be challenged enough to be looking forward to playing it as much.  I always compare this type of game to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Cheer/dp/B0017ZK7PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Cheer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Cheer-2/dp/B0028A6VDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Cheer 2</a>, by Namco.  Those are  rhythm games as well, kind of on the same principle, but I couldn't even get past the first song for over a week.  I played those games for hours and hours trying to open new levels of songs and stages. (I still have fun playing them). With Dance on Broadway, there are 20 songs and as far as I can tell, everything is accessible right away, no additional challenges or hidden things to open.  Some of the songs like All That Jazz and Aquarius are very easy to score on because of the way these games record the Wii movements.  Now, if you want to follow along with the steps and really look like the dancers on the screen it will be more difficult. But this game, like others of it's type records only your arm movements to score.

So would I buy the game again?  Yeah, I love the music and I'm a sucker for rhythm and musical type games.  But I wish it had more levels and was more challenging.  The challenge for me will be not so much the scoring, which I think I'll probably be able to ace in a fairly short time, but trying to really copy all the footwork and look like the dancers onscreen.  And while it's not as energetic as some games like We Cheer, my arms are sore after playing it for a while.  I'm not exactly huffing and puffing but it's still good exercise.  I just wish Ubisoft would have added a little more interest and more levels to this game.  It's good as far as it goes but seems as though it was rushed to market too soon.

Update 6/27/10 - After playing with this game for 10 days I'm finding that the motion sensing is sometimes a little quirky.  It doesn't always pick up the motions of the Wiimote as quickly as it should.  But we've also had some really big fun with this game when we had friends over.  After a couple glasses of wine we started up the game, and after watching, had 4 people playing at a time and it was hilarious!  Watching a line of ""dancers"" make their Broadway debut with exaggerated dance movements and expressions was way funny.  And trying to outdo each other on the points kept everyone playing for a long time.  Because there are a lot of easy dance numbers like the one from ""Hair"" or ""All That Jazz"" everyone can score reasonably well after just a few tries.  And there are definitely some that are more difficult and energetic.  So I have to give the ""party potential"" 5 stars even though I rated the game 4 stars for the rest.",Get up off the couch and make your Broadway debut!,1276732800,73,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"10 23, 2005",AF3RMNRNRSG7W,B00006C2HA,Brynn Huxtable,"I played this game about 9 months ago (January 2005) and quite frankly, it was a great First Person Shooter in my opinion. Now I've played a ton of FPS games in the past, and I'll be honest - this game isn't as good as the Half-Life Series. That's just one of the greatest FPS Sagas ever conceived I'm afraid. But nonetheless, ""Doom 3"" is fantastic and is sure to scare even the hardiest and merciless FPS Veterans. On to the review...

Mars. The 22nd Century. You play a Marine brought in to assist in security operations on a Top-Secret Research Facility on the Red planet. However, when you land you are warned to leave the planet immediately by a seemingly paranoid scientist. Ignoring this, you continue on your path and get straight to work. You are subsequently given your first assignment to find a missing scientist - and upon finding him, all hell breaks loose. You are then flung into a world of hideous monstrousities, demons and darkness as you fend for your very life in the besieged facility. The storyline borrows from the older ""Doom"" games and evidently also ""Half-Life."" The storyline's a bit formulaic, but it's good enough for me: hey, it's an FPS, not a Strategy or Role-playing game! So ""Doom 3"" gets 7/10 for its storyline.

The gameplay is great, there's no doubt about that. You'll constantly find yourself interpolating between your weapons arsenal and flashlight as you navigate the dark and ominous corridors of the UAC Facility. It's a far more realistic approach to combat, though you'd think that your armour would have a built-in flashlight. Still, it makes for some terrifying combat and scary-ass conflict. The guns range from small to f****** big, so you get your standard loadout as such. And you can carry every single gun too, which is impossible, but fantastic! The gameplay is fast and horrifying, and you'll constantly find yourself backing up and firing at hulking figures and at times running the hell away from some enemies. I reckon the gameplay's flawless and so it gets 10/10 in my book.

The Graphics are stunning, or so I think so. The ambient lighting is fantastic, the details on the environments, characters and weapons are fabulous and the effects are simply jaw-dropping. And the game's supposed to be dark and foreboding, and the environments are a reflection of the games' atmosphere. There are blood-stains on the walls, totally dark areas, dimly-lit corridors, a hazardous and toxic planet surface and eventually you even go to hell! Woohoo! Now THAT'S entertainment! 10/10 for the graphics.

Now how's about a look at your weapons eh? Basically your weapons range from your fists and a standard issue 9mm Pistol to firearms like the mighty plasma gun and devastating BFG (which can fire individual blasts of plasma or one charged ball of furious death at your enemies.) It's all alot of fun to sucker punch zombies using your fists (I live for punching zombies!) and if one pi$$es you off, just hit him with a flashlight. Maybe that's not your game, but messing with the undead is just heaven (ironically). There are plenty of weapons to keep you happy and even an artifact that's great for not only killing enemies, but restoring your health too. Once again ""Doom 3"" gets 10/10 for weapons.

Now for the enemies. Basically they range from your common garden-variety zombie (both thin and fat-a$$ed) to your almighty Hell-Knight and Arch-Vile. Zombies are easy to kill and the most fun to destroy. Then Imps are evil looking creatures that throw fireballs at you and also have a nasty claw attack - may I suggest a Shotgun for killing these guys? My personal method is to walk right up to them and blow a hole in their face. It's a very effective attack. Then you get these flying disembodied heads called Lost Souls. They are excruciatingly annoying, especially in groups. Use a pistol for 3 and under, and a machine-gun for any more than that. Then Cacodemons (that look simliar to those Octopuses in ""Duke Nukem 3D."") Float around and fire plasma blasts from their mouths. Suggested weapons: machine-gun for 2 and under, and either a chain-gun or plasma gun for more than that. Then you get these Double-Headed Demons called Maggots - they're incredibly weak and usually 1 or 2 shotgun blasts send them back to hell. Then there are these Spider-Creatures (called Wraiths) that can appear and re-appear. They're also terribly weak. Wait for one to get next to you, and as he lifts his mandible, blow his head off with a shotgun shell. Then you get these small-spider things (both adult and juvenile, the former known as Trites and the latter as Ticks) - use a machine-gun or pistol on them - they're weak but DEADLY in groups. Then there are Cherubs that are also weak but highly aggressive. I prefer a shotgun for a couple of them but any other automatic weapon is preferable for more. Use your discretion. There are also Possessed Marines that use everything from pistols to shotguns to machine-guns. I like to use equal force on one enemy, but a plamsa gun or chain-gun is ideal for more than that. Commando Demons are soldiers who have been taken over and mutated by Doctor Malcolm Betruger. Some will run at you and use a tentalce attack on you, others fire chain-guns. They're dumb and aggressive, much like the Jocks at you high school. I suggest a Chain Gun or Plasma Gun on these guys. Revenants are skeletal in nature and fire shoulder mounted rockets at you. I say Plasma Gun first and in open areas (such as the planet surface) use a Rocket Launcher. Pinky Demons are quadrupedal and are relatively weak. Shotgun all the way I say. Mancubus' are fat and grotesque and fire massive plasma blasts from two huge cannons. They're basically immobile - use any big gun, including the BFG on these guys. And if possible, just run away. Hell Knights are the big Kahunas in ""Doom 3."" Like Imps, they throw plasma balls - just alot bigger. And don't get close, because you will be battered, bitten and smashed to pieces by these lumbering behemoths. The weapon choice is easy - the bigger the gun, the better! Arch Viles cast spells to summon other demons and also create trails of fire which absolutely destroy you. Kill these guys first! Use a Plasma Gun or Rocket Launcher on them. Those are your basic enemies, but you'll face bosses like The Vagary (which comes back later on in the game as a common enemy), The Sabaoth, The Guardian and the Absolutely massive and awe-inspiring Cyberdemon. The enemies are so diverse and numerous that ""Doom 3"" deserves 11/10 in my book!

In terms of difficulty, ""Doom 3"" can be pretty tough in some places. But Veteran is passable and Nightmare can be completed (ask me, I did it!). I suggest that veterans of FPS games play on the Veteran setting and then the Nightmare setting, and newbies should play the Marine setting. ""Doom 3"" gets 10/10 for difficulty on the Nightmare setting, 8/10 on Veteran, 6/10 for Marine and 5/10 for Trainee. ""Doom 3"" also gets 7/10 for lastability (without Multiplayer capabilities) and 9/10 for consumers with access to High Speed Internet connections and LAN Networks.

Overall ""Doom 3"" scores a solid gold 92%. It's dark and foreboding, action-packed, riddled with blood thirsty enemies and bosses and possesses all the necessary components for an FPS classic! It's not the greatest FPS I've ever played and not the scariest game either, but ""Doom 3"" has a fine balance of both crucial elements. So I would definitely recommend it to all serious FPS players, but there again, there are some fans who apparently haven't enjoyed ""Doom 3."" But that aside, I certainly enjoyed it and the Expansion Pack, although short, was alot of fun. So go on, buy it, borrow it or steal it today, but at least give it a decent chance before you judge it.

5.0,False,"11 1, 2014",A1S0JX45650UMY,B00DHF3BZQ,Jeffrey Lasalle,"For years, many niche genre's were being suppressed by the flood of first person shooters that dominated last generation. Survival horror attempted to adapt, by shifting the focus away from horror, and closer to something resembling Call of Duty or Gears of War. Recent installments of Resident Evil and Dead Space serve as prime examples, of compromised integrity and identity, in the interest of attaining mass appeal.

Some quick background on me:

Survival horror is my favorite genre. I am in my 30's, and have very fond memories of playing Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Fatal Frame (etc) during my high school years. Watching the genre slowly erode, and fade away, was very disheartening. There were only a handful of legitimate horror games last generation (Siren: Blood Curse being my favorite). Most were just gory action fests.
However, the genre has been going through a resurgence, through the independent scene on PC in recent years. I had my fingers crossed that this would spill over onto consoles, and it finally has...

The Evil Within

When Shinji Mikami announced his intentions to return to survival horror, the genre that he helped define nearly 15 years ago, I was beyond thrilled. Finally, gaming could be rescued from first person shooter hell, and maybe we could have some diversity again. After anticipating The Evil Within for years, it has finally arrived, and here is my review...

As I reflect on my experience with the game, the most commendable aspect would have to be it's pacing. It really does a masterful job of balancing tension building, resource management, and action. The most obvious comparison is Resident Evil 4, and rightfully so. They share so many characteristics, especially as it relates to gameplay mechanics and environmental design.
Although, I do feel that The Evil Within is more concerned with maintaining it's horror sensibilities, and remaining firmly grounded in that genre. I love Resident Evil 4, but that game really pioneered this shift away from slower paced, methodical survival horror, and established a sub-genre that has become action horror.

Now, I want to be very clear that The Evil Within is not a return to traditional survival horror. I see it more as a blending of traditional, and modern action horror. But, it does retain enough classic elements, to where I feel comfortable using the survival horror label when describing The Evil Within. Slower paced, atmospheric areas are prevalent throughout the experience. The emphasis of resource management, and strategically dispatching enemies are essential to survival. The modern influences stem from a forgiving checkpoint system, and increased action segments in certain areas.

You play as Detective Sebastian Castellanos, responding to a call involving the primary location of the game, Beacon Mental Hospital. As you arrive with your partners by your side, you quickly realize that something has gone terribly wrong. And it is up to you to unravel the truth...

I want to avoid spoilers, so I will try to talk around the key plot points of the story, so I can illustrate some of the issues I had with it. First of which, there really wasn't much of a detailed story presence until the tail end of chapter 8. The first half of the game is very ambiguous, and I had no apparent motivation for progressing through the game, from a story perspective. Perhaps this was done to perpetuate feelings of confusion and uneasiness, but I often felt frustrated by it. Also, the main character Detective Castellanos is underdeveloped, and quite dull. There is some meaningful character development through documents you collect. But nothing from in game action, or dialog. The story is slow out of the gate, but does pick up steam a little past the halfway point. Ruvik is the antagonist, and has an interesting backstory. In fact, he is the most compelling character in the game, by far. The villain really steals the show here, and is quite menacing.

The gameplay feels like an enhanced template from RE4. The combat is visceral and exciting. Shooting ghouls in the leg, and burning them with matches once they hit the ground is very satisfying. There is a nice variety of weapons, and they are all fully upgradable, along with Sebastian's core abilities. This can be done with green brain gel, that you collect throughout the game. You cannot do this at your leisure though, as it can only be done in your hub area. You can travel there through select mirrors in any given level. When in your hub, you can save game progress, use keys to unlock items, or handle upgrades. I really enjoyed this aspect of the game.

The atmosphere can be very oppressing, especially when the psychological horror elements come into play. Shinji Mikami seems to enjoy toying with your sense of reality, and gradually building that sense of tension. I really appreciate horror games that understand the importance of mood and atmosphere, and knowing when to build the tension, then slowly pull back, and give the player some breathing room, only to pull the rug out from underneath them lol. The Evil Within is expertly paced, and the feeling of dread is always looming. I like that it isn't always trying to be ""scary"", because that is impossible to sustain through long durations. Players will adjust, and become numb to it. The most effective horror games succeed with proper pacing, and The Evil Within is triumphant in this regard.

Is the game scary?? This question has been tossed around quite a bit. Some say yes, while others say no. Which only serves to re-enforce my opinion... that this is all very subjective, and will depend on the individual. If you think it's a scary game, then you are not wrong in thinking so. If you don't, then you are not wrong either. What one person may find scary, another may not. I personally felt tense and uneasy throughout most of my playthrough, with genuine moments of feeling scared periodically.

PROS:

+ Delivering an experience that is representative of the genre. From mood and atmosphere, to resource management and methodical pacing. The Evil Within is a success.

+ Chilling enemy design all around. Laura was especially disturbing, and Boxhead is the stuff of nightmares lol.

+ Combat and weapon variety felt great. I like that stealth is also an option, much of the time. The progression system was implemented very well. This was just a fun game to play.

+ Sound design is top notch. It really added to the immersive qualities of the game.

+ A ton of environmental variety. At times, it may seem a bit jarring, but it does makes sense in the greater
context of the story. I really enjoyed it.

+ A lengthy campaign. My playthrough clocked in at over 24 hours. Though I take my time with games, and tend
to savor every little detail. Those looking to plow through the game, could probably do so in 13-15 hours.

+ New game plus option, with new weapons.

+ The Agony Crossbow is a beast of a weapon. With many different bolt types, that can be upgraded.

+ While the graphics are lacking, the general art design is phenomenal. From environments and character designs,
the amount of detail is impressive.

CONS:

- Many take exception to the mandatory letter boxing display. I also could have lived without this, as it
did obstruct my field of view.

- The story takes too long to get going, and I didn't care for the sequel bait ending. Also, your main
character is a bit of a bore.

- The final boss fight with Ruvik is absurd lol.

- I did notice frequent texture pop-in during cutscenes, and when environments were loading in. Most of the time, this
was rather minor. But on occasion, it was a little disorientating and obtrusive.

- The game does slightly disappoint visually, as the graphics seem high end PS3 caliber. This is a
cross-gen game though. People expecting next-gen graphics had unrealistic expectations, in my opinion.

- The puzzles require little to no thought. It made me wonder why they bothered including them at all, if there
was no intention to challenge the player.

- Those wishing for a return to traditional survival horror, may be disappointed. This is more of a hybrid
of traditional and action horror.

In Closing:

The Evil Within is at the top of this new horror movement. If you are a fan of the genre, and have felt largely ignored by developers, whom have been favoring the 12 year old Call of Duty fanbase for years, then this is your time to rejoice. The landscape is finally changing, as there are many horror games on the horizon in 2015. It's a great time to be a horror fan.

The game play takes some time but once you get it down you're good to go. There is a fair amount of back tracking though, so keep that in mind. The game also offers up two different players which you can play and depending on certain things you do the ending can be different. If you play both characters it could take you anywhere from 20-40 hours if memory serves me. Overall if you can get past the controls you'll probably really enjoy it.",Capcom!,1299024000,,,

God of War may appear to be a button mashing beat 'em up at first glance, but look deeper and you'll find one of the most richly produced and rewarding games made in the past decade.  You play as spartan warrior Kratos, and you're on a mission of revenge against Ares, the God of war.  Armed only with your dual wielding blades and a few magic tricks, you take on a horde of deadly enemies and participate in some of the most epic boss battles ever crafted; ranging from mythical creatures such as the Hydra, the Minotaur, and Cerberus.  The game is easy enough to pick up and play and the combo systems and moves are incredibly done.  The game's storyline and voice acting are incredible for a video game, as what seems like a routine revenge tale evolves into something much, much more.  Graphically, you are not going to find another PS2 title that looks this good.  These are some of the absolute best graphics to ever grace the system, and there's virtually no slowdown!  The sound effects and music score are also some of the best you'll hear in a video game as well.  As you no doubt know already, God of War is also one of the bloodiest and most violent games you'll play as well, and it earns it's Mature rating for it's content, so be warned.  All in all, as a more than sucessful start of a new franchise for Sony's money making machine, God of War is a masterpiece that belongs in every PS2's owner's collection, and by the time you beat it, you'll be begging for God of War 2.",The best original PS2 title in years,1149120000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I got a copy when I preordered Max Payne 3, as it gave me some Rockstar games credit and I decided to get this game, as I had play most of the other Rockstar games on sale.

I don't particularly regret the purchase, but neither am I that happy with it. The main feature of the game was supposed to be the facial expressions of the characters. Maybe I'm not that great of a people person, but for me they don't really do anything. I can't tell if they're telling the truth, lying or if I should doubt them, which are the three choices you get whenever you interview someone. If you get it wrong, they can hold back more information from you thus making solving your case even harder. The best thing to do is to use the evidence you have gathered. Which again can sometimes be unreliable. You have no idea what your character is thinking and sometimes it's confusing as to which piece of evidence to choose. You really need to choose the right piece of evidence too, because false accusations of lying can again hinder you solving each case.

Thankfully though, you can always ask the community or remove an answer. A sort of, 'Who Wants To Be a Millionaire' type deal where, if you're signed in to the Rockstar community thing, you'll have these options. They can be a real life saver, especially when going with your gut can sometimes lead you to the wrong answers. Connecting to the said community can be a pain though. When I first downloaded the game, I had to get an update and it wouldn't install properly. You just have to keep trying. Signing in sometimes doesn't work either. Even though I typed the correct username and password it still wouldn't let me in. Again, you just have to keep trying.

One of the good things about this game is it's presentation. The cut scenes, the dialog, voice acting and the environment and city around you all come to life with the way it's presented. There doesn't seem like there is much to do in the city though, except travel to your next case. You can choose to let your partner drive to the next objective, but that would mean missing out on random calls on your way there. These random calls involve stopping a crime in progress, it usually starts with a chase either on foot or in a vehicle, and most likely ending in a shootout or the bad guys simply giving up and you arresting them. There are about 40 something of these events in the game. You can do them all if you want, but they can get pretty repetitive.

I am also playing this game on PC with a 360 controller. As always with Rockstar games the controls are horrible. Rockstar can never make some intuitive controls and sometimes they can be frustrating, especially in a gun fight when you are trying to get into cover after sprinting there, except you just fumble around and get shot. Another frustrating thing, is that if you have to replay a case, the checkpoints are few and far between and you often find yourself starting from the beginning of the case all over again. The good thing is, the second time round you have all your evidence that you previously collected and this time you can make the right decisions and conversation choices. Finding evidence is also pretty easy. When you stumble upon something that might be of interest to the case, the controller vibrates (if you are using one) and you get a visual and audio clue as well. Sometimes some things are worthless but it is up to you to find and use the right pieces of evidence properly. The game doesn't just play itself for you.

If you want to enjoy this game, I say be prepared to deal with Rockstar's terrible control system and community system. Also don't have such high expectations of it. The game is fun and has an engaging storyline, but it's not going to be the most amazing experience you've ever had. I will say it wins points for originality though. The idea behind it is quite groundbreaking, if sometimes lacking the intuition and self explanatory nature that we come to expect with games these days.",Overhyped and Frustrating at times,1337644800,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC Download'}",

I've played GH3 many times over, and I've never gotten tired of re-playing most of the songs on that game. With the release of GH-Aerosmith, I was extremely excited to have ~40 new songs to play (although I'm only a moderate Aerosmith fan). After playing through the game, I am extremely disappointed GH-Aerosmith and cannot recommend it to non-Aerosmith fanatics.

Pros
- Great graphics, definite upgrade over GH3
- Good storyline, the live interviews were interesting, and it was cool to re-play some of Aerosmith's critical gigs
- The recognizable Aerosmith songs are quite fun to play (especially ""Walk This Way"", ""Love in an Elevator"", ""Living on the Edge"", and several others)

Cons (lots of them)
- Only 41 songs (in comparison to GH3's ~75 songs) - how can they justify the nearly equivalent prices of the two games?
- The obscure Aerosmith songs and the non-Aerosmith songs have almost zero re-playability. In my opinion, the guitar parts on these songs were repetitive and boring.
- Omission of key Aerosmith songs such as ""Dude (Looks like a Lady)"" in favor of some lesser, more obscure Aerosmith songs
- As indicated by other reviewers, the game is pretty easy, but worse, the guitar parts just aren't very interesting or fun to play.
- Star power is a disaster. In star power mode, the virtual audience claps (very loudly) to some random beat that does NOT correspond to the rhythm of the song. Never in the history of music has an audience (real or otherwise) had less rhythm! It is incredibly distracting to have contrasting beats on the same song...  GH3 did NOT have this same problem.
- The volume of the guitar track was inconsistent between songs. I had to adjust the guitar volume (Options menu) for each individual song to have optimal guitar audio. Again, GH3 did not have this problem.
- The timing of the notes in Expert mode seemed to be quite off (especially on ""Cat Scratch Fever"" and other songs). I had to introduce an audio lag (Options menu) to try and make the video notes and audio correlate. This was not a function of my TV, and GH3 did NOT have similar problems on my system.

In my opinion, the game-play of GH-Aerosmith is ""sloppy"" compared to GH3. Perhaps these problems are the result of rushing this product to market in advance of the upcoming GH-World Tour...  Anyways, if you're a die-hard Aerosmith fan and you aren't too concerned about game-play, then you'll enjoy this game.

3.0,True,"08 22, 2016",A1DW0AZIUCIVA,B00N3OELPU,Jamie K.,"have been using this Keyboard for a couple of months now and feel I can give an honest and quick review.

I have used MANY Logitech keyboards for many years. The good, is that the Keyboard lighting will help you if you are memory impaired like me, especially on games like ARMA that has MANY hey commands. Color coding has been proven to have fast brain association over any other type of memory tools. I can instantly look at a key and know what area of function it is for, then associate placement of key with actual function. There are enough programmable G-Keys to be useful in most games. Interactive programming from games can be useful, and is nice when supported. However, it is not supported in many games and I see it pretty much becoming a ""novelty"" or ""gimmicky"" selling point.

The keys and travel do feel ""plasticky"" and not as tight as I was hoping. However they do function well, but I feel they are far too loud for the material they are made from. Brown MX Cherry switches feel much better but are still a bit louder than these. BTW, the indentions in the keys is no big deal for me, I do think it has helped me overall keep my finger planted on the keys better. if you slide your fingers though you may not like it.

The interactive apps for your phone are pretty much a joke and there is only a handful of them at this point. so if you are thinking that you are going to get the SDK and developer the for games, think again..only the Developer does this, not you or Logitech. So if you think this is going to be a widely adopted feature..think again it will not be.

The thing I do love about the keyboard though is there is ZERO backlight bleed, and I can dim the LEDs as well, so if I want to play in the dark, the keyboard is not a distraction or glaring as MANY other lit keyboards cause.

I always use individual profiles for all my games, and have it auto load the profile, just like my joysticks and Voice Attack, It helps me greatly. I do recommend this keyboard if you can get it on sale, but I would NEVER pay the normal price for this keyboard because it does have a few shortfalls and gimmicks.

Fist of all the ARX doc is a piece of crap and pretty much useless after an hour of gaming. To no have a way of attaching USB power to your phone and for a keyboard that they had the audacity to ask $180 for is just a crime. At a minimum the ARX doc should have had a hole in the bottom of it, to feed through a power cable for your phone.

I also wish they would add a power saving function for the keyboard would be welcome because my computer is on 24/7 and I do not need my LEDS burning out. an Away mode would be pretty cool as well as I could have it do a flashy show for friends. LOL

the seller got back to me offering me a refund or another headset for free. I don't want to deal with a return. It's too much work where I live when I can pinch it or jiggle a chord to fix it. I also am not comfortable taking anything without returning the original. The first pair I had I had no problems with and the only difference was color.

The only reason I had to replace the first pair is because where they plug in on the PS4 remote it causes a lot of bending at the cord. I reinforced this pair at the plug with electrical tape so it wouldn't happen again.

I don't change ratings when sellers contact me. This is the first time. This seller didn't seem shady. They asked if I wanted a replacement or my money back. They did not ask me to change my review.

Original:

This is the 2nd set I've bought. I liked the 1st set. The only problem was the PS4 controller. It hooked in on the bottom and the angle caused the wiring to pull apart. I can't blame the headset for that.

This pair was buggy from the beginning. The volume key was messed up somehow. I'd only get audio in the left ear unless I messed with the wiring that sits by the volume piece. I can't blame the PS4 remote for this since it started immediately.  I'd have to hit or pinch the piece to get sound in the right ear. If I shift a little the sound in that ear will cut out again. It's annoying.

I don't know if I should caution people about this or not. The 1st pair was great. Maybe I got a bad headset. Maybe I got lucky the first time.

Problem is, each setting has a color that goes along with it. This means that when you change to a different DPI preset, it changes the color of the mouse.

2.0,False,"11 16, 2010",ATR72FW8LEZV1,B002I0I85Y,C. L. Hanson,"I bought Flingsmash based on Nintendo's usually reliable track record of providing fun games with their first party controllers and periphials (Wii Sports Resort, Mario Kart Wii), with my decision also influenced by a July E3 preview on IGN.com where this game was called ""Span Smasher"" and sounded like the sleeper hit of the year. The fact that it came with the new Remote Plus made it also appear to be a great value.

That being said...if you gamble, sooner or later, you'll lose. Nintendo took a gamble that Artoon (developer of Yoshi's Island DS) could make a game to showcase the Remote Plus' abilities. I took a gamble that the game would be the hit that IGN said it would be. We both lost. Flingsmash simply does not work as intended, and could very well be the most disappointing purchase I've made for the Wii yet. The fact that Nintendo packaged this turd with it's Remote Plus makes me disappointed with them for not pushing themselves and Artoon harder to create a better gaming experience.

The premise is simple: you use the Remote Plus to smack the ""hero"" into boulders, prizes and enemies across a pre-determined course, trying to keep the character moving, as a 3 headed ""Hydracoil"" (dragon) is behind you. Collect 3 special coins scattered about the board, which transform into a pearl when you reach the end. Collect enough pearls and you face the ""Boss"" at the end of each stage and advance. As you progress, new action items appear such as cannons, spinners, tunnels...etc, and while it all sounds like a great amount of fun, it should be noted that the character seldom goes exactly where you want to smack him. This is not because I am ""holding the controller wrong"", or based on skill. I've played my fair share of Wii Sports tennis and other games where you hit objects and they go where intended.

As if graphics matter at this point, they are OK, showing a style reminiscent from Artoon's Yoshi's Island DS. The music and sound effects are by and large forgettable. The storyline is just there to give the character/game a purpose. Nintendo has made plenty of games with outside developers since the NES days, with silly storylines but solid gameplay. A good example was RARE's ""Cobra Triangle"". The most bizarre storyline ever, but a fun game. The only difference between ""Cobra Triangle"" and Flingsmash is that ""Cobra Triangle"" was fun.

If you need a new Remote Plus, this game is basically free. Without the Remote Plus, this game would most likely find good company in the discount bin.

I'll go ahead and go over the few good points first.
Graphics - the landscape/foliage is bad but the textures in the people and weapons are pretty good.
I never had any issues with phantom walls or clipping problems.
Although it is free roaming, it has these annoying blocks like, if you try to go into a tunnel, it just keeps flashing you back outside the opening. Even if your objective is in the doorway of the tunnel, it won't let you near it.
Bad:
This game has almost no real plotline, bad voice acting that just repeats and repeats, it crashes constantly and the bug reports are useless.
The weight restrictions on your character are more annoying than an interesting quirk that may have been added to make the game more realistic. It requires you to constantly return and sell 3-4 items at a time.
You will be told to go to collect your reward from the commander but the guides will not let you know where that is and the maps are not labeled so you are guessing if you are going to the right location.
There are pathetic wire fences keeping you from walking from one area on the map to another so you are forced to use the guides.
The game will tell you there's loot stashed somewhere and when you go to the location, it will be empty, or worse, you will pay 900 for a tip to a secret stash just to get a med pack and bandage?
The mutants, monsters, and enemies all look alike as well.
I was truly upset with the constant crashes, bugs and the poor plotline. I think I saw these exact same maps in the other games so it makes me think the designers were just too lazy to make a new game and just made the same game, using the same game maps.",Bugs and crashes plus bad story,1252281600,,,
4.0,False,"06 14, 2011",A1A629D04LRFUD,B004EDSBYQ,Spore,"I bought this headset yesterday from Fry's electronics, and here is what I think of it so far:

Sound Quality: For the price you pay, this headset actually has pretty good sound quality. It takes a little while to get used to, but the sound quality is pretty nice. There is actually some bass on these headphones too. I could feel a slight thump when I listened to various electronic songs, to test the sound. However, chances are you are buying these for gaming, not listening to music, so lets not get into that too much. For gaming, these are pretty decent. I tested them with various types of games. For FPS games, I used MW2 and Black Ops. Playing multiplayer, I noticed that the headset has okay sound staging. Just okay... Sometimes, I found it hard to figure out if the noise was coming from behind me or below me. Same with in front of me. However, I will say that you can hear footsteps VERY clearly with this headset on. Sound staging might not be the best, but for the price, I doubt you would expect phenomenal sound staging. As for left/right, those sound pretty good. For RPG's, these actually sound pretty nice. I used this headset while playing Final Fantasy XIII, and the in game music sounds pretty good, and you can really hear the sound of the lightning striking your opponent or your blade thrusting into your enemy. The only games which really require amazing sound staging are FPS games. If you are really into Xbox 360 FPS gaming, I would highly suggest the Tritton AX720 over these. Sure, they are $129.99, but the sound staging is phenomenal. For anything else, these headphones are really nice. As for the Earforce X11, just stay away from it. Those have absolutely no sound staging.

Build Quality: For the most part, these feel pretty solid. I was shocked at how light weight they were too! The part that goes over your head is padded with a soft white padding and it feels excellent. I'm sure if you tried to snap it in half it wouldn't be too hard, but it will be fine for people who don't throw their headphones across the room into a wall or something like that. The cups are surrounded by grey padding that is nice and soft. The cups also twist inward so you can rest it on your chest when taking a break. The cups also fold inward to adjust to your head size. The control pad is pretty cool too. At the top, you have your mute switch for the microphone. To the left side you have your audio volume. To the right you haveyour microphone jack input and the voice volume. The cable is made of plastic and isn't too heavy. I don't think the cable will be snapping anytime soon. The design looks very interesting and professional. I already got some compliments by friends!

Microphone: The microphone is detachable, which is perfect for me since I really do not enjoy talking to most of the Xbox live community, and since I usually don't play too many FPS games or games where you need to talk. I talked to some friends via Xbox live party chat and they told me the sound quality was pretty good. Also, I recorded a message and listened to it and the sound quality was pretty nice. The sound quality of the microphone is a lot better than that of the X11. However, I noticed that I need to speak a little louder than usual when using this microphone from my Xbox 360 Wireless Headset (Halo Reach Edition). It's only slightly louder, so it isn't a big issue. You need to talk about as loud as you talk when using the standard Xbox 360 headset that comes with your Xbox 360.

Setup: Setting up these headphones is pretty easy, whether you are hooked up via HDMI or RCA cables. I have my Xbox 360 hooked up to my monitor via HDMI, and I can still use these. Setup should not take longer than 5 minutes if you have used a headset like this before, but maybe 10 minutes if you are a beginner. Don't get overwhelmed by the amount of cables in the box!

Overall, this headset is probably the best you are going to get under $80 for your Xbox 360. The price to performance ratio is pretty good! Again, the Tritton AX720 has much better sound staging and overall sound quality, and I would definately recommend those over these if you are a hardcore FPS gamer. For light FPS gaming and other types of games, these should be fine. Just stay away from the Ear Force X11!

Eventually, after having his boat annihilated, Jack finds himself battling for his life on this island against pirates, mercanaries, and a mad doctor named Kreiger. Soon enough this Kreiger fellow gets a hold of you and injects you with some virus that transforms you into a lethal killing machine with abilities such as smelling people, seeing in the dark, super strength & speed, and the ability to jump great distances. Anyway, you basically have to kill Kreiger and the leader of the Mercanaries named Crowe and escape the island.

In Evolution, we find that Jack has been spending his time basically getting drunk when this young dame hires him as a muscle during a weapons sale between her and some local militia. Just as the sale is about to go down, some rebels come and obliterate the militia - and after you kill them - it looks like everyone is poiting the blame on you for the death of the militia. Anyway, your trying to escape from this new island when you get assaulted by people who have the same kind of powers as you, and the big cheese known as Sereum (or something like that) tries killing you and that dame from early... so naturally you want vengenace.... especialyl after he kills your man Doyle from Instincts.

Though different stories, both games play exactly a like. Through Jack's eyes you get a lot of weapons from assault rifles, shotguns, .50 caliber machine guns you can rip out of the ground, sniper rifles, and others to destroy numerous enemies - though you can only carry 3 types of weapons, most of the smaller ones can be duel wield. You can also use your animal moves which can be entertaining like when you punch a pirate 100 miles away. There are a lot of vehicles to drive such as hummers, ATVs, hand gliders (that was cool), various types of boats, trucks, and many more.. though there are no tanks. In both games you can set traps, which include laying claymore mines into the ground or tying up branches so when enemies walk near them the branch whips back scoring you an instant kill. It was pretty cool, but got pretty useless later on.

There is a multiplayer and it is pretty fun. There are many types of game modes ranging from mere deathmatches & capture the flag games to ""Predator"" games where one person becomes feral and stalks other players. There is also a map editor where you can make your own stages with any kind of box, vehicle, emplacement, or anything which is a really cool feature. Great for X-Box Live.

Lets talk difficulty. Far Cry Predator is a pretty hard game for a few reasons: You'll be fighting ALOT of enemies at one time (both in air and on ground), the weapons seem sort of weak when you're using them, and your health depletes WAYYY too fast - for instance you'll get shot like twice with an assault rifle and you're almost dead. However, the boss fights are pretty simplistic and just require you to slash at them with your claws for a few moments.. so its a win-lose situation: It's hard to get up to the boss, but the boss is easy.

Graphics are kinda subpar figuring they just used the normal X-Box mechanics, but they still look pretty good. The white beaches, dense jungles, dark caves, and crystal clear water look beautiful... the character models look a little lame and boxy, but one quick glance at the enviroments and you can easily forget about them.

Almost all of the sounds were great. The music was really thumbs up and helped add a bit of lonliness & freakyness to the atmosphere. The guns sounded great, and the voice acting was awesome - Jack Carver is the man. He curses, is sarcastic, tough... he has a lot of personality that is shown through his dialouge.

Now for endings. Instincts was boring - you beat Crowe, Kreiger gets killed by some mutants, Doyle & Cortez pick you up in a helicopter. You say, ""Cortez - you owe me a damned boat!"" and Doyle gives you a suitcase full of money. You grin and fly away.. thats it. In Evolution, after you beat the leader of the new Feral people (Sereum), you meet the dame who hired you and tried to kill you near the end of the game, and she starts freaking out because..well...she tried to kill you and you survived. You throw her money at her and she says,"" There was nothing else I could do Jack."" and your character looks at her and goes, ""There was a time when I used to think like that too."" and kicks open a door to reveal a way off the island. Thats it.... sadly, Doyle dies. Sort of lackluster, but every game's ending has been bad so far.

To finish it up Far Cry is a pretty run of the mill FPS with only a FEW qualities that make it stand out slightly. Sure its intense, and sure the multiplayer is good but the game is kinda short, the ending doesn't feel rewarding, and when your done with the stoy (and don't have X-Box Live) then there really isn't much reason to play Predator again.

Now I do believe having played the first three is important to understanding how great the game is, however this action/adventure games leaves a lot to love.

First off, the story is a true work of art giving time for the narrative back-and-forth that happens when Nate and other are just exploring the world. The characters evoke emotion and keep you curious of who may or may not come out on top. The graphics themselves make you stop and stare when playing on a good looking tv. Everything from the character models to the landscapes have an attention to detail that Naughty Dog always brings.

My only drawback is that I don't think players of only this game will appreciate the story all the way through. I believe that you will love the game but there are many nods to old adventures and characters that surface through the 9-12 hour adventure.

It's cheap, customizable, and has a wide variety of games including: Mario 64 DS, Animal Crossing DS, Mario Kart DS, and theres even some unique games that take advantage of the touch screen more than the others like ER: Under the Knife. [...] And the Silver DS is better than the others because you can actually sand it and it turns white for a nice coat if you wanna paint it. I painted mine Gold before the 90 day warranty was up and it was okay. I now have the only Gold DS around. PIMPED OUT! The DS has some other really cool and unique features like an annoying sounding alarm clock so your children can wake up in the morning, You can customise your DS Screen Name for Wi-fi Play and even change the color of your menu's and of your name's background Color. A great tool for the go. I don't think they will do this but I think they should make special DS cards that have a Spanish - English Translator that takes advantage of the MICROPHONE and Touch screen built into it so you can Ace that Spanish test when No ones looking. Oh did I forget to mention that the DS's Games are conveniatly built like small 1'' by 1'' micro-chip like cards. And you can even have a GBA game inserted while a DS card is inserted for the Double the fun. Remember those old Link Cables from the Gameboy years?

Cons are: Gameboy Color/GB games can no longer be played, You can't use Multiplayer on GBA games with the DS so in order to play multiplayer you'll need an older style of Gameboy, I blew my speakers out on mine somehow, After all these years Nintendo Still hasn't created technology that can withstand dust from going inside the screen, How gay, No Mp3 player, no PSP video, and I stuck normal sterio headphones in it once and after I used it without them the sound would't work anymore, Then I tried sticking the headphone jack in again and taking them out and it worked.

3.0,False,"11 9, 2009",ATR706NHU0N9X,B001IK1BWC,Shopp3holic,"This is a boring game. I was very excited to play this, because I have been in a search of a decent RPG game since I went overtime with Oblivion, but this game sucks!

Dragon Age depresses me greatly. Everytime I tried to play this, I exited the game feeling like I wasted my time in the worst way possible.

The combat is emphesized to be TACTICAL. All that really means is, I found out, you can pause anytime and order commands then unpause. Where is the fun in this? I would hate to waste my time playing a video game that requires no skill and delivers me no sense of urgency when there are other video games that challenge me in one way or another. I genuinely appreciate good game designs when I see them, but I found no aspect in this game that 'wow'ed me because everything about this game is so plain and linear. Either way, since combat is such a big part of the game, it would take a miracle for this game to be 'decent' at this point, but as you will see, that is not the case.

I cannot comment much on the story since I did not get very far in the game before I completely gave up. But the beginning story of the human noble I made (there are 6 different beginning stories that lead to the same story eventually) was very uninspired and was presented poorly. The demons are said to be coming back, and then a legendary Warden who hunts these demons comes in town, asks for your assistance, and the same day your father gets murdered by a betrayal of a friend that is linked with these demons. You be the judge of this...

The way the dialogue is played out, with you choosing from a number of response options to respond to what other characters say to you, becomes really tedious very quickly. I watched some trailer and it looked good, but was I wrong again... Most dialogue options you are given do not affect the outcome, but they may trigger a different verbal response from your target. That is about it... The dialogue options are boring and dull and I felt helpless that it takes so much time for the game to get going because of all the useless chat you have to do when you don't care about the history of a poorly built fictional world or the name of the warrior who saved the same fictional world a hundred years ago.

I read other reviews and am shocked that some people praise this tedious game by saying it is intellectual or tactical. I disagree. A lot of games today are tactical, but they're also fast-paced and require other skills (which I call video game skills), so the tactics involved in the process are not as obvious as this one's. Tactics found in this game are very shallow anyway. You pause when you get in a battle, you aim a faraway enemy with your archer, you use a spell or a skill when necessary, and you focus one unit at a time. You have unlimited time to tinker with these options...which makes this game even less rewarding as it is.

Bioware should fire the team who made this because I'm sure it's the same team that made Never Winter Nights, which is also a boring game. Try Mass Effect instead. That is a much better game made by Bioware.",Tedious,1257724800,15,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

The whole thing of being able to jump from one man to another is only confusing at best and lends nothing to being able to control the group.

During an outbreak at Fortune City, Chuck is framed for the release of the zombies causing the outbreak. Why would a horde of zombies only be secured by one weak fence, and how could they spread to all points of the map in seconds?... And why is there only apparently one emergency shelter in place for such an outbreak?...

...Uhm... moving on.

Dead Rising carry's over a majority of the mechanics from its predecessor with quiet a few improvements. Text is legible. The walkie is no longer as annoying, and can be ignored easily. Save points are more evenly sprinkled throughout the areas. Giddy points and disappointments are found with the combo weapons, which are tons of fun, but disappointing that you can't make them at their best until you unlock the ""combo card."" The camera has been removed, and I rather enjoyed that about DR1. In its place are bonus points for a much larger variety of activities and using combo weapons, which means you'll be using mostly combo weapons once the opportunity presents itself.

The Gameplay is otherwise just as you remember. Fight from group to group, grabbing new weapons as old ones break, collecting book powerups and hunting for rarer and more devastating toys. The number of weapons has gone up, though not as much as expected, though a larger area and more room to explore mean its somewhat easier to skirt groups rather than slog through everything. Levels and unlocks carry over as usual, making restarting almost strategic rather than frustrating. The level is much larger and more sprawling, but apart from being rather slow on foot, is easy to navigate and doesn't look cookie cutter from section to section.

Audio and visuals are as crisp as to be expected. The only deficiency is how few lines are used by the survivors and bystanders. Cinematics are fully voiced and well detailed.

Overall, the games what you've come to expect. Probably the most major downside is some of the times that were removed from the initial game that I'd have liked to see kept, and the lack of a sprint button. Those and some gaping plot holes right from the start are the only major smudges on whats otherwise a game thats just as fun as the original.

Addendum: I was having internet trouble initially, but I've finally gotten opportunity to play the mini game Terror Is Reality online. They have unranked games for you to get no money and no achievements, or ranked games to win money and achievements with no appreciable down side. The mini games are actually a lot of fun, have enough variety that you must play through at least 3 - 4 games to even try them all, as they are random, and you can win more cash in 5 minutes than you can in 5 hours in the actual game, making getting that shot of Zombrex a piece of cake.

  I'm sorry, (well I'm really not) Starcraft 2 is a great game, but blizzard just doesn't want to listen to their fan base any more. Here are their shortfalls
  1. NO LAN. Really? Are you kidding? Does blizzard not sit down and play their own games anymore? Lan is what made the original starcraft HUGE. It's ridiculous to think that I can be in the same room with 8 other people and not have a functional game because all of our data has to be sent accross the country and back. We're in the same room, why can't we just be able to really play in the same room. 8 people playing starcraft can really eat into your bandwith. If you don't have the top of the line internet, you may be out of luck for your 4v4 games. That's not even considering if you have other people beyond those 8 on the network. Recently at a professional tournament (march of 2011), One of the people lost connection to the game. I watched this game it was pretty intense and very close to the end. They had to reschedule a rematch! Imagine that. If blizzard had just listened to their customers this wouldn't be a problem. So you might ask, ""it's just a game why not just reconnect and play another round?"". I agree because I'm a casual gamer, so if I lose connection I'll be mad, but life will go on. However for this tournament there was a couple hundred grand ($xxx,xxx) on the line. I can only imagine how much the participants wanted to throttle someone over at blizzard. Blizzard listen up. I know you're not deaf. Steam has a play offline mode. Sure blizzard isn't steam, but last I checked playing offline isn't copyrighted. GIVE ME LAN!!!!
  2. HAVE TO CONSTANTLY BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET TO PLAY. I don't know their exact reason to do this to all of us. I don't have a cause or reason to blame, but if I were to point a finger at anyone, it would be Activision. Blizzard is huge enough and has enough of a fan base without a 2nd publisher interfering. Joining them simply doesn't make sense. Perhaps if it does maybe that's why they may be out for money instead of listen to their customers. (cough) no lan. Microsoft has the same problem as blizzard when is comes to pirating,but last I checked, despite Microsoft is demanding more money than they did for previous operating systems. They don't play babysitter and ask you to be connected to the internet at all times. I find that it's extremely disappointing that blizzard can't trust customers to be honest. Activation sure, no problem. I believe it helps us all be more honest, but why can't I play a single player game without the internet? I'm a big PC gamer and this whole movement to have to be connected online constantly when playing my games is ridiculous. It makes consoles appealing.
  All in all. other than these two major breaker-issues. I'd say you get a pretty good game.
  I honestly think we all have pirate bay and other pirate websites to blame for the issues we're facing. Honestly ask yourself if pirating wasn't an issue, would blizzard have any need to have every player log in and authenticate their copy EVERY TIME THE GET ON? EVERY TIME? lets not kid ourselves: When the community gets stolen from it hurts the community and those who steal -Even in the long run. People had been pirating games long before constant interent connections had to be made, but now they're fighting back and honest consumers are paying for it. Thanks guys.

The game starts off really strong, with Alyssa battling Sledgehammer, and as you race around finding clues to a child prodigy's murder and solving puzzles, the Hammerman killer is genuinely creepy. The game will make your pulse pound, and your fingers ache. The next villain, Corroder, is almost as intense as Sledgehammer, chasing you through an abandonded water-works, with hiding places more sparing, again leads to great, exciting game play. But then you get to level 3 and Chopper...a very annoying, feminine slasher that just gets on the nerves and doesn't do much to keep you jumping. The same goes for the bizarro ballerina's turned slashers on level 4, Scissorman and Scissorwoman. Neither character produced chills, and the high pitched taunts issued by both would-be killers get more annoying than frightening as the game progresses. The final boss, Lord Borroughs, is also a disappointment. After making your way through four pretty tough levels, your left facing off against...an English Gentleman???

I was hesitant for the longest time to try this. I added this my wishlist years ago because it looked interesting and seemed to incorporate elements I liked (farming, dating, befriending monsters, battling, helping a town, etc.), but my unfamiliarity of the series coupled with the price made me hesitate. A few days ago I was looking at me 3DS, which I hadn't touched in maybe eight or nine months, and my pitiful collection of five 3DS games and five DS games and realized I was really wasting the investment I'd placed in the console by never buying any games to play; as much as I love my small collection of games, I'd played them all so much that I'd frankly lost interest in replaying them yet again, at least not for a long while. I was browsing around on Amazon once more and somehow found my way to this page again. I saw a used copy for $34 and I snatched it up on a whim, thinking that the worst case scenario would be that I'd ship it back to the Amazon warehouse and lose out on six dollars.

But oh my god, I should have bought this games years ago (kind of glad I didn't because then I wouldn't be enjoying it now, but you know what I mean) I love absolutely everything. The graphics, the game play, the story... and you know what? This game is even better than the harvest moon games I've played. For one thing, doesn't make it impossible to get your hands on cooking ingredients (like flour; oh my f****** god, in Tale of Two Cities there were like seven ingredients I could never ever get and it frustrated me to death) and there's not a much of a feeling that time is of the essence; while a clock counts down daily, the game is so open and allows you to do so much that you don't feel pressed to get home from wandering around battling monsters and picking up stuff to water your crops (crops only need to be watered once a day). I really appreciate a game that has a lot to do, but doesn't make a player get wound up with time crunches and requirements. There are so many wonderful things about this game that I'd make this review super long if I listed and spoke about each one.

I'm not even through the game entirely and already I'm in love. This feels like the kind of game I could play on the same file for a very long time or have no issue with restarting from the beginning. There's also different difficulty levels, which I appreciate a lot. I usually stick to easy mode because I don't usually care for challenges; I like being able to freely and easily play and enjoy games, not stress myself trying to defeat them.

All in all, there's a reason over 80% of the reviewers for this game gave it 5 stars and it's still so expensive despite it being out for three years now. It's amazing. I wish the company that made this series hadn't gone bankrupt; I imagine Rune Factory 5 would have been mind blowing. Should the creators ever resurface with another Rune Factory, I'll absolutely try it out, and for now I'm going to look into the previous games.

  I'm a pretty big fan of the Suikoden Series (I've played them all) and RPGs in general and this is certainly a worthy purchase as far as a hand held title goes.

  In general the story is pretty average, good enough to keep me falling asleep but certainly not anything great. The voice acting is abnormally fast and certainly hurts the overall experience. I was also disappointed that this title has very little in common with the console titles, particularly plot wise. I find that a little perplexing considering how great the universe in the Suikoden series is (with the exception of the half finished IV). Also occasionally there's not well defined direction. Oftentimes you will have to basically ""Search"" your base or other areas to trigger story progression.

  In a pretty big change the title focuses on missions. Many missions are ""accepted"" and ""completed"" as natural story progression, which is still pretty linear. You can also accept additional quests, many of which result in recruiting additional stars of destiny (Collecting all 108 is a huge nonsensical chore with little reward - often times you must do something during a certain season, with a certain character in your party or without a certain character).

  The characters in general are pretty disappointing. I'm usually not one to bash customization but I actually think the change from weapon upgrading to purchase hurts the overall experience and makes a lot of the characters kind of blend together. When you have such a huge selection of characters to choose from it makes a lot more sense for them to have fairly well defined roles.

  Gameplay wise this is a solid RPG. Not bad at all for a hand held title. This is very much typical Suikoden or turned based Final Fantasy fare done well. You have alot of different options for party setup and choosing what spells or magical attacks to equip characters with (similar to the rune system of the console Suikodens). This is by far the best aspect of the game, even if the difficulty level is pretty low.

  The graphics are also nice (very reminiscent of Final Fantasy III (Japan) - The DS release)

  In short if you're looking for good classic turned based combat on a hand held this is a good choice however if you're looking for anything ground breaking or that has anything to do with the Suikoden universe than this game is going to disappoint you.

Finally PLEASE release a hand held version of the first 2 Suikoden titles in the US - I would happily shell out 3 times what I paid for this game to play the first 2 on a hand held.",Nothing Revolutionary...,1254873600,,,

*EDIT2*
I've just completed my battery drain test.  A little before 9.5 hours had elapsed I started getting low battery warnings.  At almost exactly 9.5 hours the headset shut itself off.  I used the following settings:
'Plugged' in to my computer using the audio cable (so not using bluetooth)
Played movies pretty much continuously for the duration (I maybe missed 5-10 minutes max).
Noise Cancellation ON
Sound Preset: Movies - 'Signature Sound'
No intentional microphone utilization (I didn't turn the mic off, so it may have been picking up ambient background noise)
Started from a fully charged state (ie - charged it, took it off the charging station, and started using it immediately)

This is slightly worse than the 10 hours I was expecting.  If using bluetooth I'd expect even lower battery life.  I'm not terribly impressed with this, given that other headsets offer longer battery life (and given that this is a $300 headset).
-------

Before I start this review, three important points to note:
1) I do not own an XBox One (though I want one :D ), and so I couldn't test out the pairing functionality.  From everything I've read and understood it should work flawlessly though.  I was able to test every other aspect of the headphones.
2) I was comparing these against several other gaming headsets I've reviewed and have by me: The Corsair Vengeance 2100 (a wireless 7.1 gaming headset with mic boom), and the Turtle Beach Z60 (a wired 7.1 gaming headset with mic boom).  I also compared it against some very high end Sony Earbuds.
3) I fully expected to give these a bad review based solely on the price (a $300 headset meant to be used with a $350 gaming system? What?  At the time of review I could get an xbox one system + the halo master chief collection for $350.  If I was to get it at walmart I'd get a free controller thrown in).

So, on to the review:

Sound Quality - 5/5: The first and most important aspect of any headphone set is the sound quality, and the 800X blew me away.  Its noticeably richer than my other headsets in the depth of sound it presented.  The different preset sound modes offer very different sound mixes, so you'll want to experiment until you find your preference for each type of media your consuming.  The headset is advertised as being able to bring to the forefront some soft background sounds (like footsteps and such for FPS gaming) and I found that, in my estimation, it does so.  That said, you'll want to be careful when listening to music most of the preset sound modes will push some frequencies noticeably more than others (and overall I noticed a much stronger bass here than in other headsets).
Interestingly, this wasn't my favorite headset: the Sony XBA-2 earbuds are.  They provide a more balanced sound and I prefer earbuds in general.  However, I realize that this is wholly a personal preference, and in the world of gaming headsets that I've used the Elite 800X are king - as they should be, for $300!

Comfort - 4/5: The earcups are a nice foam type material that is not only very comfortable, but will also stay clean (fabrics can absorb sweat or pet hair caught in them, this material won't have those problems).  For wireless headphones they seem fairly heavy, but the weight ended up feeling very distributed on my head, and I thought they were much more comfortable than the other pair of wireless headphones I tested - the Corsair Vengeance 2100.  There being no mic boom is a nice extra on the comfort front as well - eating is easier.  However, I found that after extended use (around 2 hours) the top of the headband started hurting my head a bit.  I'm fairly confident that this is due to the shape of my head and how the headphones were resting on me, so I don't see it as a huge issue for most.

Mic Performance - 5/5: I've never used a mic not on a boom before, and this one seemed to work great.  It picked up my voice well and I was generally understandable.  This is obviously not a studio quality mic, but it gets the job done for gaming.

Design - 5/5: The headset has a nice clean look to it, with green stripes (and a green LED logo on the base to indicate charging; red when charging, green when charged).  The Elite 800 is bue for playstation, and the 800X is green for XBox.  I prefer the styling on this headset to my other gaming headsets, design preferences are usually personal preferences.

Ease of Use - 3/5: This is where the headset fails most, in my opinion.  The good is wireless charging.  This is a lot more convenient than I expected it to be - I didn't realize how annoying it was to plug/unplug a charging cable until I didn't have to do it anymore.  The bad is the control schema.  You've got 4 buttons on each earpiece, and memorizing where each button is and operating each button can be very annoying.  If you don't consistently use the headset you'll easily forget where specific buttons are.  Even if you do consistently use it I found that the buttons depress far too easily.  I've switched modes when I didn't want to, turned off noise cancellation when I was trying to do something else, etc.  The worst part is that often the buttons have 'modes' - a quick depress to do one thing, a long depress to do something else.  I would have much preferred a higher actuation force, and fewer buttons (instead of having a volume up and a volume down button, for example, a volume roller would have been much better).

Battery Life - 4/5: This is partly going off of other reviews, as I haven't worn the battery down yet (despite several hours of consecutive use).  This is rated for something like 10 hours, which is more than sufficient for gaming sessions.  On the flip side, if you want to use this is as your primary headset (when traveling and such) then 10 hours is likely not sufficient.  *edit* I completed a battery life test (see the top of this review), and got 9.5 hours of battery life.

'Extras' - 5/5: There are a few other features that this headset has.  The first is noise cancellation - this works about as well as any other noise cancellation I've tested.  Most background noises are dulled out, though you can still hear directed sound quite well.  Its useful for getting rid of ambient noise.  The second is the different connection methods: There is a cable you can use to hook up to anything and get sound, at the expense of mic functionality.  It has bluetooth for wireless connectivity to any bluetooth enabled device: this gives you sound and mic capabilities.  You can even use this to answer a bluetooth phone, if you'd like!
The box it comes in is nice enough to be mentioned as an extra; its pretty and has nice padding.
Finally, there is the Turtle Beach Elite club.  I didn't get a membership # with my headset so I couldn't test this, however you supposedly can get new plates for the side of the headset, an extended warranty, better support, and some free swag (shirts and such).  I don't want to say these types of extras should be expected, but for such an expensive gaming headset ... well, there had better be something (because the sound quality is not going to be as good as a dedicated music headset).

Overall:
Overall, if you have an XBox One, want a wireless headest, and are willing to pay a hefty premium, then this is the headset for you.  Period.  For a gaming headset it has great sound quality, for a wireless headset its relatively comfortable, and the battery lasts long enough for pretty much any gaming session.
However, the caveat here is that if you just want a dedicated headset you can get cheaper ones with better sound quality, the battery doesn't last long enough to use this as a travel headset except with shorter trips, and the controls will be annoying unless you're willing to dedicate a lot of time to them.
By itself this is definitely a five star product.  However the fact that it costs about as much as the system you're going to use it for means its not for everyone.  Personally, I don't really feel that most will be able to justify the price.
If you're looking for great sound quality then a good speaker system will be better, and you can use any standalone mic solution for your mic.  If you live somewhere where a speaker system isn't practical, then you're probably either a college student, or have roommates in your apartment, or similar ... and if we're being honest, not all of those demographics can really afford a $300 headset.

Due to the poor (in my opinion) control scheme and the battery life supposedly not lasting more than 10 hours, this goes down to a 4 star product in my opinion, given the cost.  If this was cheaper it'd be a 5 star product, or if the battery life lasted longer, or if the control scheme was better.

All of that said:
I am currently running a drain test on the headset.  I started from a fully charged state and will just be cycling through movies and such using noise cancellation and the headset's 'signature sound for movies' preset - no mic usage for this test.  If the headset ends up lasting substantially more than 10 hours I'll likely edit my review up to 5 stars.  *edit* I completed the battery life test and got 9.5 hours - see the top of this review.

*edit* My pictures apparently got turned upside down and sideways and such when uploaded...

If you have played the Marvel one, you are already very familiar with how this game works.  You get lots of different characters and run around and solve cool puzzles and collect lego chips and rewards.  Silly and completely addicting!  I wanted it so bad I didn't even want to wait for Amazon to send to me, so I went and bought it at GameStop.

The only negative I have, and it really is just picking a bit, is that some of the characters look a lot alike.  Dwarfs with beards kinda all look alike to me.  But they have different powers like arrows or hammers...  But this isn't enough of a negative to distract from how much fun the game is.

i've been playing for a week straight and even though the game has more things to do, i kinda miss SIMS 2. when the characters ate or danced in SIMS 2, it was done in an exaggerated way that was entertaining (slurping their bowls, or awkwardly bustin' out into breakdance). now in SIMS 3, they just do it for the sake of doing it and almost too realistically. this is why, for example, ppl have different opinions about being able to micromanage their sims while in a store (which you can't in SIMS 3). i'll bet they'll do nothing interesting in there anyway because these characters have no character. they may as well have made the whole user-experience into just clicking through a to-do list and not see the characters at all. because that's what it feels like i'm doing sometimes.

the thing is, this is SIMS! -- it's supposed to be an entertaining GAME, not another boring second-life simulation, which is what this is now turning into. i say that w/the utmost respect to what SIMS 3 now offers, i mean i'm a big SIMS fan in general. i just hate to admit it but yeah, i'm a little disappointed this time around :T

Pros:
12-hour talk time is for real. I played a 14-hour COD4 marathon and didn't run out of power until hour 14.
Noise canceling is excellent. No echoes when listening, and doesn't register my breathing! Comes with a wall charger, and can also be charged via USB with the same cable as your controller. It can be worn on the left or right side, and has it's own mute/volume control.

Cons:
While I think it's comfortable, there is no adjustment for the behind the head loop. If this is for a younger person, or if your head is just small then it may not fit too well.
The earpiece is heavy (must be that 12 hr battery) and wants to slide down if you move around. Without any way to adjust the way it fits this is NOT a headset made for walking down the street, it's for stationary use. The head loop is  also cheap feeling compared to the earpiece. It begs careful handling because of the springy feel and how thin the plastic is. Also, you will have to pair it again after you use the wall charger, but not when you use USB. Strange, no?

The Cordless Vantage is a Bluetooth headset that works well with the PS3. If you like the way it fits then you'll be happy you spent the money.",Once again Logitech scores,1213574400,4,,
3.0,False,"07 28, 2012",AM2CKH3GQRXX4,B000V7KLKQ,T. Frye,"About a year ago, I heard of a company called Spark Unlimited. I saw an awesome looking game called Legendary at my local Gamestop for $10. I picked it up, not really expecting much. However, what I got was one of the most underrated games I had ever played. So, after being simply stunned by how good Legendary was, I researched Spark Unlimited online. I found out that they made a game in the past called Turning Point: Fall of Liberty. Having enjoyed Legendary so much, I decided to pick it up, too, in hopes that the game would be another great game from Spark Unlimited.

It turned out that Spark Unlimited must have figured out what they were doing wrong, because Turning Point: Fall of Liberty really isn't great. Moderately good at best. Why? Read on to find out.

The game starts off by talking about history. It details how Winston Churchill was in a car crash, but he survived, and went on to lead Britian against the Nazis. Then the game becomes unique. It asks an intriguing question: What if Churchill had died in the crash? Then, the next thing you know, you see the Nazis attack New York. You are Dan Carson, a construction worker in New York. You are helping build a building when the Nazis attack, and you are immediatly surrounded by explosions and gunfire. You get off of the building as it falls apart. You then see a Nazi paratrooping next to you. You start wrestling with him, and you throw him off the building. Then the adventure begins.

Or, should I say, the incredibly frustrating adventure. Turning Point tries to be a Call of Duty contender, but it pretty much fails. The main problem is with the aiming sensitivity. There isn't enough choice involved with the sensitivity, so your character either slowly turns like a tank, or turns too fast to be able to hit enemies with any accuracy. Also a problem is the inconsistent bullet damage. Sometimes a few shots killed a Nazi, other times it took half a clip. These problems may not sound like much, but they make the game a lot more frustrating than it had to be. Also an issue is the inconsistent difficulty. I played the game on normal, and a few sections of the game were incredibly hard to beat. The checkpoints are also really scarce. Say you have killed over 20 Nazis, and then you carelessly get killed by an enemy. Surprise! You have to kill all those Nazis all over again.

Beneath these issues, there is actually a pretty compelling combat system in place. The main innovation is the grappling system. Basically, if you go up to an enemy and press circle, you will wrestle with them. Then you can either instantly kill them with an environmental kill, or you can use then as a human shield, using their body as cover. The environmental kills look epic (who doesn't like kicking somebody in the groin, sending them flying into a furnace?), and the human shield is a great strategy for taking on multiple Nazis at once. If it wasn't for the issues stated in the last paragraph, this would be a truly great game.

The plot is good, but nothing special. The main issue is the lack of emotion. You aren't given any reason to care about your teammates, and almost all of the characters are completely forgetable. This is an especially notable flaw if you've ever played Homefront (read my review, PS3 version). The story in that game did a perfect job of making you feel emotionally connected to your teammates. In Turning Point, you just don't care. However, while your teammates are completely forgetable, the game still does a good job of making you want to finish the game. I wanted to see how the game would end. There are also a few cool moments sprinkled into the game, most notably raiding the White House to assassinate the Nazi president. Also, I was completely unprepared for the stunning ending, which is the only part of the game that is actually a bit emotional.

While the game is at least good in most areas, one spot where the game underperforms is in the graphics department. The game would look okay if it was released for the PS2 in 2004, but as this is a 2008 PS3 game, the game looks downright emarrassing. Environments look bland and lack detail, the framerate chugs whenever there's too much happening onscreen at once, and there are graphical glitches in the game that made me laugh out loud (Nazis use tanks with wheels that don't rotate when moving). The character models are decent, but that's pretty much the only good thing in the graphics. I recently played Medal of Honor Heroes for the PSP, and that game literally looks better than Turning Point. Simply horrible.

Audio, however, is surprisingly good. The soundtrack is great, with an orchestral score that fits with the theme of the game. The sound effects aren't anything special, but they get the job done. Meanwhile, the voice acting is a bit hit and miss. Some of the voice acting is good, while some of the other voice acting is a bit forced and unrealistic. Regardless, the audio fares a lot better that the graphics, and is at least good.

The game isn't too terrible long, ranging bettween 8-10 hours to beat. There is a disappointing lack of trophies, eliminating much reason to replay the game. There is also no collectibles, or anything else. The only thing you get for completing the game is concept art. Seriously? There is an online multiplayer mode, but with no one online, it adds pretty much no replay value to the game.

I was expecting Turning Point to be a great game, especially since it came from the developers of Legendary. However, the game is a merely average game, with bad graphics and bothersome control issues. However, considering that the game is about $3, the game is worth the investment. A unique story and an innovative melee system make this game a decent purchase. Just don't expect to be blown away.

3.0,False,"12 5, 2002",A10W5NFZ9PLX4K,B000065SQJ,Yih Dzelonh,"In all frankness UT 2K3 is somewhat of a letdown compared to the original Unreal Tournament.
Unreal Tournament 2003 plays, looks, and sounds very similar to UT, with one major advantage: The graphics are not only sigificantly better than UT's already great looking graphics, but probably the best I've ever seen in any computer game -at least First Person Shooters.  Unfortunately, this is the ONLY major advantage UT 2K3 has over its predecessor.
On the upside, UT 2003 has some of the most awesome looking environments, sky effects and lava effects you'll ever see in any PC game.  UT 2003 includes a new, innovative mode of play, ""bombing run,"" which is somewhat similar to football.  Also, there are a hefty 35 skins or so ranging from gene-boosted humans, to Egyptians to clowns to lizard-like creatures to automatons.
On the downside, gameplay is substantially marred.  Even with a 1.7 Ghz processor and 256 MB of RAM, some of the biggest and best maps (e.g., Magma, December, Bifrost, etc.) are entirely unplayable because the framerate is so horrid.  When I join an online game -via cable modem connection- I experience a lot of lag and framerate issues, also.  I had a far inferior PC and only 56K modem with the original UT and never experienced framerate issues online or offline.  Game pace is absurdly fast, much more reminiscent of Quake 3 Arena than the first UT.  For some reason there seems to be less skill required in playing this than the first UT.  In UT 2K3 you just run and jump around and hope that you can aim and dodge better than your opponent.  I'm afraid to say that it gets old fast and doesn't seem enjoyable like it did in UT.
Speaking of maps, map designs generally seem a lot worse than they did in UT.  One map is literally nothing more than a single room.  Pathetic.
The sound effects, astonishingly, are much worsely rendered in UT 2K3.  They're not bad, per se, but they don't compare to the original's.  They seem far less surreal and more ""muffed.""  How Epic could botch this is way beyond me.
The weapons don't have as much personality as UT's and they seem ""watered"" down and not very powerful.  Even the actual game menu is a colossal disappointment:  Whereas the original's was very intelligent-looking, condensed and organized, UT 2003's is one big cluttered mess which extends the entire breadth of the screen.  I've seen this game menu trend (of making the menus inordinately large and clutterd as if it was more geared for a Kindergartener who couldn't even spell and had never seen a computer before than a true PC gamer and connoisseur who appreciates sophisticated and intelligent designs) extremely often in recent years, regrettably.
In a nutshell, Unreal Tournament 2003's poignancy, creativity, quality, and meticulousness pales in comparison to the original in virtually every facet.  It's still a good game on its own merits and fun to play.  Epic has already released a patch which has addressed a lot of issues, users are constantly creating and releasing, for the public, downloadable mods and maps, etc., and there's even more incentive to play it considering that there's no competition for this type of game: I.D. Software never released a Quake 4.  Unfortunately, however, this game should've been much better.",A letdown compared to the original Unreal Tournament,1039046400,10,,

This may turn some people off, and it may make others look at this game is a very different light.
Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy was a great game, and so is the sequal, Jak II.  One of the first things that you will notice is that the ""hub"" world, Haven City, is HUGE! There are numerous alleys, shops, buildings, caverns and dark places for you to explore.  The city is massive and covers a lot of ground.  The setting has been darkened up a bit as well, Jak has gone through some...interesting changes since we saw him last.  His powers have increased...as well as his attitude.
The majority of gameplay is taken up by mission structured objectives.  You need to go to point A and do B and your reward is C.  The missions range in scope from racing to escort missions.  The game developers have obviously taken a hint from the Grand Theft Auto series in terms of gameplay.  Virtually every vehicle can be hijacked and ridden around the city.  Guards are patrolling the streets, and if you make trouble, they will chase you down and shoot some pretty wicked weapons in your general direction- to avoid them you need to either hide or outrun them.
The camera is great, and can be repositioned to help you out with the trouble spots.  As expected, the graphics are smooth and lush, with a great style of animation incorporated into the final product.  There are no load times and the scenery flows together nicely.  As I mentioned earlier, the world on which we find outselves is massive and there are many objectives to accomplish before we can unlock all its secrets.  The addition of a map option is a great help as the size of Jak II's world(s) can sometimes be overwhelming and confusing.
The only thing that detracts from the game is the difficulty level on some of the missions.  I have found myself trying for over an hour at times to clear one objective or another.  The game can be downright brutal, cruel, sadistic and even petty...yet I always find myself going back into the fray for more.

It would appear that Creative Assembly is working with different retailers to provide different unique units, which cannot be obtained otherwise, except through that specific retailer.  These unique units are generally more powerful than the regular ones featured in-game.

**It would appear that at this time, there is no way to buy all 9 special units.**

  * Rogers' Rangers: Major Robert Rogers' company of rangers are highly trained elite light infantry, specialising in reconnaissance and special operations. They are extremely mobile in even the most challenging environments.

  * Ottoman Organ Gun: A viciously powerful field gun, able to inflict incredible damage on the opposing army. Emphatic proof of the Ottoman Empire's advanced knowledge of gunpowder and firearms technology.

  * Ghoorkas:""Better to die than be a coward"" has been the motto of these elite Nepalese soldiers for centuries. Disciplined, tough and courageous, they carry a deadly 18-inch long, curved knife known as the kukri.

  * Corso Terrestre Guerillas: An independent light infantry guerrilla regiment, experienced in skirmish and stealth tactics. Surprise raids and ambushes are the guerillas' favoured tactics, a way to compensate for their limited number and light armour.

  * Bulkeley's Regiment: A French unit of Irish mercenaries with a fearsome reputation for hardiness. Exceptionally tough and resilient, they make for a highly flexible and dependable regiment.

So the question is, how do you get the other 3 special forces units, e.g. the Death's Head Hussars, USS Constitution, and Dahomey's Amazons?  It turns out that the game is already coded with for all the special forces units, and unlocking them may just require particular research or holding certain territories.

USS Constitution: this unit is only available when playing as the USA and your technology has sufficiently advanced. It may also be captured by opposing factions.

Death's Head Hussars: this unit is only available when playing as Prussia and your technology has sufficiently advanced. Prussia must also hold Brandenburg.

Dahomey Amazons: this unit is only available when holding territory in North Africa.",Clarification of Special Forces Edition,1236038400,63,,

You rescue the world that has fallen into gray boredom. What a premise... :). I wish in real life there is a super hero. Makes all our life cheerful and colorful.

You really have to know the basics of colors. What and what adds upto the final color. The music changes as your blob changes color. They have picked up very appropriate elements for every color. When you hear new music for the first time as the color changes, it will give you a high kick to your brain. Very well executed game play with minute care to details.

The basic structure of the game is similar to Katamari. You roll around, jumping and painting all the surfaces etc. etc. Open up more new section and add more colors. The game play never gets repetitive. As the levels progress you have to go from coloring every thing to coloring particular sections and mix and match things. The game play is always fresh. For any one who doesnt know about this game, it started as a free PC game in EU. So they have had enough background to make sure the game is nicely flushed out.

Camera work is the best I have seen in recent times. The fixed camera works as tight as in God of War. Controls are sharp, you never miss a jump. Even in 3rd person every thing works perfect. For love of gaming, buy this one. For any one complaining Wii doesn't have good 3rd party games. Take a hard look at Bloom Box and this game.

Pros:
 - The game itself.
 - Fantastic theme and Art direction
 - Graphics. This is probably the best looking Wii game. Runs at 60 fps 16:9 wide screen.
 - Audio. Exceptional, it is layered audio. You actions change what you hear

My work colleagues and I play this game on a regular basis - once you can master the basic controls, it's a tremendous amount of fun.
Don't let the cartoon-like 2D animation fool you - this is a game that requires considerable strategic planning several moves in advance. The number of powerful weapons only adds to the strategic choices. Shall I use the Ninja rope,swing over a cliff, and drop a Holy-hand grenade? Shall I release an exploding sheep over a deep chasm to destroy an opponents worm? Should I fire Patsy's Magic bullet instead, eliminating a worm half-the-map away. The strategic possiblilites are endless.
The Ninja rope is particularly useful, as it allows you to swing over cliffs, or into crevices, and plant explosive weapons in places you wouldn't be able to otherwise.

The sequel pretty much improved everything I hated about Mass Effect, I love the idea of Heat clips it is much better than your weapons overheating with unlimited ammo. Your teammates are also so much better, I hated that I was limited to maybe 3-4 of my companions on the first one because of the inventory system. The sequel removes that inventory system, all you do is but upgrades to weapons and it applies to everyone on your team. On the first one you are pretty much limited to being a Soldier because using any other class is pretty much useless, the sequel don't have that problem; every class is powerful in their own way and each and everyone of your teammates are a force of their own.

Docking two stars because the disc only installed 20% of the game, now I have to download the remaining 16GB on a connection that only gets download speeds of 240 Kb/s.

I'll be able to comment on the gameplay tomorrow once it FINALLY downloads AND updates.

Thanks Bethesda........

Update:

Added a star because this game has really awesome gameplay, graphics, customization, etc.  I still dock a star because of the download, and also because of some glitches and other issues which I hope Bethesda will get around to fixing:

- The game will sometimes minimize for no reason (Windows 64 bit).  I am not hitting my windows key, my keyboard has a switch to turn those keys off so I don't accidentally minimize myself.  When it does minimize, there is a slight chance that when you restore to full screen, your computer will lock up and you will be forced to turn the computer off and back on at the power button.

- Sometimes when I rapidly change weapons on a hotkey, the graphic disappears along with the crosshairs and I have to go into third person and back to first person to restore it.  I try to change my weapons before a fight (I have high sneak) based on how I feel the fight will turn out so then I can correct that bug beforehand.

- I'm bilingual, so I chose to play the game in Spanish.  I find it annoying that Bethesda chose not to translate names that could easily be translated i.e. Diamond City (should be referred to as Ciudad Diamante), or Minutemen (there's no literal translation in Spanish, but the closest could be Los Milicianos or The Militiamen).  But that's me, I'm a stickler for 100% accurate translations and I have criticized many companies in the past (mainly Blizzard) for that.

- Also sometimes the ghouls bug out and start running around you, into walls, or up ruined buildings and jumping off and repeating, pretty humorous at times.

But all in all I recommend this game, and I might go to five stars if Bethesda addresses the kinks in later patches.  Just Bethesda...STOP the minimizing in the game!

I was impressed Smackdown! 3 on PS2, but it got boring after awhile and I needed something new. Finally Wrestlemania X8 came out on GC, and I rushed out to buy it. I must say I was a bit disappointed. Here is the good and bad -
THE GOOD - good character selection, it has everyone from the Rock to Spike Dudley, I was impressed by the selection even though there was twice more on No Mercy for N64. The matches were great, it has the first full sized Hell in a Cell, and the TLC was fun. Gameplay can also last very long and it can be a blast with 4 players going at it. The wrestlers look very well done, and the entrances for them are amazing.
THE BAD - i was disappointed that the create a character was so limited. you get no clothes that the superstars wear, and you only get 10-15 choices for upper body or whatever, i was disappointed, but you can make Mankind if you wish becuz it has all the clothes for him in there, including the face with the mask. I feel they couldve done much better on it though. apparently there is no career mode on this, there is a Path of A Champion mode, but that has no storylines involved in it, it just has you fight a ton of people until you get to the champion, than you win the belt and so on. not enough to keep you going back. limited grappling moves and such make it dull after awhile too. plus another thing that got aggravating was that it is WAY too easy to reverse finishing moves, sure it adds to more fun, but it seems like once you nail down the easy L+R buttons to reverse a finisher, you never have to fear
THE UGLY - i noticed that in TLC matches if you get thrown on a ladder from a move that the ladder will move its way from under you, and go next to you, and most of the time fall out of the ring. something that gets very aggravating. i think the 2 most aggravating part of the game is that it seems like in a match, the first person to get the first hit dominates the match. becuz after one tiny move you are down for a good 10 seconds like you have been playing in the same match for 10 minutes. plus the realism becomes a pain becuz your partner could execute a move to an opponent in a tag match, and if you are in the way you get knocked down. plus matches like Triple threat are NO fun, that is if you have 2 CPU opponents, becuz they will always team up on you and it gets very aggravating that you can't do a thing. plus the control style is totally different from any N64 wrestling games, so you have to learn a whole new control style, and i favor the old N64 style over this new one. i'm sure others will too.
all in all a pretty decent game. i feel like they could've done much better with some of the gameplay and matches. plus the control style is similar to the Smackdown series on PS1 and PS2, but i always favored the N64 style. the flaws and CPU AI make the game aggravating, and it can get boring after awhile due to limited grappling moves. but the Hell in a Cell and battle royal matches with 4 players is a blast, so if you are looking for a good 4 player game, this is the way to go, but if you are looking for a good single player game, i would wait till a better wrestling game comes out for Cube.",Could've been better....,1025568000,,,

Captures a lot of the great and enjoyable aspects of various games like the open world environment of GTA, the climbing of buildings of Assassin's Creed (and a fun power upgrade that allows you to fly/glide from building to building), a ""grittiness"" that reminded me of PS2 The Suffering. Very fun game play without any frustrations or monotony. Well paced and fun electric power upgrades. It's also fun having the option to switch hands (left or right) when using powers. The choice to play the game evil or good with a meter that tracks your actions is a cool touch and allows for interesting replay of the game (just beat it as Good). Choice of zapping pedestrians with electrical powers or helping and saving pedestrians on street is a cool & fun feature. One ""mission"" that I was unimpressed with is trying to reach certain checkpoints over a certain time period (similar to Assassins Creed). I find these boring and not very fun.

The critical flaw is the mechanics of the game. I'm hearing and experiencing that the engine just draws so much CPU resource that the game just always runs horrible. EVERYTHING turned down and the frame rate is still barely playable, and on a better platform of computer it should work a bit better. I noticed that it's because of the ice being rendered because when there is no sparkly amazing looking ice on walls, the game runs smoothly. The other mechanical failure is that the physics are sensitive.

Very linear story/paths.  There is also a definite feel of isolation with extremely long single-path dungeons and slow battles which make me feel a bit claustrophobic and annoyed.

4.0,False,"08 27, 2015",A15A8X8AGG8EJI,B011L4D30W,MWM,"I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are so many bundles, and offers change constantly. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.

There doesn't seem to be a promotion for these currently (though there should be some for Black Friday). The new designation for Console with one controller and Console with two controllers just lets you toggle between the standard bundle and the bundle with an extra new controller at about full price. You'd actually save a few buck buying separately, so I wouldn't go for any of them (I don't expect any controllers, except the Elite, to be scarce this season).

A short list of features that may interest you, shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -

HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.

It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Gears or War Ultimate Edition includes all 4 Xbox 360 Gears games and Fallout 4 includes Fallout 3, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]

It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.

Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions (I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.

External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spacious and cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.

The bundles-

The bundles can be split into 3 different groups based on time of release. The upcoming and current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it (excepting the new Kinect bundles). Legacy consoles include an older controller without the standard audio jack (excepting the Forza 6 bundle) and shouldnt be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven't included, due to their rarity at this point). There are no other functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).

Upcoming bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -

Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, and triggers for the professionals or tinkerers. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller has been released to wide acclaim (modifiable professional controllers can easily go for twice as much), but is scarce at present. If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it, or a headset, from the looks of it. B rating. Also note that this version releases earlier if purchased from the Microsoft Store or Gamestop.

Current bundles -

Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.

Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases November 3rd. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel will be even better. Great for adults who love action adventure. Amazon won't be stocking this one, unfortunately...

Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, the old model controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage.

Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc (as well as all 360 Gears games as downloads if you play online before the end of the year), Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases October 27th. A rating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included.

Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only.

Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.

FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. (I think these are being phased/sold out) I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 14 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- for each. With the live Gold card and Forza Horizon 2 download (separate product pages) A rating.

Gears of War 500GB bundle. $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download (as well as all 360 Gears games if you play online before the end of the year). This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B+ rating. With the live Gold card and Forza Horizon 2 download (separate product pages) A rating.

Legacy bundles-

Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and custom (new, with 3.5mm audio jack) controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content, and a chat headset. A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.

Halo Master Chief Collection 1TB bundle. $399. Looks like this being phased out. Standard console, plus download code for the Master Chief Collection (the four numbered Halo games in a single package). B rating.

Halo Master Chief 500GB bundle. $349. If you can get it at the retail price, I'd consider it an A-, since the cost to upgrade storage to 1TB or greater is around or less than the $50 to get the 1TB model, and it'll perform better.

Keep in mind that the lowest prices and best bundles tend to happen around the winter holiday season, so unless you really want to get one now, you're probably best served waiting till around Black Friday, when multiple stores will be trying to entice you with lower prices and more pack-ins. This is especially true since Sony recently cut the price of the Playstation 4.

At this point, I think the best offer for the holidays for an X1 bundle will be for $50 off current price point, plus an extra game and second controller (Dell at least, will offer such a deal). The risk is availability and whether the bundle or extra game would be one you'd want.

The main feature I really like (and abuse) is the create-a-player feature and the ability to maximize players' stats. It's real fun to make a super-team, although bear in mind you can only alter stats for about 12-16 players in the entire game, if my memory is correct.

The controls are very easy to master, but as with many PS2 games (well honestly even games today) some times they don't always connect. I've found that the CPU more often than not gets the unfair advantage when it comes to fouls; my sliding tackles garnered more yellow cards than the CPU's even when they were clearly out of order! But it's not all the time and it isn't a game-killer. One petty thing that I don't like is how repetitive the announcers audio is. Again, this is a PS2 game and I understand that there isn't much space back in the day to include dynamic and ever-changing voice work for each game. But you get really tired of the same analysis of each goal very quickly. ""Can he get it in?"" ""Oh it's there!""  has been burnt in my mind forever.

5.0,False,"09 17, 2008",A1UPWXH1L5E3G7,B000TD3IA2,Defiant,"A lot of good folks have described this game salient features in great details so I won't go into how the game functions. I will rather try to describe how I feel about the game.

I think Warhammer lives up to all the hype it had going for it which was not a easy thing to do. The game has the best implementation of a pvp system that I have seen thus far in any other mmo. Most other mmo's force people to pve in order to enjoy pvp in the game which in reality is nothing more than a side-game in most casses. Before War it was not possible to pvp and advance meaningful in other mmo's. Warhammer has changed all of that. The pvp in this game is a integral part of the virtual world. Whatever you do in the game relates directly to the war effort on your side. You can only pve and still contribute indirectly to your side victory or you can just do pvp or combine pvp/pve...in essence anything you do is affecting the all-out war that is going on. I really like the fact that this game lets you advance or level up your character by either pvp or pve or mix of both which is very rare to find in any other mmo.

I also want to mention that I found the pve in this game good quite entertaining. If people will read the text they will find pve quests follow a well-developed storyline for your faction. The game is not pve lite by anymeans however if someone is a harcore pve'er or raider than he/she might not be satisfied with the game..well you can't win them all.

I personally think the graphics are quite good. I have maxed everything and forced settings through my video driver and I see lots of details, nice lightning and sharp textures in the game. I actually kind of like the surreal, and gritty war like atmosphere depicted in the game which adds a sense of realism to the game taking place in war-torn world. On the destruction side you get to see order citizens being totured or tormented, towns being destroyed or pillaged quite frequently which is something I have rarely seen in other mmo's. I think the game is aiming for a more mature audience which is a welcome change and no wonder I have not seen any Chunk Norris or other leet talk so far. Thank god on this one.

The classe are diverse and well done in the game. Each faction has unique classes. Though they follow general archetype guidlines but their implementation is unique. This add a sense of realism as both sides have classes that showcasses that faction feel. Order classes are full of heroism, and hope while Destruction classes are full of villianious trappings and dark mechanics quite unlike other mmo's where the good or the villianous side plays the same classes which feels unrealistic.

Anyways I will highly recommend this game to anyone willing to try a new mmo which provides equal treatment to both pvp and pve segments of the game.

4.0,False,"05 12, 2014",A28TPVUQ4WKKLU,B00KDJJL8A,Brotherhood1994x,"First off, I would like to say that for a new developer, this game is a good sign for things to come. I love dark fantasy games and anything including demons and gods. The demon system in this game really drove me to buy this in the first place.
  When I first started playing, I stayed on the menu for about 10 minutes because I really like the title menu music and the rest of the soundtrack for this game is glorious. Also,  I did not despair over the
lack of character customization. I had enough to work with, honestly. The graphics are so-so because some areas and characters are detailrd better than others. Eolas, Buffallo,  and Rhelmar seemed to be the most detailed. However, face 1 for the protagonist was detailed quite well.
  I used a surround sound headset and I could hear the music quite well. It was amazingly done. Many tracks were very calming while others set the tone for intense moments with great bass. I would buy the OST if they sold it.
  Voice-acting is mediocre but not terrible like some claim.
  I'm on my third playthrough upping the difficulty each time. The game is extremely challenging. A couple hits can kill you on Buffalo and Captain difficulty. It isn't impossible to finish though.
  The level-up trees are impossible though. You can honestly only max out one. I tried two trees like IGN claimed, but you are left with a few empty slots on each tree. Trophies require you to max out each tree but that would mean three playthroughs.
  Romancing a companion is available in Bound by Flame. It doesn't reveal much, just a short scene usually involving a kiss and then blacking out. It still is exciting to choose who you wish to romance and support.
  Overall, the game is praise-worthy. The demonic transformation is awesome to speculate as you make choices. The soundtrack is addicting and memorable.

4.0,False,"09 10, 2013",A60O7VXU5JQD9,B00BQZ5EWW,Zman17,"The first Rome was by far my favorite of the Total War series.  At some point I had conquered the world with just about every playable race, so going in expectations were extremely high for the next in the series.  After playing for a week, I want to give this 5 stars, because the game is a lot of fun, but bugs/issue make it impossible.

The city management system is very good, it's all about maintaining a balance between your treasury, your armory, peoples happiness, and food production.  For example if you want to build the a training ground that will let you train the most powerful troops, that building will also produce a large amount of squalor that will make your people unhappy (and thus likely to revolt).  Space in the cities is limited, so I found myself constantly tinkering with my cities to maintain the strongest military closest to the front while using my inner cities to supply the food/supplies to fight.

The armies while handled different from Rome 1, I've also come to like.  Building provide garrisons (based on type) to protect the city, armies have to have a general in them, and the number of generals is limited by the amount of land you've conquered.  This seemed to make the army management much easier to work with, instead of trying to manage tons of towns and generals, you just seem really need to manage the generals.  Recruitment and replenishment seems much easier as well compared to the prior Rome.  I do miss the dynastic feeling of having all the generals come from you family, but I like how units that are together a long time can gain unit traditions (abilities) separate from the Generals who lead them.

The battles are fun but a little frustrating.  Maybe it's because I've only played as Rome so far, but the enemy really seems to break way to easily.  As long as you are using basic tactics such as protecting your artillery and not allowing the enemy to out flank you, you should win most battles unless you are hideously outnumbered.  Calvary really serves no purpose that I've found besides running down enemy archers once the armies are engaged, and in most of the battles I've fought the computer AI seems to never use calvary themselves.  A couple times I tried to wheel my horse in behind enemy lines, but the enemy units would break/flee before they could even get in position. Naval battle I didn't get at all, and after some rather odd outcomes just resorted to auto resolve to complete them.  Still there is something satisfying about a good siege battle, or crushing a massive enemy force in the forests of Europe that kept be playing.

Now for the problems, which I would basically sum up in two ways, bugs and AI.

First for bugs, the game has a tendency to crash.  Can't say it happens all the time, but I'd say in the 15-20 hours I've played I've seen it happen at least 6-7 times.  Really annoying was in the middle of one battle the game would crash at around the same time continuously (3 times in a row).  Another bug I saw a lot was on the diplomacy screen, sometimes the buttons would all be greyed out, including the option to exit the diplomacy screen.  The only way to resolve it was to basically force the game to close and reload.  I got into the habit of saving before trying diplomacy.  Finally and I don't know if this is a bug or just a performance issue, but the load times and times between turns is excessively long.  I have a year old computer that met or exceeded all the requirements on this game so I don't think that is the issue.  It was not uncommon to wait several minuets between turns, I would suggest turning off the computer movements to help with this.

Now the AI, which seems..... questionable.  I understand thatin a game like this where there is a lot going on, occasionally you'll see odd things but finding repeated odd behavior is frustrating.  The AI diplomacy decisions seem completely random, and the treaties they offer you are almost always ridiculous.  Several long time allies would just decide to cancel all treaties with me for no reason I could determine, I wasn't attacking their allies or helping their enemies, they just got bored I guess.  They wouldn't attack, just randomly cancel trade treaties.  Another issue I saw was sieges from sea units, twice I saw a vastly inferior force lay siege to a city, and then basically both sides would do nothing.  Carthage was under siege for something like 15 turns before I got sick of waiting and just used my army to kick out the attacking army so I could conquer the city.  The naval force that had been holding the city, which included a large naval garrison, under seige was two ships.  The same thing happened later on the African coast where one Egyptian naval unit besieged a city for 25+ turns until I finally kicked them out and attacked the city myself.

Despite the bugs and problems I'm still really enjoying the game, with a few minor fixes I think this can be equal or even exceed the original.  For the price, you would hope it would come that way out of the box, but I still wouldn't have any reservations about recommending this game to friends, especially if the liked the first one.",Good Game With the Potential to be Great,1378771200,3,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

While I haven't worn them consistently for more than a couple of hours at a time, where other sets would certainly become noticeable, these feel just about as light and breathable as when they were first put on. The illuminated ring on the exterior of the cup is also pretty neat.

I actually use these for gaming on the PS4 after my family goes to sleep; for which this set works well. Particularly when my controller runs out of juice and I have to mainline it. I say this because the cord that stretches from the male USB plugin to the headset is about 82-and-a-half inches, or just under seven feet. Seven feet is much longer than the controller's hardline, but my couch is about 10 feet away from my console. This being the case, outside of marathon gaming sessions in which my controller dies, I typically plug a cheap in-ear set directly into the eighth inch input on the controller. Of course, it is precisely for the marathon sessions that I prefer the added comfort that the Siberia head set provides.

The sound quality is decent but not great. I would say that it is about on par with the inexpensive in-ear set I mentioned earlier. A little disappointing really.

The integrated microphone works great... if you're the only person in the room. I suspect it is due to the lack of a mini-boom placing the mic directly in front of the wearer's mouth that it picks up a fair amount of ambient speech if someone in the vicinity is talking. I'd say it can pick up about a 3-4 foot radius, depending upon how loud the person is speaking. Like I said, though, great as long as you're solo.

Overall, I'm not disappointed with this set. The comfort factor alone is a real redeeming quality for me. Long gaming sessions can be a real pain as far as headsets are concerned, but Siberia's set largely addresses this frustration. If they had even a little bit better sound quality and a more precise mic, it might be the perfect gaming headset.",Super Comfortable!,1420243200,,,

After taking so much time to detail the world to spec, why on earth is the driving style arcade and no way to choose for a more realistic drive?
The replay feature on this game is horrid, if you actually want to watch it for the replay.  The camera angle and ""lighting effects"" (for lack of better word) change sparatically and you may or may not be able to see what you wanted with the terrific detail of the game.
As someone else noted... after you hit a car for as much damage as it can handle, it will blink a few times then go poof!  Also, once you hit a car, all it's passengers suddenly appear outside of the vehicle.  Seriously now, lets all go out in the middle of the road in a car, then just suddenly pop out if we are nudged by anything.
Also of note, if you want to brake at any time, be CERTAIN to keep all four wheels on the ground..  trust me... if ONE wheel is in the air, your car WILL ACCELERATE!  Even if you apply brake.
Another point of interest, if you are falling a short distance, then land with brake applied, the vehicle will spin approximately 25 to 30 degrees to the left.  This makes it VERY difficult to line up moving panels...  oh... and WHAT?! Moving panels i mean like MARIO where you have to jump from the bricks that move, to other one's that are also moving...

I've always been a Sega and Nintendo fan, and mostly against Sony from the start, and this really does the trick. Of course today, everyone thinks the PS2 is the ""DC Killer."" Not true in any way, shape or form.
Sega has the best games. They don't put out games every 15 minutes like Sony- they actually think about them before releasing them. They have better racers, better action games, FAR better RPGs, and Sports games completely knock PS-X into the dirt. Graphics are superb and also superior to the PS2 as well. Compare MSR to GT 3, World Series 2K1 or NFL 2K1 to ANY sports game on PS2, NBA 2K1 to NBA Live 2001, Skies of Arcadia to any Final Fantasy, etc. This system is underrated just because it's not being made anymore.
PS was hideous from the start. I NEVER thought anything on that was worth the brain cells. Awful graphics, slow loading times, stupid, pointless games- need I say more? Everyone thinks they have all these good RPGs- not true. EVERY RPG they have is just a remake of the previous with another number next to it. (Chrono Cross was just Final Fantasy with a different name, same with Legend of Dragoon.) Sega has some of the best RPGs ever and they're all completely different in gameplay and ideas, and have better graphics and replayability- Silver, Skies of Arcadia, PSO 1 and 2, Record of Lodoss War, Grandia 2, Soulreaver, etc. Same with racers- there's never been a game on PS as fun as Crazy Taxi 1 & 2. Demolition Racer: No Exit blows away Twisted Metal and all, Sega GT, Tokyo Extreme 1 and 2, etc. Sports is no question. Sega has the only online games, with better gameplay and graphics. (Of course Sega is smart enough not to have games from 989- have they EVER made even a decent game?) And NO ONE has a fighting game that can compare to Soulcalibur.
Yes, this system isn't given enough credit. PS2 is not superior at all- they have to bite games off Sega just to get titles (Crazy Taxi and Grandia 2 ring a bell?)

First major improvement is I don't need to flip up a paenl to see the Gamepanel LCD...this one has it right there for easy readability.

I still get 18 programmable keys, which are a snap to program for nearly any game I have that supports such things.

I LOVE the choice of color backlights vs my G15 is simply on or off blue. If anything this is my favorite feature because I find myself late at night or early morning on the computer and the backlight is a MUST HAVE feature.

Where my G15 has extra USB ports, this one has a headphone jack and mic jack. Seems this is a wiser change since many headphones have short cables and now we are given one right near us that will support our favorite pair.

The other smart feature is Multi-key input: Press up to six keys at once to perform multiple complex moves without interference or ghosting. Kids and I have been playing some first-person shooters and fighting games on the PC and this helps with some of the combo moves without messing up the game.

From a glance, this is the R-Type we know and love.  We get side scrolling levels, powerups that absorb bullets, and Bydo enemies that are easily recognizable as Bydo.  R-Type Final has good consistency with the rest of the series.

Where this game really shines is customization.  Alternate ships, powerups, and colors await you.  These unlock as you play more, and offer good incentive to experiment.  If you want to unlock everything, you'll be here a long time.

The actual gameplay and level design, I'm afraid to admit, has some bad pacing issues.  The first level says it all: Fly around a bit.  Oh, a few enemies.  Shoot them.  Now fly around for a while before finding more.  Yawn.  Now check out the Flying Battleship stage, a R-Type staple.  Here the level moves at an astonishingly sluggish pace, with so much slowdown it makes SNES Super R-Type look speedy.

Sure, R-Type is known for being a slower paced shmup, believe me I've played them all extensively, however it's never been _this_ slow.  Boredom sets in waiting for the more interesting parts to kick in.

Luckily there is a decent amount of challenge to be found, and some sections will likely take a lot of tries to perfect.  The difficulty settings are functional and impact the difficulty well, for those who want to use them.

So I guess it depends on what you're looking for.  If you want a shmup with lots of options and replay value, there's a lot to do here.  If you're looking for a solid gameplay experience, other R-Type games offer vastly more.  R-Type Final is an aptly named title in more ways than one, because it's the final R-Type game I'd suggest playing.","Good customization, but has pacing issues.",1355702400,,,

*** Great Co-Op title, pretty easy game

In the late 1980s, Capcom made some great licensed games (an oxymoron, I know) based on Disney properties, with ""Duck Tales"" being the premier example.  ""Chip `n Dale"" is another example, though perhaps less so than ""Duck Tales"".

""Chip 'N Dale: Rescue Rangers"" features eleven stages total, although some can be skipped.  The stages are varied, and have memorable boss battles.  Overall the game is on the easy side, which is wholly appropriate for the market this game was aimed for.  Unlike other titles like ""Battletoads"" and ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", there are no difficulty spikes that render the game almost unplayble.  The boss battles, like the rest of the game, are on the easy side and are wholly enjoyable

After beating the initial level, you are presented with a world map with each level marked as a letter (A-G).  The bare minimum that must be played to reach Fat Cat, the game's final boss, is actually seven levels.  You can beat the game in a mere seven levels, completely bypassing four levels.  The shortest route to Fat Kat is skipping A and C and going to Level B, then D, then F, then G.  E is an optional level.

After beating G, you are taken to a second section of the World Map, with levels H, I, and J ahead of you.

The game is short and won't take you long to beat. However there is some extended life in the game by the great co-op play present in the title.  I rented this game back in the late 1980s when it came out and first played the game with a cousin of mind - and let me tell you, that was a lot of fun.  The game is so much better with two players.

Nintendo talks about how they wanted to get co-op Mario as early as SMB3 but weren't able too.  Don't know why, because there are plenty of co-op experiences on the NES, and this is one of the better ones.

This (short) game also appeared as a feature article and on the cover of ""Nintendo Power"".  I remember renting (and subsequently buying) this game on the strength of the co-op gameplay, as both players, one controlling Chip and the Dale, can have game bonding together.

The video game website IGN rated this title as the 71th greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.

(For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games, you simply MUST play ""Moon Crystal"", a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive. The graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo ""Ninja Gaiden"", amazing music, in depth gameplay, and a fantastic storyline. Absolutely amazing! Had this been released in the US for the NES, I feel it would be as revered as the other heavy hitters in the NES canon)","Great Co-Op title, pretty easy game",1346198400,2,,

Wow was I ever wrong, and I'm really glad I chose to get it. Hands down this is my favorite DS game so far, and I haven't even finished it yet.

You play as a chocobo and can name yourself whatever you want. A friend of yours has you open this book he got, and it ends up stealing the souls of all your friends. You are then sent on a mission to go defeat this book/evil spirit and get all your friends back. More storyline develops afterwards that I won't spoil.

The thing I just LOVE about Chocobo tales is all the mini games. Most of the time I don't like mini games because they're annoying and not well made, but the ones in this game are very enjoyable. That's also pretty much the main focus of the game: jumping into pop-up story books and beating the mini game inside. Then the story proceeds and you learn more about the plot and what not. There's also a card game worked into the system, and normally I hate that because they make it too complex. But this one is very simple and fun!

The game is a 2D-style platformer, but objects in the game are all full 3D models.  The game has 6 islands to traverse.  That may sound like the game might be a little short, but fear not.  The game is not too short at all.  Many of the levels are longer than levels in Donkey Kong Country Returns also.

There are 4 playable characters this time around.  DK can be partnered up with Diddy, Dixie, or Cranky.  Diddy allows you to hover with his jetpacks.  Dixie does a whirly jump that lets you gain a little additional height, unlike Diddy's jetpack hover move.  And Cranky Kong uses his cane to allow you to do a pogo-style landing that bounces you higher than your original jump.  You can also bounce up off of spikey surfaces with this technique.  I'd say Dixie's move is the most useful but they are all helpful moves.

Donkey Kong Country Returns' Time Trial mode returns also.  Once you've beaten a stage, you then have the option to play it in Time Trial mode, where the goal is simply to clear the stage as quickly as you can.

Each world has a challenge level in it.  To unlock it, you must collect all of the KONG letters in every level in that world.  Beating the challenge level in every world to collect all of the Ancient Relics will unlock three challenging bonus levels.  If you can clear all three, you will unlock hard mode.  In hard mode you only have 1 heart, so you need to be careful or death can happen quickly.  This time though, hard mode is not mirrored.  Also, just like in Donkey Kong Country Returns, the KONG letters can be collected again in hard mode, which changes the color of the icon to show that you got them all on hard mode.  Beating a level on hard mode lights up a hard mode icon that appears once you have unlocked hard mode.  In addition, the level marker on the world map will also change color when you beat the level in hard mode.  So you can easily tell what you've beaten in hard mode.

The story follows a man who was kidnapped by the ruler of this Indian providence. There are two main story lines (You can go with the traditional male's story or go with the revolutionary female story) and the ending has two different choices as well (no spoilers here though). The gameplay is very similar to assassian's creed or dying light in the most broad sense. You must climb to the top an area to gain vision of the map around. Once you control that base you can infiltrate an enemy encampment. After taking over that you get missions in the surrounding area. There are about 20 radio towers and maybe 30 bases to conquer. There are 4 strongholds which are extremely strong bases (that apparently get weaker as you progress in the game). You can be loud and destroy bases with pure brute force or you can stealthily take out every base without being spotted. That is your choice. Personally I tried to do them about 50/50 and it turned out fun either way.

However, I recommend if possible Far Cry 3 over this game due to the fact the story line is vastly better in #3 t han in this one.

It hasn't the graphical beauty, the story ambition (though its parts have great ones), or unique design elements meant to push the rpg genre to new heights.  Reasons for this are obvious: Arc the Lad 1&2 were much before the flash of FF, so comparable graphics shouldn't be expected.  Arc 3 was release after FF 7 and 8, but didn't seek lofty ambition.
Basically its about this, FUN.  That's the word of the day people, so listen close.  Arc the Lad is a strategized, character developed, story driven (at least the first two), job hunting, monster bashing good time.
That's right, I said STRATEGIZED, meaning like a grid-based strategy game.  Think Final Fantasy Tactics with less depth, and that's pretty much it.  That lack of depth gives this game a much more user-friendly feel, allowing for pick-up-and-play action instead of read-the-manual-5-times-and-still-get-the-[snot]-kicked-out-of-you-action.
Arc the Lad's play mechanics are like a strategy/traditional rpg hybrid, combining the character control and exploration of a traditional (Arc 2, mostly) with grid-combat intensive battles (what Arc 1 is pretty much, with only two chances throughout to control the character like previously stated).  All three include this extremely unique mix of both elements, happily dishing steaming helpings of fun.
Arc 1 is the one mainly lacking in depth, it hasn't much but offers a very simplistic and perfectly enjoyable time.
Arc 2 continues 1's abrupt stoppage with a much more fleshed out story (not the single-minded save the world story of 1) featuring characters expertly developed that show many more emotional facets (like an opal compared to a marquis-cut diamond, both are beautiful, but the diamond has more to look at).
Arc 3 takes place 10 years later, thrusting upon the player new characters with mere cameos of previous protaganists.  Though this can be a bit saddening, Arc 3 is a great game in its own right--continuing that extremely enjoyable battle system that was the draw of the 2 previous.
The story, as expected, is excellent.  Much of this is due to Working Designs' attention to detail; through that, a beautiful creature was created.  It's fun and easy to read while providing comic relief to the melodrama (yeah, there is quite a bit of it in Arc 2, unfortunately).  The melodrama is pretty jarring, but it fits into the story alright and isn't any reason to not play.

However, this game instantly had me glued to the screen and hasn't let go yet.  I'm about 16 hours into it and I'm ready for what looks to be another 14 hours of sheer greatness.

The Graphics- are fantastic.  Scores of aliens will be onscreen at a time, yet there is no slowdown, and all of your attacks look fantastic.  I haven't gotten tired of all the different attacks yet- they just look so awesome.

The Gameplay- there are plenty of games that try to do what this game succeeds at, but most of them suck.  You face off against hoards of aliens while slowly upgrading a very broad array of skills.  The game is accessible both to advanced and beginning gamers- old levels can be replayed to get more experience to beat the new ones.  The game has 60+ missions, and to get a perfect 100 percent, you will probably have to play them multiple times to get all-S ranks.  I'm not usually the type of guy to go for 100 percent completion, but for this game I'm making an exception.

The Story- The really cool thing is that this game comes with all of the cinematics from the first game- some 30-40 minutes.  I have yet to find out how the good the story is for this actual game (halfway through), but it is safe to say that the story is, at the very least, solid and stands up as more than just an excuse to kill literally thousands of aliens.  The cinematics definitely look nice, too.

The Soundtrack- This is another one of those games where I could see listening to the soundtrack elsewhere.  I really hope I can find an import or something.

I beta tested the game up until a few days before its release and while I thought Dark Age of Camelot was a decent game I wasn't overwhelmed by it.
First off, Dark Age of Camelot is an online multiplayer game and it seems to be more stable than some of the recent disasters that have been released.  One disclaimer to this is that I experienced bad lag (pauses or slow gameplay due to slow internet signals) in the major cities in the last days of beta testing because more beta testers were allowed in the game which makes me think that when the game is released it will only get worse.  If you're going to purchase Dark Age of Camelot I would check recent news and PC game bulletin boards to see if the company's servers are holding up and the game isn't experiencing too many bugs.
The graphics are definitely impressive and I would compare it to the game Asheron's Call with better resolution.  As a matter of fact, the game plays similar to Asheron's Call with a set of rules resembling Baldur's Gate or any Dungeons & Dragons PC games.

Some of the races are large creatures such as trolls or small creatures like kobolds and are a nice change from the usual formats for swords & sorcery online games.  After the races though, the choice of professions for your character are very limited.  Essentially, you can only be a warrior, mage, thief or cleric with subtle distinctions occuring as you reach higher levels and are able to swear to different gods in the game who give you special abilities.
I didn't enjoy the setup for gameplay.  Many easy actions such as simply quitting the game require you to type in a command.  I felt the chat options were more technical than they needed to be and the chat box wasn't large enough to begin with.  Your actions are also recorded in the chat box and the game seems to be more oriented for the keyboard than the mouse.
It's fun to see some of the warrior classes allowed minor spells at higher levels but the spells that are provided don't match some of the online competitors's games.  The quests and adventures provided are difficult to find and most cities are very small.  It's almost like the game was perfected to look ""pretty"" while forgetting vast quests, subplots, NPC activity and other elements that make many online games enjoyable for months.  Also, if you are a gamer than enjoys playing solo, this might not be the game for you because it's oriented for group play with some clever options put in such as screens that allow you to find any players in your region that are seeking companions.
I would give the game a try to see if you enjoy it but in my opinion, it doesn't match up to Ultima Online, Asheron's Call or Everquest.","Played the beta version, looks promising but not spectacular",1002585600,37,,

The PlayStation 3 managed to stay around for so long because of the fantastic amount of quality games and innovative exclusives it had going for it.

This console features games in both 720p and 1080p commonly shown at 30-60 fps, it has Blu-Ray capabilities as well as USB media playback including audio and video (big plus). The PS3 also has a selection of both music and movie applications like Music Unlimited, Netflix, Vudu, Hulu and even more. At one point the PlayStation Move (Sony's motion sensing technology) was a point of emphasis but has since been backed down from.

The PS3 is relatively easy to set up, easy to use and offers great quality video and audio. While the XrossMediaBar has gotten a lot of criticism over the years, I personally never had a problem with it. The PS3 controller is much like the PS2's controller with the addition of a PS button, which takes you to a home menu, and the wireless function. One of the things the PS3 has had some problems with is loading games. In particular with titles like Metal Gear Solid 4, Grand Theft Auto V and Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, as they are so large, they virtually max out the consoles capabilities.

All in all the PlayStation 3 has been a good gaming console and has had some truly fantastic games and exclusives, but as time passes by and as the PlayStation 4 gets more exposure I think it will be thought of as a fond memory with seemingly outdated graphic and processing capabilities.",An Enduring Console and a Big Leap,1393804800,3,,

PC Gaming Headset, Heroes of the Storm theme.  The speakers include removable plates
Removable mic
PC splitter cable
Quick Start guide
Turtle Beach Sticker

The headsets are light and comfortable to wear and have a very nice look.  The headphone design and skin colors are based on the Blizzard Entertainments Heroes of the Storm video game.  I do not follow or care about the game, but the fact that the speaker plates are removable made it appealing to me.

The sound quality is good, but not necessarily mind-blowing.  For Win 7 users theres the audio enhancement option to improve sound quality, if needed.  The headset features in-line audio control, making it more accessible to control audio volume and to mute/enable the microphone.

The included splitter cable not only extends the headsets speaker cable significantly, but also is necessary to use the microphone on a PC.  This cable is not necessary for laptops or mobile devices (tablets, smart phones)

My main use of the headsets is for private listening and music.  I don't do much video gaming, but my planned use of the mic is for chatting over Skype with my extended family.
Ive never used a mic on my PC before, so I struggled a bit to test this.  The mic plug on the splitter cable is grey and the audio plug is black.  I plugged the gray cable on the gray jack in my computer, but I found out that the PC mic jack is pink!  Once I figured that out I got it to work and proceeded to test.
On Windows I recommend using the Playback Devices option (right-click the volume icon and select Playback devices), select the Recording tab and tweak the mic settings there.  You should see at least one or 2 green bars on the microphone device as you speak normally.  If not, you can select Properties and go the Levels tab to adjust the microphone and boost levels.  My other suggestion is to go to Control Panel\Ease of Access\Speech Recognition and use the Set up microphone option which will adjust the levels for you.

4.0,True,"08 24, 2010",A3T86ABQMA4JER,B000FRS9II,J. Lennon,"Just to state it vestigially, I'm a bit surprised I'm writing this review; usually I steer clear of  writing reviews on the most heavily promoted games, as they tend to have so many other reviews written  about them and I would expect mine to get overlooked, (especially considering this game's age) and I  generally have the mindset that quality yet obscure games deserve my focus more often, as they often  require someone to vouch for their quality more so than the biggest named shooters. Upon reading both a  critical and favorable review of this game roughly a day ago though, I thought neither represented it  very accurately, and so here I am...

Of course this is a review of Gears of War. I'm sure anyone reading this already has at least some broad  knowledge of the franchise, as it's become Microsoft's secondary flagship franchise next to Halo, and  possibly the most flagship this gen specifically. Those reading this who haven't played it probably want  to know, ""does it live up to its hype""? Very broadly, yes, though at least by my standards that is not  to say it isn't sorely lacking in some areas.

What I have to be most critical of is the game's plot, or even more broadly the singleplayer experience  as a whole. My personal experience thereof was a bit ironic; I bought the game under the impression -  based off other gamers' testaments - that if I were going to only like one mode, it'd be the  campaign/singleplayer... That couldn't have been less true... The plot elements involved with the  campaign are extremely bare; that's pretty standardized with reference to shooters - especially big-name  shooters at that - but a lot of players who are major fans of the franchise often describe the mode as a  ""must-play"", and just being totally honest I didn't even play fully through (I played roughly halfway  through, so I'm assuming I have enough experience with it to provide an objective take on it).

In addition to the weak plot, most of the characters are depicted incredibly flatly and/or  prototypically characterized, The only exceptions per me are Kim and Baird... The former, while he is a  bit bland, comes off iconoclastic as he's Asian yet still very capable of holding his own in a fight,  and the latter proves genuinely funny a few times during the campaign (albeit this humor comes off a bit  unrealistic considering this nightmarish universe the characters inhabit). Fenix and Dom, the game's  protagonist and deuteragonist respectively, can very simplistically be defined as general tough guy  prototype, and probably blandest character in the game respectively (which says a lot considering none  of the characters - as already mentioned - are that well fleshed out). This is also a trait standardized  as far as shooters go, but the gameplay is also extremely linear... Linear gameplay works well for some  games, but the extreme nature of this game's coupled with the very bare plot and paper-thin characters  grants this game almost no replay value only encompassing its singleplayer mode...

So I've been thoroughly critical thus far, and yet this game will receive a reasonably high score by me  anyway... Why is that? The multiplayer gameplay is awesome. There's a lot of arbitration to some  weapons' power levels (most notably the shotgun) but otherwise the multiplayer is really concise,  generally fun, and very much in a league of its own with reference to innovation (third-person format,  no respawns, the nature of downs and/or revives, really unique weapons, active reloads, etc.).

This might come off pedantic to some people, but I myself am especially partial to the Hammer of Dawn as  far as power weapons go... You aim a beam at any surface outdoors, and after a bit of time having  satellites align, said satellites fire a vertical energy blast from above... Generally the initial blast  is enough to kill whatever enemy one means to target, but if that isn't enough the player can also keep  the blast continuous for 10 - 20 seconds while dragging it along the ground to deal just a bit more  damage, often that deciding an enemy's fate... I don't mean to come off ludicrously specialized focusing  so much on that, but until you've used the hammer, you can't fully know how awesome and unique it is  contrasted with most shooters' weapons sets. The boomshot also feels both familiar and unique at the same  time, being essentially an amalgamated grenade and rocket launcher... Despite it often being able to  grant players an instant kill, it also seems like a balanced part of the game as it only allots the  player two shots (which encourages calculated and conservative use of it as opposed to the ""blow up  everything in sight"" mindset that other shooters might imply).

Overall the sound is worthy of praise... Just to get it out of the way, with reference to the  protagonist being very dull and prototypical, per me John Dimaggio's acting is the weakest in the game.  I'm aware his natural pitch sounds similar enough to his voice in the game, but for whatever reason he  sounds like he's trying greatly to come off hardcore, which per me comes off pretentious ultimately.  Overall the rest of cast is great though... Of course there's Robin Atkin Downes as Kim, (you have to  respect an actor's versatility when they're an Englishman voicing an Asian American character) Fred  Tatasciore as Baird, (his voice and style of speech are always so dynamic hence the praise there) and  Michael Gough as Carmine (I was amazed to find out he was also the voice of Tassadar within Starcraft;  he's got an incredibly broad range and so of course I have to grant him praise). To reference the  Locust, the primary antagonistic forces, they're wholly voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, (who else can achieve that perfect guttural pitch) and their queen is voiced by Carolyn Seymour (I don't have an extensive knowledge of her voice acting, and from what else I've heard her style of acting within this game is exactly the same as others... That upper-class English accent is both hot and fearsome at the same time, hence her acting being good by me too though).

The score judged by its own merit is possibly a bit overrated per me, though it's utilized within a very  intelligent fashion within the singleplayer (only becoming more prominent while in the midst of an  actual firefight). Some of the sound effects - notably the sound of chainsawing an enemy - also give the  game some very distinctive character contrasted with the ultra-realistic trend of a lot of other modern shooters.

Anyone broadly familiar with my reviews knows graphics are what I generally focus on the least, though  this game's graphics are nice... They fit the modern quality of this gen, and yet the lighting isn't too  harsh (generally) and the textures all look very smooth and realistic (the graphical nature of Halo 3  for instance, is a major reason I actually preferred Halo 2 over it, despite featuring ""outdated""  graphics). The character design is pretty thorough, and generally things just look nice.

To summarize, anyone expecting a singleplayer experience that's a lot of fun, features a compelling plot  and/or characters, and offers a lot in the way of replayability, will probably be disappointed (despite  what most other gamers will tell you). However, anyone expecting a shooter with a multiplayer mode  that's truly unique, somewhat competitive worthy, still active online, (even after four years, which by  console standards is very lengthy indeed) and truly fits the definition of ""next-gen"" needs to pick up this game.","An Awesome Multiplayer Experience Somewhat Marred by an Extremely Linear, Lackluster, and Generally Overrated Campaign.",1282608000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

First off, this is obviously the sequel to the hugely popular initial Halo game. You are Master Chief, a space marine who is sent out to battle the enemies. You are fighting the Covenant, who are your main foes, but you also run into the Flood, who are a space parasite that wants to eat all life. In addition, there are mechanical creatures on Halo who want to kill pretty much anything including the Flood. So each location and creature type has its own look, feel, attitudes and reactions.

The graphics are simply gorgeous, from the rippling water to the clouds in the sky and reflections off of surfaces. I love taking screenshots of this game. The music is also extremely well done, in that the quality is always very high. But it's a little bizarre to be going from new age lilting softness in one heated battle to high intensity rock music in another and so on. It doesn't necessary track to the location you're in, either. It's just whatever the designers felt like putting in.

The gameplay and plot is where this game really shines. Your characters that interact with you are simply BRILLIANT in how they each do what a real live creature would do. Grunts are my favorite - these little Covenant front-liners are brave and talkative when they're in groups, but when you whittle them down they suddenly turn and flee, shrieking at the top of their lungs. Your teammates leap into vehicles with you, either driving or shooting depending on your preference. They'll come alongside you to give you support, and duck for cover when appropriate.

The quips the characters come out with mid-battle still make me laugh out loud. In one sequence you are the covenant Arbitor and are working your way through a room. You come across a pair of grunts and a jackal under attack, and take out the enemies. The grunt comes running to you in glee, shouting, ""Arbitor! My savior!"" Then he pauses and adds, ""Jackal, say thank you to the Arbitor!"" :)

The cut scenes are equally as brilliant and are truly movie quality in the interactions. The timing, dialogue, everything is great. The little touches are everywhere. In one sequence, the Sergeant is preparing his troops to get ejected in pods down to the surface of Halo. He walks past the Master Chief's pod and thumps twice on it, as if to say ""All OK in there, ready to go?"" Right on beat, you see Master Chief inside his pod, thumping once back in response. You really forget that these are just computer generated characters.

Multiplayer is the stellar addition to this release and there are reasons to be thrilled. You can play on a large variety of maps, in a number of styles, and there is even going to be downloadable content in the future.

That all being said, there are of course a few non-stellar aspects to this release. First, the ending SUCKS. The first one was bad enough with its ""Oh I bet there is another Halo out there"" so you don't even feel like you really saved the world. In this one, not only is it not a ""you're done but it's not over"" ending - it's pretty much cut off mid-battle! That is INCREDIBLY frustrating for a gameplayer. Obviously they want you to buy Halo 3, but that's going to be a year or two away. Can't we have some satisfaction in the meantime?

Next, the game is really short, even on normal mode. We had a friend start the game up Sunday morning at about 12:30 and he was done with the entire game by around 8. You can have fun replaying it on the harder levels, but that's a rather quick game.",awsome game would recomend it to anyone,1297814400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

2.0,False,"11 4, 2011",A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ,B0053BG3NY,Gaming.Fit,"The original Motion Sports was released about a year ago for the Kinect. The concept sounded great--simulate real sports, and use realistic graphics to immerse the player in the game. And instead of using controllers, allow players to control the action with their body. Great concept, but the execution on the Xbox just fell short. By virtually all accounts it was underwhelming.

This year, Ubisoft is at it again, but instead they've released MotionSports Adrenaline for the PS3, Wii, and Xbox. Their focus this time is on six ""extreme sports"".

As you start each activity, you choose whether you're left handed or right handed, and then calibrate your Move controller by holding it at shoulder level, at hip level, and across your belt line, just like with Sports Champions. The controller accuracy and precision, not surprisingly, is pretty good. I wish I could say the same about the gameplay itself.

Here's my take on each ""extreme sport"":

1) Kite Surf: Here, you're kite-surfing. You hold the Move controller sideways (you only need one) and you ""steer"" by tilting your hands as if you're steering a wheel. You jump by holding the ""T"" button and raising your arms. You can get a speed boost by holding the ""T"" button and pushing forward. You can ""strike poses"" at various points (which they call ""hitting tricks"") and you can ""collect coins"" to earn points.

While the graphics were decent and the motion controls were responsive enough, it just didn't feel like a realistic experience. I was expecting more of a realistic ""simulation"", but but at the end of the day it just felt like a video game that I may as well have been playing with the Dualshock controller, as the Move controllers just didn't feel natural at all.

2) Mountain Bike: Here, you're mountain biking, but the controls for steering, jumping, and accelerating are exactly the same as with Kite Surfing. In fact, except for one part where you need to ""steer"" your bike through a tight turn they're essentially the same game. Again, the best way I can describe it is that it felt like a ""video game"", but between the controls, the physics, and various gimmicks like ""collecting stars"", it really draw me into the experience nor make me feel like I was immersed in the world of mountain biking.

3) Wingsuit: In this game, you're skydiving. The controls are slightly different for this one-you steer by holding your Move controller out to the side and tilting your body left or right. You can ""drift up"" by holding the ""T"" button and raising both your arms, and ""draft down"" by lowering both your arms. To speed up, you press the Move button. You have to contend with wind gusts and rock formations, and again you can collect points by striking poses and collecting coins.

This game lasted far, far too long and once again, and yet again something about the controls and the physics of the game was off and unrealistic. To be honest, even the silly ""flying chicken"" game in Wii Fit felt more like ""real flying"" than this did.

4) Climbing: This is a rock climbing ""simulation"". You're climbing the face of a mountain that happens to have ""handholds"" all over it. To climb, you grab onto a handhold by reaching out to it with your Move controller (whether to the side, or diagonally up) and making a ""grabbing"" motion. Some handholds will be out of reach, so you need to ""flick"" the controller to jump to them. To drop down to a lower handhold, you press the Move button.

This is one I really wanted to like, but at the end of the day the ""flicking"" really didn't feel like real rock climbing, plus half the time my motions wouldn't register properly.

I guess they wanted to add a little ""excitement"" to the game so there will be the occasional ""earthquake"", where if you have enough ""adrenaline"" stored up, you can press the ""T"" button for a ""shield"" which will protect you from them. Again, I didn't find the experience very realistic.

And worst of all, once you reach the top, you're not even rewarded with a view.

5) Skiing: I've been pretty harsh on all the games so far, but I found skiing to be the one bright spot of the game. Finally, I felt like I was really skiing. The controls were intuitive-you hold your Move controller in front of your like it's a ski pole and bend your body left or right to ski downhill. You can accelerate by intuitively pressing T and pushing the pole.

This is one I really enjoyed, as everything worked together-the graphics, the physics, and the intuitive controls. I even broke a sweat while playing. I only wish the others were more like it.

6) Kayak: With Kayaking, we're back to a rather unfulfilling experience. Again, the controls just don't feel very natural. You use the ""steering wheel"" method of steering. You can paddle by pressing the ""T"" button and moving your control like a paddle. But you can't do both at the same time (like you'd do in real kayaking). There are other oddities-you'll occasionally get swept into a whirlwind, and to escape you need to ""strike a pose"". Again, things like this kind of detract from the realism.

Here's a problem I have with all the games in general. With the exception of skiing, they just didn't feel realistic. For most of the games your on-screen character just seems to proceed on the course without any kind of effort from you, the only thing you really do is jump and steer to collect ""coins"". In this sense, it just feels more like a 3-D version of Pac-Man than an ""extreme sports simulation"".

To me, the whole point of calling this franchise ""MotionSports"" is to help us experience what playing the real sport must feel like. As I mentioned a couple times, for most of the sports the controls just weren't realistic and it almost feels like the game was designed for a Dualshock controller and the Move controller was just thrown on as an afterthought, and not a very good one at that. For example, instead of making me press the T button and throwing my arms up to make me jump, why couldn't they just--make me jump?

Something else I didn't really like were unrealistic gimmicks in the game such as striking poses and collecting coins. To me, it just felt like the developers knew their simulations weren't very good, so they added these things to make it feel like you're accomplishing something. I wish there were more simulation games like Sports Champions, where your reward is playing the sport itself, not collecting points.

Finally, one very, very annoying part of the game is the Degree ads all over the game. I don't mind a little product placement when it's subtle and even tongue-in-cheek, but if a company is going to get a sponsor to plaster their logo all over the game, then for heaven's sake don't charge $49.99 for the game.

I hate to say it, but I just can't recommend MotionSports Adrenaline. If you're a die-hard fan of any of the sports, you may enjoy the graphics and the concept of being able to somewhat simulate the sport. But from a ""fun"" perspective, with the exception of the skiing game I really didn't find any of the games compelling enough to even play more than once or twice. There wasn't even very much of a workout component, something I was really hoping for when I first picked up the game.

In short, what could have been a innovative foray in the world of virtual reality sports just ended up being just another tired video game that happens to support motion controls. Here's hoping that if there's a third version of MotionSports, Ubisoft spends more time investing in making it more realistic and immersive.","Not the virtual reality simulation of ""extreme sports"" I had hoped it would be",1320364800,26,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The Bad: Level layout can get boring and tedious, some poor difficulty balancing, game needs to be constantly connected online, requires dedication to get the best loot, loot isn't all that great until higher levels

Diablo III is one of the most long-awaited games in history. StarCraft II and Duke Nukem Forever are in the same boat, but Diablo III is something else. Everyone who played the last two games were either in high school or college at the time and are now in their 30s and 40s. 12 years in the making with so much turmoil and history to write a novel about. Now that the game is finally out is it any good? Blizzard surprised us with StarCraft II and how good that game is, but can they do it twice in a row? The answer is yes. The game has its fair share of problems, but they were mainly during launch with a plethora of glitches, balancing, and server issues. Most of the major problems have been patched now so I won't spend time complaining about that because I didn't experience any issues apart from the occasional server error.

The story in Diablo III is fairly good, but only people who played the last two will truly appreciate it. I found the middle of the game to be pretty uneventful, but the ending was great with a few plot twists. You play as one of many hero classes who is trying to stop the Prime Evils from taking over the world. Not just Diablo, but Azmodan, Mephisto, Belial and many others. One of the best things in the game are the many different locales from indoors to outdoors. The art style is absolutely beautiful leaving you with plenty of great scenery to look at.

Of course a dungeon crawler isn't one without a lot of loot and Diablo III has an endless amount. The best loot is at higher levels (60 is the cap) and on Nightmare difficulty. This is really a game for people who want loot. You can blow through the story and reach around level 30, but it will take another play through to get the best loot. Why do you want this loot so bad? To sell in the auction house for in-game gold or real world cash. That's right. Cash. People can bid on it or buy it outright, but don't expect anyone to bid on the crappy stuff. Only level 60 loot is really being fought for. I tried selling dozens of rare items throughout my play through and only sold one for $1.25. Really sad.

The best loot comes from bosses which are highlighted in gold. Main bosses give you the best stuff, but they can be tough as nails. Some bosses were pretty easy, such as mid-level bosses or blue sub-bosses. There were a few that just kept killing me, but I didn't die all that often. The penalty isn't very severe with just 10% durability of all your equipped items taken away, but you can always repair it at a town center. One thing I didn't do hardly at all was buy items. I always found the best ones as drops rather than at shops. I didn't even craft any items really which is a shame. I found this to be sorely wasted. I did like the new gem ability which will raise stats of items significantly. Weaker gems can be crafted into more powerful ones as well.

Of course you can take a buddy with you, but you really don't have to. This is only recommended on Nightmare difficulty, but most people will probably want to take a long break from the game and come back a few months later where the game feels a little more fresh. After I finished the game I felt I needed a long break because you are just clicking around madly while using 1-4 keys for your attacks. I sure wasn't disappointed here because there are plenty of abilities to learn; I just wish you could hotkey more of them instead of just four. I even wish there were some better AoE attacks because the last two acts throw a ton of tough enemies at you and you are constantly boxed in. I managed, but it would have been nice.

At the end of the day you are just clicking around furiously at everything that moves and trying to find the best loot in the game to sell in the auction house. This is a game for people who are dedicated. Sure you can enjoy the single player, but if you really want to experience the way Diablo was built to be played you must continue on in a second play through on a harder difficulty. Sure the game has good voice acting, some of the most beautiful pre-rendered cut scenes I have ever seen, lots of abilities, tons of loot, but in the end this is all this game is about. Looting, clicking, selling. If you don't like that then you will hate this game.

My biggest complaint would have to be the layout of each level is nearly the same. There is a fog of war for the map and you have to discover where everything is. There may be some side quests, hidden chests, and sub-bosses, but I found this tiring and kind of boring. What's here is great, I just wish there was a little more variety. Another thing I will complain about is the game's DRM. You need to be online at all times or it will boot you and you will lose your progress. I hated this more than anything, but Blizzard has successfully side-stepped pirates and I applaud them for that. Probably the only video game ever made that isn't pirateable. Other than this the game is great and well worth a purchase.

Side Note: Due to the flak I am getting on the comments I have to add this note. For people saying the game is boring and you just click around looting, welcome to dungeon crawlers, they are ALL like that. Secondly, people claiming this is a paid/fake review, it isn't! I wish I could get paid for reviews. It is sickening how when you write a review that people don't agree with they assume you're paid for it. I do this as a hobby because I love games, I don't get a cent. I am just being honest with the game and I am not a foaming at the mouth fan boy throwing a tantrum. People's expectations were too high for this game. It is a dungeon crawler, there is only so much you can do. The game isn't perfect and isn't what it could have been, but it isn't nearly as bad as these bratty fan boys are claiming. I for one am not a fan boy of Diablo I just think it is a fun game. I played through most of D2, never played D1, so that clears that one up. If you don't like the game don't play it! There's such a huge stigma with this game that people will start believing things that aren't even true about the game before even playing it. The game is good on its own.

As for the gameplay, it consists of mostly simplistic platforming, but it works great. I loved the environments and the interaction between the girl and fox.

Quick Review:  It's all about choice in Deus Ex Mankind Divided, and while it feels much like it's predecessor Human Revolution, the variety of ways to finish missions and achieve your goals is as vast as it is satisfying.  The graphics are better and the audio is well done (though the music is too loud to hear the voice-overs clearly without adjustment). There is no multiplayer.  I encourage everyone to NOT SPEND MONEY ON MICROTRANSACTIONS that SquareEnix has added.  I'm not knocking any stars off because it doesn't interfere with the game at all, but is still a dishonest and greedy cash grab from corporate.

Full Review:
After roughly 20 hours of playing, I feel like I can confidently say I think Deus Ex Mankind Divided is a great game.  Not perfect, but I already feel like I have received my money's worth.

Mankind Divided feels like a continuation of the previous Deus Ex, Human Revolution in all the positive ways.  New augments, more choices in how to finish missions, and you don't actually have to kill a single person to finish the game!  I'm currently working on my non-violent play through first and think it's fantastic.  There are consequences to everything you do.  For example, when I broke into someone's apartment, I was caught and they tried to find me.  They ended up pulling guns and being shot down by the police.  I lost a merchant that will never come back.

To start, there are three difficulties to choose from: Give me a story (easy), Give me a challenge (medium), and Give me Deus Ex (hard).  There is a fourth option for a hardcore mode once the game has been completed once.  I choose Give me Deus Ex because I wanted a challenge and let me tell you: I receive a good challenge.  Not once did I feel like I was cheated when I died.

Like the Elder Scroll or Far Cry series, there are a variety of ways to achieve your goals.  Do you go in guns blazing or as a silent killer?  Take the merciful route using non-lethal take downs and stun guns or sneak around using sound to distract the enemies instead?  Being able to choose my approach to fit my play style (or current mood) is a huge plus to me.  Not to mention that you don't have to kill a single character in the game, including bosses.  I chose the social enhancer augment so I could successfully win the conversation battles.

The first thing I noticed is that the music is LOUD.  I could barely hear the dialogue spoken during the first cutscenes (I watched the recap video).  I turned the music volume down to 60 and turned subtitles on.  Setting the music volume at 60 has given me a great experience so far.

For the first mission I was given two options for the first mission: Non-lethal or Lethal.  I went non-lethal.  Then, I was given the choice of a long range or short range weapon.  I choose the tranquilizer gun.  I found the coverr system great.  It's easy to navigate and enables you to quickly move around for strategic positioning.  I was quietly running from hiding spot to hiding spot without any mistakes.

There is an optional tutorial mode to get a feel for the controls and abilities.  Going into the tutorial doesn't affect the game and can be replayed as many times as needed.  Afterwards, you're put back in the game where you left off.  The controls took a little bit to get used to (I still sometimes mess up the crouch -- L3 -- versus item wheel -- R3 --) so the tutorial was a great way to get familiar with it.

Graphics are good, as expected of a next gen game.  But you can clearly see the FPS slowdown during some in-game cut scenes.  It was easily noticeable and reminded me I was playing a game, taking me out of the experience.  However, I did see cut scenes that didn't suffer FPS loss; not all cut scenes were created equal.  The lighting is fantastic, shining on various materials with realistic qualities.  Whether plastic, metal, leather, skin, brick, or other substance, it behaves as it should in real life.  I thought the skin textures looked realistic for a PS4 game as well.

The battery system is back, like the game before, and is both good and bad.  While it forces me to think about how I approach a mission and to use it sparingly when I need it, I felt there were times when it was detrimental.  I don't like that non-lethal take downs require you to have battery power.  How is the non-lethal take down any different than the super jumping or sprinting?

Experience points are how you get and use praxis to learn and upgrade augments.  Experience is earned from exploring, killing or taking down enemies, hacking, reading eBooks, and other events.  You are rewarded for exploring every nook and cranny, and thats what I've done.  I loved looking through the vents and trying to break into the various locations.  Weather I hacked the front door, went in through a window, or snuck in through the vents, there were always a number of ways to get inside the place I wanted to go.

The inventory from Human Revolution returns as a slot based system.  You can expand it, but you still have to manage it by moving items around.  You can upgrade your guns with crafting supplies or other expendable items like the always fabulous and useful multi-tool.

The augments from Human Revolution return with a few new ones.  The twist here is that it overclocks our hero, meaning he'll have to choose which to invest in, and which to shut down permanently.  Most of the augments were uninteresting to me, mainly focused on the action part of the game.  There are a few stealthy or hacker-y augments to choose from though.  If you like inflicting pain or being superhuman you'll likely dig the augments and might have trouble choosing which to shut down.

Hacking makes a return as well, and so far I haven't seen any real difference between MD and HR.  There are plenty of keypads to hack, but also computers to find codes or just read about people's lives.  Collecting data pads and other items (like ebooks) gives you deeper insight into the world of Mankind Divided.

The story seems standard fare so far, but what I really like about it with this game is that when you're choosing a response, you're not sure who to trust.  It creates a tense atmosphere of wondering if you're doing the right thing.  Also, the atmosphere is compelling.  You feel like you're being discriminated against and segregation is openly happening.  If you get on the ""naturals"" side of the metro, you'll be stopped by police when you exit because it's against the law.  One of the other locations in the game show you just how bad the augmented population is treated when compared with Prague, the main city.

Pre-order and DLC items can only be used ONE TIME and are SAVE LOCKED.  What does this mean exactly?  When you choose to take your item out of ""Storage"" (press L2 when in the inventory screen), you cannot redeem it again.  That means the pre-order guns I received I can only claim ONCE.  This is a pathetic.  I don't blame the devs, as they are likely to not have anything to do with this shady practice.

DO NOT GIVE SQUARE-ENIX ANY OF YOUR MONEY BY PURCHASING MICROTRANSACTION ITEMS FOR A SINGLE PLAYER GAME THAT CAN ONLY BE USED ONCE.  I'm sick and tired of this practice.  Vote with your wallets, please.  I think the game is great but detest some of the practices that the marketing team/corporate come up with.  It's a shame too, because Eidos, the devs, deserve props for this great game.

As for bugs, I've only encountered a single one during my playthrough and that was when trying to turn in a piece of breach software.  The game hung during the conversation scene and I had to shut the game down and re-open it.  Otherwise my experience has been very smooth.

I highly recommend this game to people who like stealth games, futuristic/sci-fi action games, games with choice, and RPG elements.

Yes... there were a few minor bugs, but they did not interfere at all with overall game play or enjoyment. Projekt Red also will be releasing DLC for AOK for FREE in the near future.  If I had one complaint it would be that the game ended sooner than I wanted it to.  Of course I said that about Baldur's Gate and that game took me way over 100 hours to complete.  Buy AOK, you will not be disappointed unless you are looking for the same old ""shoot 'em up"" or treasure hunt. This game is not for those who don't want to participate actively in the game world.

No, there are some things about the game that aren't perfect, but on the whole I found them so trivial as almost to be beneath complaining about.

No, the graphics aren't of the best - and I'm a graphics freak.  It's very hard to match voices with the graphic rendition, and with ""Murder"" they weren't of the best, but they WERE tolerable, GIVEN ESPECIALLY that the voice acting was so good.  Who could complain about the ""Hercule Poiroit"" - David Suchet - as THE voice of HP?  I'm not about to do so.

The device of using the plucky Antoinette as his ""legs"" was utterly delightlful, and gave the video game all the more validity in it's own right.  I should also say that I had no complaints about the other characters either.  They weren't perfect, but they worked!

Other minor complaints I might express are just that. Too minor to mention.

I have only given 4 stars because I am SUPER, SUPER PICKY!  If there were a 4 1/2 star rating, that is what I'd be giving it.  I found playing ""Murder on the Orient Express"" an utter DELIGHT, and I highly recommend it.  (Besides, I'd already ""read the book"".)  It is TRULY worth it!

though the mic does work, and had no problems with utilizing the tambourine my only real complaint is that the USB Cable length is too short when compared to my original Rock Band Mic (from RB1).

I fixed the problem by adding a usb extension cable to each mic.  This added an extra $5 cost per mic and gave me 3ft.  For 6ft it would have been a $5.50 increase and for 9ft, $5.80.

4.0,False,"02 17, 2009",A2M7CLVA0KIHQF,B0011TTQLS,J.S. Knapp,"As I've been asking this question forever and no one could give me an answer, allow me to fill you in:  NO, this game has not had any updates.  It is what it is.

I have an Xbox 360 Elite.  The Elite and Arcade units have an upgraded chipset, and see much fewer crashes than the other bundled units.  If you have an Elite or Arcade, you should be okay playing this game.

SupCom for Xbox uses quite possibly the most innovative and thought-out control structure I've seen yet on a console.  The controls not only make sense, but they're easy to LEARN, and they WORK.  You select your unit, press a direction on the D-pad to bring up a wheel menu, then use your left and right sticks - sometimes together as needed - to highlight an option which you select with the A-button.  It also has a relatively simple method to assign and select groups.  There's a short learning curve to remember which direction on the D-pad accesses which menu, but if you get it wrong, just press a new direction and the menu will adjust.

Unfortunately, the instructions that come with the game - as well as the in-game tutorial - do a lousy job of telling us how to actually play the game.  For example, we are never told how to make a level-3 construction unit build level 1 or 2 structures.  Secondly, while the game tells us we can outfit our commanding unit with upgrades, we are not told how!  In both cases, you access the unit's build menu, and use the right control stick to select an inner-wheel of the menu, which will change the icons at the outer wheel.  Once you learn this interface, it also becomes easy to use, but I literally found it out by accident.

Controlling your units is relatively easy, though the one thing that SupCom does different is that it stacks commands.  Each command to a unit is put into queue - it will perform that command after it finishes any other commands you've already given it.  If you want it to do something right away, you first have to hit the X button, then issue the new command.  This takes a longer adjustment than usual, as no other console-RTS games work this way.

I prefer skirmishing to a storyline, so I can't provide much insight there, but skirmishes work well, with the ability to play against the computer or friends, or against the computer WITH friends, providing a much-needed, coop-skirmish feature.

As far as cons go, there are a few.  The camera is weird, especially once the unit count starts to climb.  When zoomed all the way out, the cursor moves without the screen moving - much like a mouse on a PC game.  When you zoom in, the cursor becomes static and the entire screen scrolls.  Sometimes, however, when zooming in, the cursor becomes ""stuck"" beyond the edges of the screen.  You'll zoom in, and can scroll the screen, but there is no cursor, and thus no way to select units.  You have to zoom out, ""free"" the cursor, then zoom back in.  In addition, the zooming is very touchy - it's very easy to zoom far beyond where you intended to be.  And since there is no mini map, you can't just set the zoom where you're most comfortable and leave it - you'll be forced to zoom out from time to time.  Sometimes the camera will just jump around on you as you're trying to control it, causing you to end up viewing parts of the map you had no interest in viewing.

Once you get a feel for the controls and log some time with the game, this will become less of an issue - you get used to it.  But it still remains confusing and at times, frustrating.  You don't always have time to be playing with the camera.

The games visuals are... ...difficult to review.  Units look pretty nice up close, but seem to blend together at a distance.  Everything starts to look the same.  Level details are very sparse, with most of the maps simply being open space.  Compared to the popular Universe at War game - which has detailed landscapes and tons of scenery and foliage - this game feels rather barren.

SupCom's selling point - besides the fact that it actually works on my console - is it's control scheme.  No other RTS is as easy to play.  It can be had on Amazon for pretty cheap (my copy was less than $20, shipped) but again, if you're using any other console than the Elite or Arcade, you might want to stay away.

It almost, entirely, revolves around Organization XIII. Organization XIII has but one goal in mind and that is to fabricate Kingdom Hearts so they can reclaim their own hearts. I have to agree with the majority on one thing and, that is, if you don't know the whole story- you may need to go back to the very beginning and live the story. If you don't, and you're a newcomer to the series, you're going to be quite lost because the plot is rather deep and 'out there'-shall we say. Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days is a game that caters to the diehard KH fan only and it makes no bones about it.

The game, by far, is about the best looking game I've seen on the DS thus far. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it looks nearly as good as its' PS2 bretheren and that's saying something. Course, looks aren't everything I know. How does the gameplay hold up? Well- pretty good actually...the new Panel system adds quite a bit of strategy to things. However, I was quite annoyed at the fact I had to use the Panel system just to level up. That's something that should, automatically, be done when it happens, like in your more Traditional RPGs. I loved the fact that they made the battling more like that in the original KH yet am disappointed that there isn't more exploring. Going on missions everytime isn't so bad but I would've preferred to explore more like in the original game. It does, indeed, remind one of FFVII: Crisis Core and I applaud Dredspider & Luis Zavala for pointing that out. I do love the game, it was an absolute blast of a challenge to play, mind you. It just irritates me that we're visiting the same worlds over, yet, again..why can't we see some new worlds, Square? I know there's alot of Disney worlds out there that'd be perfect for this game(if you need some suggestions-look me up). It irritates me that there isn't more life breathing in any of these levels you're doing your missions on...shouldn't there be? This is a RPG, after all.  It irritates me that most of your missions were, basically, much of the same...I like a little variety and spice in things. Don't you???

Other than that, Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days is fun. It satisfied my appetite for KH, for a little while, at least. Now, I look forward to KH: Birth by Sleep for the PSP and KH:Re:Coded for the Nintendo DS. Then, onto Kingdom Hearts III.

The game features a much bigger variety of sports mini games than even Wi Sports did. You can go skydiving (and even have your mi's photo taken while doing so!), jet skiing, surfboarding, etc, while still being able to play all the classic Wii sports games. But what I love best about this game is the fact that the sports games are not exact replicas of the originals. They are new and improved. For example, if you're connected to the internet, online miis and miis on your hard drive can participate in the same games that you participate in. In addition, all aspects of the mini games are new and improved. Whereas Wii Sports had a trickshots bowling minigame which covered 20 stages, at the Wii Resort you bowl trickshots in 10 frames, just like you would a regular game. The game even adjusts to your level of difficulty. Say you fail to mark on a difficult trick shot, the game would lower you from ""Expert"" to ""Intermediate"" for the next few frames. Thanks to the Wii Motion plus sensor, the game can detect your movements with more accuracy than ever. The same is true for several games, such as Table Tennis, where you play opponents only that are on your skill level. I was very impressed with the bike race mini game, in which the player holds the Wii controller (attached with Motion plus) in one hand and a nun chuck controller in the other. You move your arms in order to make your mii ride his/her bike. You can test your skills in the short run (single race) or in the long run (3 or 6 day race in which you begin the next day where you placed the previous day and hopefully work your way up to the top day by day).

3.0,False,"11 25, 2013",A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B005LN5UOC,Raul G.,"As a PS3 owner and long-time gamer I've got more than a few Bluetooth headsets that I've used with my console. I started out with using a Motorola BT headset that I primarily used with my Motorola RAZR (that's how far back I've been using my PS3... whoa!). Graduated to a dedicated Logitech Wireless Vantage headset and finally settled on a wired Turtle Beach PX-21 most recently. I've also had experience in using Jabra, Plantronics, and Sony's official PS3 BT headset.

--------------------
SETUP:

Anyone who has ever paired a BT headset knows the routine - turn on your device you wish to pair to (PS3), go to Settings > Devices > BT devices > Scan. Then turn on the Gioteck EX03 and the device will appear as 'found' on-screen. Select the device, enter the pin: 0000 and the devices will pair. If you have any other audio input devices paired with your PS3 be sure to select the EX03 as you active input and output device. In simpler terms setup is as easy as any other BT device that I've used.

--------------------
DESIGN:

The EX03 looks like an adolescents BT headset. I don't mean that as a snipe or a bad thing, the device has a type of cool factor, though I wouldn't wear this on my ear in public. The EX03 is quite a bit larger than standard BT headsets that have tried to somewhat become as small as feasibly possible. The size can be attributed to both the ear look, the mic boom, and the actual earpiece/receiver. The design as I interpret it is more function over form.

The design of an over the ear loop and adjustable boom in my experience make this headset a bit more comfortable than traditional BT headsets, particularly those that don't have any type of over the ear support. This is particularly important during long gaming sessions. The boom is designed to adjust though within a very small tolerance. This is still important to anyone with a smaller or larger than average head. Additionally Gioteck includes a number of in-ear pieces so there options for comfort there as well.

Personally I found the headset to be comfortable for about an two hours before my ear really started to ache and bother me.

--------------------
USE:

In-game audio quality is a mixed bag. For certain this is a mono headset which is fine for communication with other players online, however, I found the audio quality sounded quite muffled. Especially compared to my PX-21 headset but even compared to my Plantronics BT headset that I primarily use with my smartphone.

Friends that I played with online had no complaints about my voice, background noise, or static.

--------------------
CONCLUSION:

This is a decent entry level headset. I'm hesitant to slam or praise this product as it does perform just not impressively so. If you can spare about ten more dollars I would recommend Sony's own PlayStation branded BT headset that in my opinion performs considerably better.

Notes:
There seems to be some confusion over what this headset will and won't let you hear. This is a headset for in-game communication with other players when playing online with your PS3. This headset cannot play back in-game audio or sound-effects.",Average Performer; There are Better Headsets for your PS3,1385337600,7,,

I got this last year along with the God of War Collection and Uncharted 2, and this game beats the rest of the RPGs on the PS3. There's a high replay value since there's so many different class systems, spells, abilities, and items to play around with. I've easily logged in over 100 hours on this game. The battle systems take getting used to but is fantastic after you get acclimated. The boss fights are challenging and require strategy and item/character matching. One playthrough would take you 35-60 hours depending on how many sidequests you undertake.

Some cons are that with the new PS3 firmware update (after May 2010), the game freezes a lot more, but BioWare is working to fix that bug. Another con might be the lag of graphics during high processed fights and skirmishes. But the PS3 handles this game well and it's a really fun experience.

I would recommend buying this game NEW as you get codes for DLC with the game like the Golem character and Blood Dragonplate Armor, otherwise they would be $15 and $7, respectively. There's also tons of other DLC for this including the so-so expansion to keep you busy for hours on end. The expansion is a rent, but I've played every DLC and expansion for this game (including the Wardens Keep and Return to Ostagar) and I've loved them all.

  With realistic racing sims flooding the video game market (Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport) it is nice to see a racing game this simple, and this accessible.  This game is about fast cars, and brain-rattling car crashes.

  Burnout 3's racing is very straight forward, and rewards you for driving dangerously.  Racing towards oncoming traffic, narrowly avoiding traffic (think Crazy Taxi) and drifting around corners gives you boost, which you can use to increase your speed even further (emphasized by a nice blur effect).  But driving aggressively and taking out your opponents is also rewarded: knock them into the side of the track or oncoming traffic, take them out, and your boost bar wil increase in size and fill up completely.  Crash again, and your boost bar decreases, bringing a nice balance to the gameplay.

  The racing is ridiculously fast, and drifting around corners and weaving through traffic is addicting.  Better still, it's made more intense by a huge sense of danger...  one crash could lose you the race.

  The crashes, as in past Burnout games, are out of control.  The cartoony graphics don't make them any less horrifying.  That's the series' claim to fame, and it shows.  Glass shatters, metal crumples, tires fly, cars roll out of control, grinding against pavement, smashing into anything in their path...  It's something to see.

  Best yet, it isn't just a racer.  In World Tour mode, you'll see all kinds of events (many that you can play on their own any time you want.)  These run from time trials, to Eliminator races (last car to pass the finish line each lap is eliminated until only one is left), road rage (see how many Takedowns you can achieve against three opponents until either the time runs out or your car is destroyed) to Crash mode.

  Crash mode is where the debris really flies.  Pick a car and barrel towards a busy intersection (with one hundred to unlock and choose from) and see how much destruction you can cause.  Once enough cars block the streets its almost disturbing watching the speeding traffic barrel into the pile-up.  Once a certain number of crashes have occurred, use the Crashbreaker, which causes your car to explode, causing more chaos, and allowing you to steer what remains of your car in slow motion towards power ups and money multipliers.

  Best of all, this game has a wealth of unlockables.  It keeps track of points you earn for driving well in races, monetary damage caused during crashes, takedowns achieved, and rewards you with cars, new courses, etc. for reaching certain goals.  This not only gives you great incentive to go back and play some more, it is a satisfying way to work for unlockables.

  This game, especially at its new lower price point, is highly recommended.","Wickedly Fast, Incredibly Brutal",1118102400,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

The good news is that everything that was great in the original is even better in the sequel. Gears of War has longer play time than the original and the combat is more intense and fierce. Co-op mode through the campaign mode is extremely fun, especially using the most difficult game settings.

The maps are very detailed and graphically beautiful, the challenges of the game run from very easy to nearly impossible and their are several interesting scenarios throughout the campaign. I like that the creators of the game didn't fall into the same predicable rut of having one boss character to beat in order to win the game, rather, there are several lesser bosses to beat throughout the game.

As with the original Gears of War, the most interesting aspect of the game is the online play with friends and others. There are several new online modes of play, my favorite being ""horde"" - where your team fights wave after wave of computer controlled opponents. Highly addictive and challenging.

I've seen the colorful boxes on store shelves, and kept thinking, ""That game looks way too girlish for a 30-year-old man such as myself...""  But last week I picked up Banjo Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts, loved it, and learned that this title was from the same developer.  I decided to give it a try.

You probably understand the premise of this game by now from other reviews - you have a garden, which you can easily reduce to a flat piece of dirt if you'd like, or turn it into a lush environment with trees and flowers and rivers, all while little pinata animals run amuck.  The instruction manual tells you how to handle the major chores, like getting pinatas to live in your garden, or getting them to mate, but it never really tells you WHY, or how to get started.  So for the first few hours, I zipped around aimlessly, trying to figure things out.  I'm still unsure on a lot of things, such as how to become a ""Master Romancer"" of a certain species of Pinata.

But the game is very colorful, it's ""cute,"" though doesn't make me laugh quite like Nuts & Bolts does.  It's challenging, and it does certainly whittle away the REAL hours of your life.  I've spent way too many ""work nights"" up until 12am!!  There's always ""one more thing I gotta do,"" or something else suddenly pops up that you have to tend to - I can admit it has a LOT more value off the shelf than games like Animal Crossing, which can quickly get repetitive.

But I have one, significant pet-pinata-peeve with VP:TIP.  SPACE. (The final frontier...)  My garden has a pond at one corner, with a river that stems from it and runs ""west to east.""  I have a few trees, two small areas for planting soil-only seeds, a patch of sand to attract crustaceans, and then a general fenced area where I pen up the pinatas I'm trying to ""romance,"" protect, or hide so as not to scare off other pinatas.  I have MAYBE 14 pinatas total - most of which are two-of-one-species.  I keep trying to manage my space - selling off one pinata home so that I can build another.  But I often end up having to sell EVERY structure (homes and fences) just so that the game will let me build ONE house...  It's ridiculous!  There's no way that a baker's dozen of animals and a few stationary trees can tax the computing power of the Xbox 360 to the point that the game decides I can't fit any more ""stuff.""  It becomes so frustrating because you end up having to sell off pinatas that you NEED to continue your food chain just so that you can build a house to romance a different species (of which you've been trying to meet the romance requirements for over an hour...)

This quickly - and I mean QUICKLY - spins VP:TIP into an ""almost good"" category.  So bad in fact that it lost a star simply based on this issue.  The Xbox could easily handle twice as much space with twice as much going on - look at those humongous sandbox games like Grand Theft Auto...

(as opposed to the last expansion, Road to Rome, which left me wondering why I bought it.)  Secret weapons brings not only a slew of new and cool weapons like, jetpacks, AA tanks, shotguns, Motercycles, and others, but also new gameplay modes.  There are now objectives to certain maps, which makes the battles seem more meaningfull.
I personally enjoy this game simply for the shotguns, jets, and aa tanks, but everyone has their personal favorite addition to the battlefield world.  If your looking for improved graphics, no luck there, its just an expansion, but if your getting bored with the old maps, and weapons this game is for you.
PROS:
More in depth maps.
More weapons including: 2 different kinds of jets, a cargo plane that is a spawn point, a tank with a naval gun attached to it, an aa tank, motercycle with a gun turret on the passanger carriage, shotguns, and more.
Objective based maps. (sweet)
CONS:
Not enough additions, I thought there might be more.
Too many glitches left untouched
Maps sometimes too small for the fast moving jet planes, making it hard to concentrate on firing, and watching the map limits at first.

Stafford III,"When I was living in Belgium in 1990-1991, I saw rally racing for the first time on Eurosport, and I just could not understand the appeal.  It was not until Gran Turismo 2 - and more recently Gran Turismo 3 - that I really began to have an appreciation for rally racing.  I have also begun watching Speed Channel's coverage of the World Rally Championship whenever I can, both for the action itself and to listen to the various languages.  Except for the lack of multiple languages (in the North American version of the game), World Rally Championship brings the excitement of the real-world World Rally Championship home... without the bruises when the driver rolls the car!!!
This game is FAR superior to Rally Events in the Gran Turismo series.  Gran Turismo 3 removed the only two stage-style courses from GT2; World Rally Championship sports about 80 total stages, between actual rallies and Time Trials - with some of these stages unlockable.  Special bonus codes - also unlockable - produce an interesting twist on the compeition.  Even many of the in-game movies - most of which provide an excellent overview of the real-world version of each rally from the 2001 season - are unlockable features.
However, the two-player mode really lacks in options, especially in views.  Car set-ups are incredibly simplistic, which is quite a letdown after playing Gran Turismo 3 and F1 2001 extensively.  While the navigator's instructions are often spot-on, there are some critical instances when important dangers are NOT mentioned, and are completely unseen from the in-car cameras.  Also, the learning curve between the penultimate and final rallies of the season (World Championship mode) is VERY steep, making it virtually impossible to win the Rally of Great Britain.
Overall, World Rally Championship is a wonderful game.  The release of this game combined with the excellent coverage of the real-world World Rally Championship on Speed Channel will hopefully bring rally racing some significant exposure in the States.",FAR Better than Rally Events in the Gran Turismo Series,1019952000,,,

However, the more I played it, I did get a little or even a lot annoyed.  For one, the camera control, whether automatic or manual, really messed me up quite a few times.

5.0,False,"11 24, 2010",A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00005AV8O,Mr. Math Expert,"Long considered the Holy Grail of all Bosses in any NES game, Mike Tyson is the toughest to defeat, and anyone's status as a gamer elevates once he has beaten the archnemesis. At least that's how I felt when I finally beat Mike Tyson for the first time in my life after so many painstaking tries. I remember in the 80's that the popular saying was, ""Mike Tyson is so hard that Mike Tyson himself can't beat him."" That's the reason why Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! remains one of the greatest NES games in the history. The game takes a lot of strategy, great timing, and superb reflexes. Once in a while, there is luck involved. As a kid, the farthest I got was Bald Bull II. Recently, now after picking the game up after so many years of absence, I finally got past him with ease and began to view Mr. Sandman and Super Macho Man with a greater challenge. Eventually, with many practice, they both got easier for me. Finally, the ultimate challenge had arrived for me. It would prove my standing as the ultimate gamer. I was determined to beat Mike Tyson no matter what, no matter how long it took, and no matter how hard it was going to be. After a few hours one day and then an hour the next day, I had tasted the sweet taste of victory. I was very glad to have beaten everybody in the game.

Just a few side notes about the game. Mike Tyson, I believe, has never played the game before. Ever notice that when Glass Joe raises his arm up, his eye becomes weirdly out of place? I've always felt that Doc is the most useless trainer I've seen, and he just keeps saying absolutely irrelevant things during breaks. At one point, Mac says, ""Help! Help!"" Then he answers him back with, ""Join the Nintendo Fun Club today!"" What the hell...thanks for the pep talk, NOT. Speaking of Mac's whiny complaints, every time he thinks that he can't win the fight or whatever, I end up winning it for him. Just a pitiful attitude. Finally, now answer me this...how is it possible for a 103 pound weakling to get back up after being landed by one of Mike Tyson's punches of death? That should have sent Mac either to coma or death. Why do you think the 200 lb. fighters got knocked out silly by Mike Tyson during the 80's fights? Oh yes...one clue to how to get the health bar raised after a break between two rounds is to press the SELECT button repeatedly. Sometimes, it's useless because I only got so little of it. But it's better than nothing, I suppose. All in all, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! is a true NES classic and is one of the hardest games in NES history. Below are the strategies in how to beat the game. Check my youtube videos per stage by typing in ""Mr. Math Expert Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!,"" so you can see what I mean.

Piston Honda II Walkthrough: Password: 032 730 8442. He is just like the first Piston Honda but much easier. Just dodge his punches and counter them back. At 1:00, he steps back for a second and then come back in. Now, this is really important: this must be done simultaneously, not before or after. As soon as he is in the process of moving forward, belly punch him. He is out for good. If you fail to get it done, then try it again at 2:00. Otherwise, get the stars and star-punch him.

Soda/Vodka Popinski Walkthrough: A lot of players thinks Soda/Vodka Popinski is tough to beat. But really, he is a joke. The biggest reason why is because his punches are slow coming due to probably a freeze glitch. Just dodge and counter punch all the way through the match. Occasionally, maybe if you feel like it, you can cover your head up to block his short punches until he is ready to do the massive power punch. At that moment he is set up to do that, there is a freeze glitch, and when that happens, get back to normal stance and belly punch him. Then delay a bit before you dodge his another massive punch. Punch him in the head to grab the star once before you star-punch him. He gets knocked out flat no matter how much power he has. One problem with this strategy is that Vodka may occasionally dodge the star punches. So, it's not very reliable as the dodge-and-counter method which I prefer more.

Bald Bull II Walkthrough: Bald Bull II is perhaps the second challenger of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, but he is not that hard. In fact, he is a great warmup for reflex practice which is absolutely required for Mr. Sandman, Super Macho Man, and Mike Tyson. If not for Ball Bull 2, it gets hard later. Basically, he is no different from the previous Bald Bull: just dodge and counter. Once again, he does the Bull Charge, but this time, he has the long version and the short version. The former, always dodge it no matter what, and the latter, belly punch him on the third hop. Over time, Ball Bull II is pretty easy.

Don Flamenco II Walkthrough: Again the washed up version of Rocky Balboa. Don Flamenco II is a bit difficult to fight because of the timing of his punches, but when mastered, he is easy because he takes a while to knock Mac off. He displays three type of punches: the straight punch, the back hand punch, and the Flamenco oval punch. Once you understand how each works, he becomes a joke. Pretty much, it's dodge and counter all the way through.

Mr. Sandman Walkthrough: Mr. Sandman is the third challenger of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! but really the first real, formidable challenger of the game. This is purely all about superb reflexes. The first 7 to 10 punches he throws are very tough, so learn how to dodge them and throw only one face-jab. Afterwards, he switches over to a simple back hand punch. Make sure to jab him in the head before countering and belly-punching him three times. Keep doing it. The best part of him is his Dreamland punches. You start dodging them three times; the first time he starts flashing, you dodge it right after, not just exact instant it happens, but just right after. Then dodge left two more times as you get hang of it. Now...this is really important. Most people do not realize this. After the very third dodge, face-jab him once and then belly-punch him ten times.

Super Macho Man Walkthrough: Password: 267 853 7538. Super Macho Man is the second real, formidable opponent of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! In reality, he is just like Vodka Popinski except that he is quicker in his punches. Sometimes, he is pretty much wide that it doesn't really matter how well you dodge. Just dodge and counter. The small version takes 4 face-jabs while the big version takes 6 face-jabs. Now, for the Super Macho Spin which always happens right after you knock him out (it never occurs randomly), just like how you did with Mr. Sandman, watch for that flash and then dodge right after that, never at the exact instant as it happens. While you are dodging his punches, do it rhythmically...not pressing LEFT rapidly and hard as you can which is a mistake. Just do it rhythmically every time you see his back turned around and then again and again. Then, face-punch him after it's all over.

Password: 007 373 5963

Finally, at this point, you will start feeling that everybody else is pretty easy compared to Mike Tyson. Really, he just has no equal. This is the ultimate challenge of the game. This fight took me a lot of tries to master...after losing to him and going to the Reset button and typing in the password over and over. It was a lot of work although building up a lot of annoyance and anger at the same time. Pretty much the key of the game is superb reflexes in the first 90 seconds. As soon as you see the flash, dodge fast and then hit him in the face fast. Listen, this is important...it takes practice and dedication. If he hits you on right side, hit him in the face right side and vice versa. I say this because if you do it wrong way, the damage is minimal. Now, right after the first punch, delay (and always keep holding the UP button in the entire time) a bit before you throw him a face punch. You will realize that these two punches will do more damage than a simple two quick jabs to the face. Keep trying that method until you have mastered it. It took me a while even though I had a hard time believing in it, but it will WORK. Remember...match his first side punch and then delay a bit before another face punch. Your number one goal in here is to limit yourself to one knockout (zero can be greatly accomplished, but it's an endurance match) of Mac. Get knocked out more than one time, you don't stand a chance of winning. Finally, after the 90 second brutal display of punches of death, Mike gives up and starts throwing the same repeated pattern of punches. Look for the blink of his eye and then dodge and counter. At this point, you should knock him out once by 2:40 although I recommend keeping his power bar to the bare minimum to the end of first round without knocking him out (it doesn't really matter at this point; what is important is surviving the first 90 seconds with one knockout or less; once done, you are pretty much in the clear for the rest of the way).

Now, as soon as second round starts, your biggest challenge is dodging his first ten super fast punches. Don't even think about countering back on any of them. As soon as he gives up, he reverts back to the same old tired routine from the second half of the first round with occasional punch of death (but this time, less damaging). He gets easier to work with, and you should be able to knock him out more often. At this point, you should be able to grab a star from time to time with a delay punch; I am not sure how it works, but they do come nevertheless. They are valuable in terms of reducing his health bar, but the star punches just have to be timed at the right time. Finally, there is an odd pattern coming from Mike Tyson. Most of the time, I get frozen out because I wasn't sure what to think of. Honestly, this is the greatest chance of the entire match to knock him out right away. As soon as he starts blinking both eyes, star-punch him in the face immediately to knock him out for the second time. As soon as he comes out, it's a race to third knockout before the bell rings. Keep up your patience, and don't lose your form. It's not over yet, and don't celebrate yet; just keep at it before you finally get it. If you get to third round, it is actually easier because Mike was never known for going the distance. Pretty much the best hope for a win is one knockout in first round, two knockouts in second round, and at least one knockout in third round to reach 5000 points to get a favorable decision.",Brutally Tough.,1290556800,2,,

Jurrasic Park is one of the Genisis's lost gems that is quite possibly, the greatest Jurrasic Park game ever made.  Warpath, the countless Game boy games and all the others have tried and failed to be as fun as this game.  The premise is simple, play as Dr. Grant and escape the island while trying to avoid getting eaten.  As the Raptor, fight to escape the island and reach the mainland.  Each charachter is a lot of fun to play as.  When you are grant you will traverse a river in a raft, romp through a volcano and more.  As the raptor, you attack humans (So much fun!) eat compys and try to kill grant.  Each charachter traverses through jungles, the power station, sewers, canyons and finially the visitors center.  The graphics are outstanding, they still look good even today!  The graphics for the dinosaurs are even more spectacular.  You can see each blood vesel, every tooth, which means that these beasties are extreamlly lifelike.  The raptors even learn from your actions and adapt in the later levels in the doctor grant stages!  The music and sounds are also very good, with moody jungle music, exciting river music, and a very cool Visitors center track.  The sounds of the dinosaurs are very good, they hoot, growl and roar (So realistically you will be terrified when you meet the T-rex !)  Granted, this game is not without its problems.  The main problem is dificulty.  In the Grant levels, you have to fend off hords of dinos at once, figure out some nasty jumping problems and survive the final battle.  The raptor's main problems is jumping.  Some jumping sequences are very difficult to compleate (Especially in the nasty sewer level).  The final battle for both charachters is extreamly difficult.  With the raptors, you have to hit a certian area, which isint to hard after some experementing, but with the Dr Grant battle, its almost impossible to figure out what to do!  It took me over 2 MONTHS to figure out what to do.  Its that hard.  Among the smaller problems is that there are no save points, so if you die only 1 step away from the end you have to go back to the begining (and the levels are very long) also the T-rex dosent show up enough.  But this is still a classic game.  Its reason enough to keep you genisis.

First of all, the plot is the same as SNES: DK and Diddy were kidnapped by K.Rool and it's your job to save them.  So I won't go into the story.  The controls, music, and sound are what really bother me.

The controls: well, I played this game on the DS.  Its controls on the DS are maddening; when I expect to run, I jump.  When I try to use Dixie's hair whip, I jump instead.  Although DS' control layout is different from the GBA's, it is not the system at fault; it's the game.  After all, on the back of the game box, it says only for DS and GBA; you'd think that Rareware would try to make the controls suit both systems.  But instead, it takes around ten minutes to beat each level as you are struggling with the silly control layout.

  The music.  YIKES.  Try the winter level on the first world; what the heck, are there drunk monks singing in the background?  On the SNES version, the music was great; it played along with the level's surroundings and whatnot.  in this game, it is as if the music is meant for 3-year-olds.  It is too happy.  Even on the gloomiest of levels, music remains happy and friendly.  The overworld music is the only piece I remotely enjoy listening to.

  The sound effects are really annoying.  Those kremlings that hop on their tails...those sound effects make me want to mute the game.  The sliding kremlings on the winter levels...thew sound is so out of place.  All the sound effects are so lame and goofy, again--is this game meant for toddlers or what?

Overall, the game was an okay transfer from one system to another--but I would recommend the SNES version over the GBA one anyday.",SNES version is better.,1135641600,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

There are 5 races you can play as: Human, Verran ( a human-like species but with long ears like a rabbit), Nu Mou ( a great magic using race), Baanga ( a lizard-like race, just don't call them lizards!) & Moogle ( a standard species in nearly all Final Fantasy games ).
To level and gain new abilities for your Clan( party of group members in the game, a maxium of 23 at one time ), your Clan must study abilities from weapons, armor, magical items, etc. Each ability is put into a class for each character which is called a Job. After mastering 1,2, or even 5 kinds of spelles, techniques, skills you can move on to another Job and use combo of two classes and become even more powerful.
The battle system is turn based, which means you move your character, attack, use a spell, etc, then face a direction to end your move. It may seem easy enough so far, but The Judging System can mean the victory or defeat of your clan. Every battle has certian rules, for example, lets say Missle attack are banned from the fight, you will be penilized for using a missle( arrow attack ) but if you use the opposite of missle ( which is swords ) you will be rewarded with a Judge Point (JP). JP's can be used for Combo moves which deal masssive damage & with other characters which could lead into the hundreads of damage points, maybe even thousands... JP's can also be used for Totema, massive summoned creatures you get for progressing through the game, but I won't spoil any more than that.
Overall this game is one of the best RPG/Strategy games EVER!! It's addictive as hell & fun as hell. For only $35 its worth any penny, every Game Boy Advance (or SP) owner should pick this up. You won't regret it.","100+ hours and I'm not even half way through, AWESOME!",1078704000,5,,

The game is a lie...there is no point to getting to the center of the galaxy...it just backpeddles you and forces you to start at the beginning again. waste of time and space.

Everything I thought it would be. I currently have 30+ hours into the game, and am in no rush to even get to the center. At first I was a bit overwhelmed, as the game doesn't even tell you how to name planets or creatures outright, but it's such a joy exploring, relaxing, and discovering new creatures, getting more inventory space, new ships, learning languages of the (won't spoil the number) alien species, and more. The environments are so breath-taking, colorful and beautiful. One planet, that i named Utopia Earth (in the aptly named Milky Way system), is still my favorite, and i have fond memories of it. I remember having my ship attacked by pirates and destroyed once, and while i didn't know that i could go back to the grave of my ship and get my ship inventory back, i quickly found myself on a highly sentinel-heavy/hostile planet, with Gravitational orbs littered all over the ground. I racked up on about 18 of these, and while they alert the elite sentinels, I would hurry back into my ship or a nearby shelter and wait mere moments for them to deactivate, and made all my loss revenue from my ship attack back and then some :), about 600,000 credits profit in just an hour that one time :)....anyway, i digress. I already have so many stories with this game and i encourage anyone that seeks adventure and exploring, and loves sci fi movies, to get this game right away. I usually care a lot about metacritic reviews, but for the first time ever, i completely ignored critic reviews, and was not disappointed.

the minor nagging gripes i have however (though they do not detract from how much i love this game) are:
- The U.I. could be better designed and moreover easier to navigate; let us use the control pad to select items and not have to hold X on items we want to interact with. the joystick isn't intuitive enough for maneuvering about your inventory.
- fix gameplay crashes. in my 30+ hours i've had 5 crashes on PS4 so far, and on this generation of console, crashing isn't something i'm accustomed to, nor do i think it should continue being an issue.
- lastly, i would like to see even more varied architecture (super sci-fi'ish towers, and even more developed cities with their own theme, rather than your standard huts, and buildings that are 95% the same on every planet you encounter. i would also like to see taller mountains, and deeper canyons (like what exist here in america alone)
P.S. I desperately want to be able to stack the Atlas Stones i've collected...they rob me of so much inventory space and i'm trying to save them...i have about 6 so far.

This game has many of the good classic features of the older Medal of Honor games, in an updated package with great graphics and sound.  Controls are easy to adapt to, not overly complex, and the missions are straight forward, yet challenging...they are a nice balance, great for 30-somethings gamers like me, who prefers a simpler game format, yet enjoy a challenge of a fairly advanced AI from the enemies.  When I say ""simpler"" format, I by no means mean ""simple"" game...more along the lines of that this game focuses more on what a first-person shooter should, shooting the enemy, with minimal side activities...unlike some other first-persons that have you tiptoeing around motion-detectors and sentries, and going on what essentially amounts to a scavenger hunt for about 10 hours in order to get past one level.  That is not fun for me, if that is fun for you, this is not your game.

Some of the pros include : Weapon power ups - as you make more kills with a weapon, a meter fills up and you upgrade that particular weapon 3 times as merits are earned (marksman, sharpshooter, expert), and you earn things like a scope, or a larger magazine, or a bayonette, and other items for your weapon.  As I mentioned, the AI is descent...the enemies are not stupid and do not seem to follow patterns in most cases, some will actually stalk you and hide and ambush you.  Taking you through various real-world WWII battles (and some fictional) in multiple locations is pretty cool, and having control of where your paratrooper lands can make for a different battle every time.  There are a few cons, but not many.  I would just like a little more depth, and maybe more numerous shorter missions, rather than the way it is set up with a handful of very long missions.  Also, kind of a personal preference, but I do miss a couple things from MoH European Assault, and that is the ability to command the men in your group, and the ability to hold onto up to 8 medkits at a time for use later when you need them (instead of using the old trick of constantly going back to the furthest one away first and working your way up every time you need one).  One other thing that is kind of dumb is when an enemy charges you with a melee attack and starts hitting you with the butt of his gun, it kills you faster than actually getting shot or hit with a grenade, which makes no sense.

So many First Person Shooters on the PS3, and the system obviously will allow keyboard and mouse but the game developers won't do it. They know it is superior to the controller, because in online-multiplayer mode they have options that would ban keyboard and mouse users from playing with controller users.

This is the only game I found to support keyboard and mouse and I looked all over. A lot of people say why not just use PC if your that in love with it, and the answer is ""because I'd have to buy a $2000 gaming PC"". No compatibility issues with the PS3. Good graphics no problems.

Binding the keys is easy, highlight what you want to bind then hit ENTER and then hit the correct key to bind it. Done in the options/input area. It won't let you set a custom crouch key, and seems to be set always at ""C"", the only bad thing I could find. Maybe a patch will fix this or some other way around it.

Some notes about the game itself: You can play deathmatch, capture the flag, and some other modes like that in single-player ""Instant Action"" against bots, like the original Unreal. Also it allows you to set the difficulty of the bots, and add modifiers to each match, such as slow-mo, low gravity, and insta-gib, which is one-shot one-kill with rifles.

The campaign is pretty much just some talk and story surrounding the previous modes mentioned. Story <Capture the Flag> Story <Deathmatch> Story <Capture the Flag with Nodes>. The only thing I can note that is unique, as far as I've seen, that is in this version of Unreal III, you can drive and fight in vehicles during some of the modes like Capture the Flag.

The graphics are very colorful and sophisticated.  I would definitely approve this for adults.  I think it is too sophisticated for anyone under 10 only because the items asked for would not be in their vocabulary yet. It seems to come out of Canada as one thing you search for is a Maple leaf every few levels.  The characters are fun, they move, and the garden is beautiful as you buy more for it. I read a review that a user was frustrated because there was not enough money to buy anything for the garden. You have to keep playing levels until you accumulate enough money.  The beginning offers items for the garden that cost only $100-300. This is easy to get, but as the levels progress things get a lot more expensive I also read one person said it was too easy and they prefer a stronger challenge. I like the level of challenge on this.  You have to find things on the list posted on the left side, take your mouse and slide over the picture to find things, then click on what you find and it disappears from the screen and the money is created to your account.  The wording is tricky.  For example, they will ask you to find five ""bows"". Well, most of us think of a bow as something wrapped around a present.  But the game gets tricky here because a bow can also be a bow and arrow, plus regular bows. The one negative that drives me nuts is the top part of the picture.  Many times it is black.  In order to add more light, you need to tilt your computer screen down to enable you to see the things at the top.

  GAMEPLAY: So far, the gameplay is very addictive and unorthodox unlike the first. You get anything you want in the game, sometimes you find out your inventory holds weapons that you never even knew. Fun and gory, much better than TUROK. GEO-MOD is still there, more sufficient and better than RF1.
  GRAPHICS: Cleaner than the first faction and no slow downs in multi-player. TIMESPLITTERS 2 was a little crude on the graphics. RF2 is a XBOX game on PS2 in my opinion.
  SOUND/MUSIC: The sound is perfect, smart [...] remarks and high tech noises, screams, yells, and shattering glass. NOW HERES THE DOWNFALL to the game, the music. Its not the sappy danger music in HALO, but safe and pointless music in RF2 or, Calypso.
  MULTIPLAYER: Three words, NO SLOW DOWNS! You got that a lot in the first one, but since the graphics are better, you don't get any of that, so don't worry about it.

I would say it looks even better on the Vita, mainly because my tv isn't an OLED tv and the Vita's OLED screen looks amazing. And the game for both platforms is virtually the same with the exception that on the Vita version, if you pinch the screen you can zoom in or out on the game which is a cool addition.

My girlfriend loves this game. I get frustrated with it because I am impatient and kind of a caveman. This game can be unforgiving and pretty damn hard at times. Sometimes I will die 50 plus times on one level that should only be a 5 minute level because some of the level design for this game is made so you have to play it perfect or you'll die. Some levels the screen moves and you have to keep up with it and if you don't, you die. So your timing has to be perfect. I've watched my girlfriend play a 5 minute level for an hour because she wanted to collect everything in it, which you need to do to unlock the 60 plus levels.

This game looks like you're playing a traditional 2D animated movie, it is hands down one of the best looking games I've seen, has amazing music, is responsive in its controls and is really fun. It's multiplayer too which is great. I know some people won't be patient enough for this game (like me at times) but it really is worth all the frustration. I am not a Rayman fan, aside from some Raving Rabbids games, this is the only Rayman game I've actually played and it blew my mind. It's one of the most charming games I've ever played, has some of the best level design in a 2D side scroller I've ever seen. I don't like Mario games, but if you do like Mario games, I think you'll like this even better. The flying levels and underwater levels are borderline jaw dropping.

 This game was the sleeper hit of 2011, look it up on Metacritic, it's like the best scored game of the year next to Skyrim, Uncharted 3 and Batman Arkham City, yea...it's that good. If you have a Vita, you need this game. If you don't and are thinking about getting this and have a PS3, get it for that.

Graphics are good for it's genre, spells look pretty nice, the bots in the game are semi intelligent.  It takes a while sometimes for them to enter the fight, so you're left solo if you're not puppeting them for about 10 seconds.  But who needs that if you can burn areas down?

There's a definate progression from low lvls to higher lvls.  In that the higher you get the more sense of power you have.  Unlike ES:Oblivion, where you could be lvl 38, but still have the same problems you had a lvl 1.

While would-be city planners have been clamoring for some quality city-building goodness all that we seem to be getting is a bug-infested steaming pile of garbage (SimCity), or a rerelease of the exact same game, but with a slightly different user interface (Cities XXL). This forces us to play games that are sometimes nearing two decades old since (SimCity 2000) because we are a sorely under-represented group of gamers

Cities: Skylines, pun intended but Colossal Order took on well, a colossal order when it decided to get into the city-building franchise since all that we, as gamers, have been provided over the last few years is nothing but trash and there were some big shoes to fill in the city simulation genre. Were they able to give us what we city-building fans have wanted?

In short, yes, Colossal Order gave us a city building game that was relatively bug free, balanced, gorgeous, and most important, it was FUN. Since SimCity's release I have been fervently awaiting some sort of gorgeous city building simulator where it actually worked and was something new since SimCity was such a massive let down. Come 2015 and Focus Home Entertainment releases Cities XXL only to find that it was more scam than anything else, given that it was the exact same game as Cities XL (we are talking the only difference being a user interface change). This left a very bad taste in our proverbial mouths as we were betrayed by the only two real city building studios out there and we had nobody to turn to.

Then Cities: Skylines was announced and as more and more footage was released we began to hope again and fortunately Colossal Order pulled it off. They gave us Cities: Skylines and it is glorious. From the moment you start the game you are greeted with a simple yet familiar start menu and once you start your game and choose your location you are thrown into a graphically stunning world. The hills rolling in the distance, wind blowing through the trees, the bustling sounds of traffic, the laughter of children, the smell of industrial waste and the gush of running water; it is all there and it is amazing. I still load up Littleton, a small hamlet set in Riverrun (an area in the game) that bustles with activity and children and fun and fires and crime and broken water mains and the best part of it all?

It still thrives and survives as the days go on and, given Skylines' actual working state, you can go and fix all of these problems and help all of these people and you can manage your city! It is everything that I have wanted in a city building game. The coolest part? All of these things look stunning. Simply gorgeous. I will admit, on my first flyby of my small town I was immediately reminded of the small puppet village from Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood; I loved it. Whatever I was expecting going into Cities: Skylines, this was not it, this was a surprise, a very welcome surprise.

The one thing that I have always had an issue with in a city building simulator is the music. It gets repetitive fast and while Skylines' music is not terrible I found myself turning it off and simply listening to the sounds of my city. Using a full surround sound headset, like the SteelSeries Siberia Elite or the Kingston HyperX Cloud 2 is a must-have for this game since it sounds absolutely sublime. Birds chirping, cars honking, construction equipment clanking, the rush of water, every aspect of everyday life is captured and presented in a clear and clean manner.

I simply love it, though I admit after an hour or two I tend to just zone out and find myself becoming easily distracted; there were a few times that as my city was building I would minimize the screen and forget about it only to come back after an hour and find that have of my town has been burnt down or I am suddenly running at a deficit (not unlike real cities). Possibly having more songs added to the soundtrack would help, as what is there is fun and airy, there just was not enough of it to keep me engaged. Having a few more tracks may help pass the time as you will have plenty of periods where you are just observing your town as it grows.

The staples of city building are all here, from waste and water management to power and traffic management though there is nothing new, outside of the ability to do things like dam up rivers and a few other caveats. As a whole though, Cities: Skylines is one of the most rewarding and fun city simulators on the market today, the only real downside is that we had to wait so long for it to come out. Fortunately you can see that Skylines is a love of labor as Colossal Order seems to have done the impossible by bringing fans a title that is relatively bug free while capturing the essence of the classics like SimCity 2000.

I can say with absolutely certainty that I have not been so fulfilled with a city builder as I have been with Skylines. It is truly a treat for those of us that are fans, though admittedly their tutorials could use some tweaking, as new gamers may not be as comfortable as those of us with city planning experience. Cities: Skylines is truly a wonderful game that is giving the fans what they need the most, a game that they actually deserve after paying their hard-earned money.",A great forward step for Cities,1429574400,5,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC Online Game Code'}",

Well instead of epic just fine tuning the multiplay from GOW1 they instead took the whole lobby system,shotgun system and play mechanics and trashed it. Also their are serious Lag issues here that in itself make the game a joke/unplayable again and again.

First off they had a great lobby system in GOW1 why did they alter it into this abomination. Your now waiting around for sometimes 10 minutes(yes ten minutes) and on a board where your guessing which game your in and who your playing. Its a crapshoot ! If you want to play ranked warzone well your out of luck here. Epic really dropped the ball here. Plus you can no longer just drop in unranked matches. The game from this perspective just go and play has been ruined I must say. The lag has you glitching all over the board  and you just want to drop out but even this you cant do ,you must shut down your xbox. Than go wait ten minuites to get into a game you have no idea what type or area it will be in.

GOW1 was great ,Epic could have just revamped and upgraded the maps ( as they did and they look really great I have to say) fine tuned the players(as they did again) added some great weapons( as they did to some extent,the balance here is a bot off) and the game would have been awesome. The shotgun makes an odd pop  noise here ,unlike gears 1 where it was authentic. Plus you cant shoot and run ,very little shotgun battles now. Some like that but really if you take out all the parts that made GO1 great than you are changing a great game not making it better.

The chainsaw duels if the other failings of this game weren't so great too would in itself almost ruin game. Gone are Gears 1 sneak ups with the shotgun and now its a free for all of shotgun attacks .Very lame and boring and takes the skill factor to about ""0"". And the duel chainsaw attacks pressing b like crazy is a joke too. Like playing ateroids from the 80,s. Just smash the buttons. No skill no fun just crazy.

All in all the game has taken all that was good about gears 1 out of the game,made it absolutely stunning to look at, added lag that is so frequent you drop out of games on rountine just due to that,has a horrible menu that you cant just jump in any more and play and you have no clue what you will be playing. Taking the shotgun and chainsaw elements out of the gears type gameplay is a real shame too as now its like your not even playing gears of war but a whole new game. If they wanted to make a whole new game than they should have by why did they ruin this one? The horde mode is fun but again severe lag,horrible menu and lobby system too.

If Epic doesnt at least fix the lag and flickering issues this game will never be played like the last one. I guess people will get used to the altered weapons but the lobby system I doubt it thats a  disaster. Just go play and you here ten people complaining about framerate,lag,weapons and the horrible lobby system. Their were never complaints about this while playing Gears 1, but now their is1 Says alot when you get ten people in room all complaing ,dropping out due to lag too

One of those titles was WCW/nWo Revenge.

Released during WCW's heyday (and roughly a few months before WCW's eventual downfall), the game showcases an astoundingly deep roster for game that came out in the 90s.  A total of 63 WCW/nWo wrestlers were divided up into different factions:  WCW 1 (main-event wrestlers), WCW 2 (mid-card wrestlers), WCW 3 (opening match wrestlers), WCW 4 (Cruiserweight wrestlers), nWo White, nWo Red, and Raven's Flock.  Further, there were roughly a dozen or so other wrestlers listed under the imaginary EWF and DAW leagues included in the game; these wrestlers were modeled after Japanese wrestling stars but had their likenesses changed to avoid copyright issues.

The controls of the match are simple enough for anyone to jump in and learn, but you have to understand the psychology of wrestling (and use the controls accordingly) if you want to go deep into the championship modes of the game.  Players use the B button to strike, A button to initiate a grapple, the d-pad to move, and the joystick to either taunt or execute a special move.  The player can differentiate between a weak strike/grapple and a strong strike/grapple by holding the respective button down until the move is executed.  The more ""worn down"" your opponent is, the better chances you have of successfully hitting them with a strong attack.  Yet if you try to initiate a strong grapple on an opponent who's not worn down, they'll likely reverse the attack and counter with one of their own.  So much like real wrestling, you have to wear your opponent down with the weak attacks until you move up and hit them with the strong ones (and also like wrestling, it's a good idea to generate a response from the audience by letting out a taunt while your opponent's down.)  Once your spirit meter is full, you can strike an opponent with a special move by initiating a strong grapple and then moving the joystick (or alternately using the joystick when on the turnbuckle if the finisher's an aerial maneuver.)  The controls also allow you to run, leave the ring, block/counter an attack, dodge an attack, and set your focus on another opponent if you're involved in a handicap or tag team scenario.

The game has several modes:  Championship, Exhibition, and Special Modes.  The exhibition mode is a singles or tag team match where the player can face either the computer, a friend, or a few friends since the game supports up to 4 players.  The championship modes allow the player to compete for the WCW TV Championship, the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, the WCW Tag Team Championship, the WCW United States Championship, and the grand-daddy of them all, the WCW World Heavyweight Championship (affectionately referred to as the Big Gold Belt.)  While the path to the Television titles and the Cruiserweight titles aren't terribly challenging, you will need to bring your ""A"" game when competing for the higher-tiered titles (or you can dial the difficulty down to Easy, either or.)  The special modes essentially allow the player to engage in specialty handicap or battle royal exhibition matches; with the former allowing for 2-on-1 or 3-on-1 battles while the latter will have 4 competitors fighting each other in the ring until one's eliminated, with the option to allow up to 40 contestants to enter the match.  You're also given a mode where you can customize the given wrestlers to either have different names or to have them wear different costumes.

The upside to the game is that it's still fun to play, even 15 years later.  As I said earlier, anyone can pick up the controllers and jump in, while the subtle nuances of the game don't take much effort to figure out as you go along.  The soundtrack is limited but I don't ever think anyone confused WCW's entrance music with the music that Jim Johnston (of WWE fame) has released over the years (with the only exception being Goldberg's theme.)  The graphics were a work in progress considering where the franchise was at by the time WWF No Mercy was released, but it was still leaps and bounds better than what most expected from the gameplay of other systems at the time (as a reminder, this game was released for a console that is three generations removed from what's available today.)  If there was one drawback from the game, it's the limited gaming options that exist.  Once you beat the championship mode, that was essentially it as far as beating the game was concerned.  There were no steel cage match options, tag teams were limited to 2-on-2 action, and the create-a-wrestler option wouldn't be introduced until THQ/AKI began releasing titles for WWF.  Other gripes I have are that you can't seemingly control whether or not someone interferes on your behalf and the fact that the CPU can ""Hulk up"" their spirit meter rather effortlessly while the player has to do all the little things right to make that possible.

With all that said, however, the game's fun factor makes it a legitimate ""must have"" for wrestling fans and should be considered by N64 fans who are looking for a beat-em-up button-masher where the top prize is the WCW Championship.  I recommend this to N64 gaming fans, wrestling fans, and people who watched wrestling ""when it was cool.""",A Popular 90's Wrestling Title That's Still Fun To Play Today,1390867200,2,,

First, we have been playing all the Rock Band and Guitar Hero games since they first game out. We are musicians and have a sense for how musical systems should work. We spent the months to fully evaluate Rock Band 2 against Guitar Hero 3 and to see how both held up for long term play. We also played both games both with other experience and novice players.

Despite my appreciation for Guitar Hero, I find Rock Band 2 to be head and shoulders better for many reasons. First, simply in terms of playability, it is much easier both for newcomers to pick up and for experienced gamers to easily use. New players who have trouble can be ""saved"" by their bandmates and the song can keep going. When you're all experienced and playing on harder levels, the wonderful screen layout means you can easily keep an eye on how the group is doing and help each other out.

I enjoy the way you progress through the different cities, unlocking physical gig locations, mixing up new songs, gaining helpers and items.

The character customization, of course, is awesome. I like the detail I can put on my avatar and smile every time I launch back into the game and bring her up.

The song list is great and I really enjoy that the songs I previously purchased for Rock Band 1 are right there, playable and waiting for me.

I love how the band bus in the background goes by with my name on its side, the tiny details in all of the gig locations, the way the characters interact with each other.

It all comes down to great gameplay, though. The game is simply SO much fun to play. I'll go back and forth between this and our other games, and while Guitar Hero can get frustrating, Rock Band 2 is always a joy. I'll play long past when my fingers are sore. It's that addictive.

I really don't have any complaints at all about this game. As long as I can keep downloading new songs, and buy the solid drum kit so that I have the best drum experience I can with it, I am completely happy.

Highly recommended!","After Several Months, Still the Favorite",1236211200,,"{'Edition:': ' Game only', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

4.0,False,"06 25, 2009",A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B0014ULQB2,Brian,"Red Faction remains on top of the massive destruction sandbox genre with Guerrilla. Mars is under iron fisted control by the once liberating EDF, who has now become a openly genocidal tyranny, because covering up mass civilian slaughters is apparently not worth the effort. You are Alex Mercer, demolitions expert and new found point man for the Red Faction, a underground resistance that you've been a member of for 11 seconds... wait, what?

Your missions are the basic story driven resistance on the run until you become the revolutionary juggernaut. Weapons are the basic plethora, either plundered from enemy dead or cobbled together from scrap materials, which are your basic monetary funding. The story however really, truly, desperately needed a runup, as you arrive on mars, brother dead, you, resistance, join, lead demolition missions. That story is rammed into your gullet in about as much time as it took me to write that sentence. At least doom had you on a boring seeming hunt for a lost technician before dropping you in the soup.

Prepare to destroy anything and everything in sight. Entertaining propaganda and spin stories from the controlling forces are hilarious, and background chatter takes a while to become repetitive, giving it a good feel of gritty, downtrodden rebels. Despite being instantly promoted to point man, you are treated with some disdain and contempt, and are sent off with sanctions to not screw up by just about everyone. Sabotage and insurrection actions actually make sense, and rather than send you against strongholds first, you can cut power, destroy fuel reserves and checkpoints, and generally cause mass chaos rather than charge headlong into heavily guarded meat grinders.

Graphics and audio are entertaining, though some buildings look pretty pathetic when they're collapsing, giving the feel of watching a scale model rather than a real building. Voices are well acted and appropriately emoted, though the blatant love interest side arc is about as subtle as a hammer to the face.

Nits are widespread, and cause enough teeth grinding to cost this a full five stars. Your sledgehammer is your best weapon by far, and theres not even a halfhearted explanation as to how you manage to plow through meter thick rebar enforced concrete walls with a lazy swing. You need scrap to get more pockets to carry more demolition charges. Hills with more than a 5% incline are unclimbable, and you can't exactly be sneaky when you have to plow through every wall rather than climb over them. Physics of building collapses are nice, but momentum physics are godawful. You can knock soldiers over the horizon with a well timed hammer blow, and an atv can knock a twelve ton dump truck out of the way like its a tinker toy. Alarm levels don't go down with finding good hiding places or killing off small patrols, but reentering a hideout with a small army on your butt drops it to zero. For a game that tries to be as serious as your basic medal of honor, it fails horribly in some portions of suspension of disbelief. There's no briefing on the main bad guys in your codex, or even on your sudden new found allies or superiors outside of loading screens.

Regardless of some major gameplay and story issues, the game is fun, which is what matters. Charging into HW without any backup or preparatory work will instantly get you killed, and while you definitely have superhero level endurance and amazing combat skills for a technician, this manages to be a game that will always make you giggle as you tear through buildings and army battalions like a wrecking ball. I'd still make this a rent first, as there are enough issues that can rub certain gamer types the wrong way.

I used it for about 20 minutes, playing Battlefield BC2 and I got terrible hand cramps/pain. The mouse itself is not very big/long. The grips supplied with it, are not different in size, the only difference is the texture, one is smooth, the other has more grip, it is more porous. The weight system is nice, but not very convenient to change, because it rests under the mouse's grip, so you must first remove the grip to access the weights.

The mouse has an onboard memory to store/swap profiles and macros. Problem is, in order to swap profiles, you must lift the mouse, press a button that's located underneath it and the plus/minus button on top of the mouse at the same time, not good IMO; same applies to to the mouse wheel, if you want to swith to the rapid scrolling, again, you have to lift the mouse and press the another button under it.

The software is basically the same as other Logitech products, easy to use and set up, nothing too complicated. From there, you can adjust the DPI level/speed, how many levels of DPI you want as you press the plus/minus on the mouse. Pretty neat. Something I noticed though, I could not get a smooth DPI level for my games, it was iether too fast or too choppy, I got a headache from looking at my screen, which I never had before.

Finally, the mouse, as good as it could've been, falls short in convenience, the idea is great, but the placement of the buttons for profiles switching, etc, is the worst I've tried. Again, the grips are the same size, but different textures, for somebody with big hands, this mouse is not a good choice. The weights tray/mechanism is under the grip, making weight swaping a pain. Logitech should've stayed with the original weight design they developed when the first G5 mouse came out many years ago. Hope this helps.",Not for big hands.,1302652800,,,

5.0,True,"03 12, 2010",A2GJQ12A74YLAU,B002DC8GIG,L. Becker,"I've been using DDR as part of my exercise routine for over a year, so when Hottest Party 3 came out, I just had to buy it! I was excited to have 50 new songs and curious about the inclusion of the Wii balance board. So, how does it rate?

Tournament Mode: There's no more maneuvering maps as in HP1 and HP2. HP3 moves you through automatically. It also has 2 different tournaments, one for basic players and one called ""Challenge"" which requires you to beat songs at the Difficult level or higher. I played the basic one first and unlocked a number of songs, outfits, stages, etc. Then I played on ""Challenge"" and unlocked totally different things, including additional songs. Tournament mode is feet-only- no hand motions. The tournament itself is rather short. You can probably beat the entire thing in about an hour if you really know how to play DDR. But you won't unlock everything by playing tournament mode. For HP3, you unlock more items simply by playing. After every song, you will accumulate DDR Points. After you reach a certain amount of DDR points, you will unlock something. I haven't figured out exactly how many points you need to unlock the next thing. DDR points are kind of random and confusing, but an interesting concept nonetheless.

Hypermove Mode: For HP3, using the wiimote/nunchuck along with the dance pad is a mode, not an option to turn on and off. If you liked the inclusion of hand-motions, you'll probably be playing this mode a lot. The hand-motions have changed a bit since HP1 and HP2. There's a new ""flicking"" motion that doesn't really register very well. This is obviously a kink that will hopefully be worked out in HP4.

Wii Balanceboard Mode: I'd call this ""lazy mode."" Don't pick up your feet, just lean. It's kind of like Wii Fit's skiing/snowboarding activities. You lean forward, backward, left and right as the arrows appear on the screen. It will also have you doing hulahooping moves. There's only two difficulty levels - Beginner and Basic. Balanceboard Mode also has you doing handmotions, which doesn't always register with the game. Perhaps it's useful as a cooldown or if you just want to listen to the HP3 soundtrack without getting all sweaty. Oh yeah, and not every song you unlock is available for Balanceboard Mode. So, you might be out of luck on some of your favorite songs.

Workout Mode: I spend a lot of time in this mode. A *GREAT* addition to HP3 is that it tracks your calorie burn and weight loss. When you first enter into Workout Mode, the game will ask you if you want to use the Wii Balanceboard to record your weight! FABULOUS! After you weigh yourself using the balanceboard, you can see your BMI, ideal weight, and a chart that tracks your progression. I love this feature and those of you who use DDR to lose weight will definitely appreciate this as well. Workout mode has 3 sub-modes - you can do feet-only, hypermove (feet and hands), and even balanceboard mode. It's the same as HP1 and HP2, though, in that you can set your goal (time, calories, free play) and choose your songs or courses you've unlocked.

DDR School: This mode requires a brief discussion. Unlike HP1 and HP2 where you were pretty much on your own on learning how to play the game, DDR School breaks down the game piece by piece. It has a number of lessons, including the VERY BASIC step left, step right....but it also contains lessons about hand movements, using the balanceboard, AND gimmicks. My gripes with the lessons are that 1) it's the same song for a good 16 out of 18 lessons; 2) the gimmicks lessons are useless as the gimmick arrows are NOT mixed in with regular arrows, so they don't really prepare you for playing with gimmicks; and 3) There is no lesson on hitting ""cut notes""...those annoying 1/8 to 1/32 beat notes. I've been DYING to figure those out since HP1. I've tried playing songs with those notes, but they barely appear on the BASIC level and on DIFFICULT level, it's too hard to practice. Perhaps I should invest some time in Training mode.

Soundtrack: Konami has interesting music taste. It has an intriguing mix of music from the 80s, 90s, and today. For example, you've got Lady Gaga's ""Just Dance"" and then Vanilla Ice's ""Ice Ice Baby."" Many songs have the actual music video, which is awesome! I've also really fallen in love with some of Konami's original music, particular the song ""Celebrate Night."" FUN!! The downside to the soundtrack is that there are very few songs in the 120-150 BMP range. Songs that you'd think should be fast-paced are not and it's kind of disappointing when you really want to just rock out!

Miscellaneous comments: I didn't address Free Play mode, but it's the same has HP1 and HP2. As always, I praise DDR for having a number of options to increase or decrease the difficulty of play. You can change arrow speed, turn on/off jumps, cut notes, gimmicks, and of course...simply change the difficulty! The game has a great deal of re-playability as long as you don't get sick of hearing the same songs over and over.

If you're new to DDR, buy Hottest Party 3 first. If you're buying this for your kids, I wouldn't worry too much about song lyrics or videos included in this game. You might be hesitant to have a child under 10 watch the Pussycat Dolls ""When I Grow Up"" video or the ""Bonafide Lovin'"" video that plays in the background. But for the most part, the game is absolutely appropriate for kids 12+. And with the ability to change how hard the game is, any level of player can understand and be successful at playing DDR.

I can't wait for the next DDR!!! But in the meantime, I'll be playing Hottest Party 3. It's a fun game and a great way to lose a few pounds!",An Interesting Addition to the Hottest Party series,1268352000,9,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

5.0,False,"09 23, 2012",A2OI6T3Y2RFJ14,B000R37S78,A to the K,"Based on the other reviews I wanted to completely finish this game before throwing out my two cents. I just finished it today so here it goes.

For veterans of the SRPG genre this probably won't offer any significant challenge. However that shouldn't be a deal breaker. This game brought a lot of other elements to the table that were quite fun and engaging to play through. That being said it's a great game for beginners or casual players of SRPGS.

Be prepared to read. If you just want to dive in and blow up your screen that won't be happening here. In between every battle there are cut scenes and dialogue bits that can be time consuming. I personally enjoyed it because it proved that the storytelling aspect was just as important as gameplay. While the story itself wasn't anything ground breaking it was certainly creative, solid and engaging. Cut scenes were nicely animated and voice acting was pretty spot on. The overall art direction may seem bright and fluffy but there are more than a few surprisingly morbid/disturbing points as the plot unfolds. Sound is OK- after a while you might want to go into options and turn the music down and leave the EFX vol. up.

As you progress through the game new characters join your party. The characters are individually bound to a kind of weapons proficiency: sword, battle axe, dagger, bow, staff, whip, and lance. In most battles you can play anywhere from 5 to 7 characters. This gives you a wide range to play around with strategically. Along with weapons proficiency you also collect skill stones which you can later on ""bind"" to create more powerful stones. These stones come in 4 different flavors: Offensive abilities that use MP and are connected to each characters' weapon proficiency, Passive skills (often buffs or counters), Magic abilities (which any character can use keeping in mind that some of these skills use a lot of MP), and finally inherent passive skills which are again bound to a characters' weapon proficiency that often add a boost of some kind when equipped. Ultimately each character will be allowed to equip up to 6 skill stones and after you've collected or created a good chunk of these stones you have a surprisingly large palette for customizing each character every round before battle.

Along with skill stones is a feature that implements ""spirit affinity""- sol, luna, and stella. It seems a little complicated at first and certainly isn't crucial to pay much attention to until further into the game. It essentially works, as many people have said, as a sort of ""rock, paper, scissors"" dynamic wherein each affinity has a strength and weakness to a corresponding affinity (luna is stronger over sol but weak against stella). The game provides tutorials on how to use this to your advantage in battle. Each affinity will come in the form of a skill stone (passive) that you can equip in any combination onto each character based on the enemies' affinities with the objective of making your party just a little bit stronger in both offense and defense. Anyhow, it's an interesting concept that misses the mark just a little bit for me but nonetheless can be a huge factor in whether or not your battles last a long time or are over more quickly.

On the topic of battle length, YES there is a round limit implementation. If you play smart and don't screw around this will never be an issue. From start to finish I never once had to replay a battle because I exceeded the round limit. Some people have complained that this is a cock block to grinding characters or whatever- as the game progresses it will offer ""Free Combat"" areas on the map which although still have a round limit are excellent opportunities to grind your heart out or play with group and skill combinations. I personally will spend a lot of time doing this and I think it took some of the challenge out of the game in later levels because I turned a lot of my group into absolute beasts. Also there are skill stones that will give a character extra EXP points if you find you have some folks lagging behind. Anyhow, it's up to you, just sayin' the option is there.

Oh and the armlets. The storyline will explain how these came to be, why they exist and how to use them. They are essentially worn by only a few and, when ""charged"" (similar to MP) can be used during a battle for a few rounds to sortof hulk out a character. While it was an important element for the storyline, the actual feature may have been overkill with the skill stones and spirit affinities- sometimes it makes things altogether too easy. I didn't use these very much and the game would have no doubt been a lot more challenging without the option.

Despite there being a fairly large party of players at your disposal there were only one or two I didn't feel some kind of connection to. Throughout battles and cut scenes and everything everyone seems to have something to say or some little dialogue bubble that pops up that gives you a sense of who they are. One person is a little whiny and meek (while still being a badass), one is cocky and flirtatious, one is a meat head, etc... I thought this was pretty impressive considering some games just completely ignore these peripheral characters that are there the entire time.

Alright so in a nutshell-
PROS:
- The story probably won't really blow your hair back but it's solid and unassuming. And if you have trouble delineating between the factual history of St. Joan and a fantasy interpretation involving beasts, demons and dark elves then I'm not really sure what to say to you.
- Despite it straying a bit from traditional skill leveling and character customization, JoA gives you plenty to play around with in a unique (but not earth shattering) format as well as a variety of characters.
- In terms of handheld titles, this is an easy one to pick up and play for short bits of time here and there. You have the option of both a hard save in between battles and quicksave during battles.
- It's like ocular candy in both presentation and animated cut scenes.
- Overall difficulty level is perfect for beginners of SRPGS and would probably be considered a ""light read"" for veterans.
- At this point JoA costs, what, like $5 ?

CONS:
- Some of the gameplay elements are creative but fall a little short in providing more balance to strategy
- Music can become a little repetitive
- Final boss battle felt more like a wet fart than a final battle.

First let me try to explain why i think this is a good game. I think the first thing i noticed when i popped the disc in and loaded it up was the Graphics. They are truly representative of the ps4 potential. The graphics are top notch. The cars all look beautiful, the weather, the sun and lighting effects are all realistic. You can change the time of day in most races and if u happen to be driving while the sun is setting... Well you're gona have a bad time because the sun will be blinding. But at the same time thats pretty darn impressive.

Another thing this game has going for it is the simplified/stripped down approach to racing. No silly story here. In fact right after the loading screen, you are put behind the wheel of a Mercedez Bens AMG. Not even a tutorial if i remember correctly. But thats what i like! Thats what i expect from a racing simulator. No silly story that doesnt make sense. No annoying anouncer telling you to slow down on your turns. Nothing. Heck not even a soundtrack unless you change the default settings and turn the voulume up from its original 0% it's meant to be all driving and focus on the sounds of the cars.

Ah yes the cars.. This topic is somewhat difficult.  Yes we already established that they look good, they sound good... But do they handle? Well see here's where driveclub can become an issue if you don't know what it's trying to acomplish. This game is a pure racing simulator. No forgivness. No rewind no nothing. So yeah the cars will perform as they're supposed to. Dont expect a Hyper car to handle all fine and dandy when your going 180+ mph. They all have a unique handling.and especially so depending on the weather condition. If its raining and you're in that rwd car haulling ass... Forget it. You're toast. All the cars required me to do a practice run and then go for the real race.... And i would still come out 5th place. This also has to do with the AI which is yet another thing that grinds my gears when playing this game. Just picture them as beyond professional. They are not intimidated by you and they follow a perfect line all through the track. Im serious this game will require multiple runs through an event. But yet it is still fun. Because it's really satisfying to fail a couple of times and then finally get in the zone and come out on top. Truly satisfying.

Just be prepared. This is no need for speed.

Ah yes now is everything all worth the pricetag? Well.. I would say it depends. I spent about 25 bucks. Amazon at the time that i am writing this is out of stock but that doesnt mean you cant price match it at a store! Thats what i did. I showed em the 25 dollar price. And they matched amazon. However apart from That i spent another 25 for the season pass which is the cheapest method to obtain ALL the dlc and extra cars. Without the dlc you miss out on a ton of stuff. So if u plan on playing this without the dlc then i would say its not worth it. You will be missing out on a lot.
But for 50 bucks total spent. Im really enjoying this game.

So here's a basic good/bad summary of the game

GOOD: Visuals, Sound, weather effect, simplified racing approach, cars are demanding yet rewarding to drive

Bad: AI will have you beat often. No ability to change AI Dificulty, incomplete roster of cars/events if you don't purchase season pass DLC. Does this game require patience? Yes.",Love/hate relationship,1440979200,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

5.0,False,"10 2, 2007",ABNI7Z61A82R4,B000TGB4QO,R. Morris,"NBA 2K7 was arguably the greatest basketball game ever created.  The gameplay was simply no match for NBA Live's gameplay, which was downright horrible.  Well, just when I though 2K Sports couldn't make a better basketball game than last years, this game came out.  One of the big problems with NBA 2K7 was the graphics.  A lot of the players didn't really resemble their real life counterpart.  Well, that is no longer the case.  2K8's graphics are the best I've seen yet, and all the players look so realistic that you actually believe that you're out there with them sweating on the court.

Of course, graphics aren't everything, right?  Well, 2K8 has even better gameplay than last years.  The shot stick still rocks the house, but there are also a lot of new additions to each game you play.  After each game, you can watch the top three plays of the game.  But that's not the coolest part.  After each game, you can watch a highlight real of any player during the game.  If you're playing as Kobe Bryant and you score 50 points against your opponent, then after the game you can watch each amazing play made by Kobe during the game.  Sweet, right?

Well, this game also has a very fun and very realistic Sprite Slam Dunk Contest.  This should keep you busy for hours, and it isn't even a part of the main game. If you're not good a dunking, there is a dunk school that can teach you how to emulate LeBron on his jams.  There is also a really cool 3-Point Shootout.

So, if you're debating whether or not you should go with the hoops king 2K8, or try NBA Live 08, then I would HIGHLY suggest you get 2K8.  Even though Live 08 is greatly improved upon, it still has a ways to go to catch up with 2K Sports and their basketball genius.",NBA 2K8 Takes It Up A Notch!,1191283200,21,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Get it while you can because the new PS3 models requires you to have an HDMI cable and of course, an HDTV to watch HD content (not video games) such as blu-ray films. If you already have an HDTV then you don't have much of a problem but this model right here still let you watch blu-ray films without the HDMI cable, just the composite cable that comes inside the box. Also, 320 GB is not bad at all and you can always upgrade for more memory. If you're not looking for much into getting a lot of content then this is good for everyone. Otherwise, it's good to start off with this console since it packs with some good things. This bundle comes with PS Move motion controller, PS3 webcam, and a copy of Sports Champions. I recommend buying an extra PS Move motion controller to fully experience the Sports Champions game. If you like, you can get the PS Move navigation controller but it really is optional unless you're planning to play games like Playstation Move Heroes.

3.0,False,"09 15, 2008",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000X25GWW,Lisa Shea,"My Weight Loss Coach DS is an awesome idea. It comes with a free pedometer, that you can plug into your DS! It lets you track your steps each day easily. The rest of the 'game', though, is a mixed blessing.

The game is broken out into a number of areas. Each day you plug in your pedometer so it knows right away how many steps you took wearing it. I already own a pedometer which plugs into a computer, and I have to say my other one is much better. This one just counts total steps. The other one actually tracks them by hour and by intensity - so you get an instant graph of how active you were each hour, which were quiet steps, which were energetic steps and so on. It's much more helpful.

You can input other activities you've done, but it's a very kludgy interface. You choose an icon of what type of general thing you did - housework, team sports etc - and then manually spin a clock dial to point at an interval. It won't even let you check the box if it's under an hour worth of effort.

Then there are challenges - both food and activity related, both short term (""do now"") and longer term (""do by tomorrow""). Sometimes the items are easy - hide the salt, clean out the fridge. Sometimes they are more complicated, like go out jogging. However, sometimes they are just non-doable for some people. Go jogging and don't come home until you spot an animal? Go bake some bread from scratch? Organize a team sport and get your family and friends to play? I can easily see some gamers getting frustrated by these types of challenges because they simply don't have the supplies or ability to do them in their environment.

The DS will say something like ""do 20 lunges"" but give you no idea how to do them. You have to go find your manual and look it up. With other activity DS games I have, they explain the activity to you and have animated demonstrations.

Even some of their ""coaching tests"" seem not quite kosher. They rate you down if you drive a car to the corner store rather than walking. Some of us don't have ""corner stores"" within safe walking distance.

For daily food tracking, they don't use calories or carbs or other normal units. They use ""energy units"" which means the things you're learning will be completely unhelpful in the real world. Also, the interface is again extremely tedious. Let's say you ate a serving of turkey. You have to go paging through the general food types, find the poultry area and drag down a poultry item. It then separates into different types of poultry - turkey, chicken and breaded chicken. You drag one of the turkey items onto the person. You have to do that with every single food you eat, all day long.

I definitely appreciate what it is trying to do, and I imagine most people would find it cute for a week or two, but I really don't see most users going through that tedious interface for more than that.

Finally, the game is very much set up for completely sedentary people. Its idea of activity is to stand and sit 10 times. If you are not in the ""obese"" range, I am not sure their activities are really going to help you become more healthy. Even for obese people, I think there are many other better options out there to help you improve your health.

Still, if you really love your DS and don't own a pedometer, this isn't a *bad* choice. I am all for people using whatever works for them. If you don't mind this interface and enjoy the little challenges, then have at it! Being active this way is far better than being inactive.

5.0,True,"09 28, 2011",A26TJ6XR2RYF9S,B004Z4ZKL6,Intellix,"Fifa 12 has excelled in leaps and bounds from Fifa 11. This is the game with the most authentic gameplay that literarily puts you in the shoes of the footballers. The one area that the game has improved on is the overall gameplay. There is no longer the hustling and jostling in the penalty box as in Fifa 11 where seems like all players were attaracted to the ball on your feet like a magnet making the game more like a rugby match. The movement, twists and turns of the players are fluid and with the proper use of the left axis you can leave defenders biting dust. The overall player AI has improved vastly and the goal keepers seem to be better as well. (Atleast mine was as Peter Cech made lots of stunning saves).
The player impact technology makes the game a whole lot of fun with collisions resulting in different results every time.

Next comes the hard part. This year EA has introduced something named Tactical Defending. This was to ensure that the game is as close to real life football as possible. Moving away from the legacy defending (which you can turn ON in the game if you wish), the defensive work is no longer about going to the feet of the player and pressing the X button to make a tackle and get the ball. It usually resulted in a lot of breaks in the fluid gameplay. You need to be careful this time with defending. With Tactical defending, you will need to jockey around the player with the ball waiting for the perfect moment to make a tackle. If you don't tackle at the right moment the player will outfox you leaving your defender biting dust. Only after jockeying around (That is the term EA has used for using the defender to tactically cover the ball preventing the player from making a move), you will make a tackle at the right moment when you think you can win over the ball. The sliding tackles look more realistic. A good tackle will result in excellent defensive work while more often than not, a bad tackle will let you have a straight red card. The tactical defending will take some time to master so its recommended that you practice a lot and don't give up. (Being an intermediate player I have had a lot of trouble and seems like every time the opposition attacked me, they just ripped open my defense. Hmmmmmm........I need to practice more).

The visuals haven't changed a lot so people may not notice much difference in the graphics from Fifa 11. But EA has added a lot of new player animations.

Last but not the least: Andy Gray is no longer in the commentary team. Its Martin Tyler and Allan Smith this time.

Pros:
1) Fluid and more authentic gameplay
2) EA Sports Football Club (Makes your every achievement count as experience points which would go as a support to the actual real world club you support. There are leagues to determine which is the top club every week and who gets relegated. Pretty Cool.)
3) Improved AI.
4) Tactical defending ensures that players are equally engrossed when involved in defensive battles since a mistake can cost them the match.

Cons:
1) No improvement in overall graphics.
2) Tactical defending takes some time to master. I have already seen few forums with people complaining about it and switching back to legacy defending. However, legacy defending cannot be used in Online modes. So my advice is to practice and master this new aspect.

In fact, when I was deciding between an Xbox of PS4, ARB was the reason I choose this system.

So I really, really wanted to love this game; but I don't... I just don't

The graphics are beautiful, the world seems interesting and the players are very friendly... but the developers dropped the ball on one key feature that should be in ALL video games: THEY SHOULD BE FUN!

This is arguably one of the most boring games I've ever played. The game opens with a really cool cut scene, but proceeds into a very uninteresting opening segment that drags on and on and on and on. Just like with any book or movie, you have to capture your audience right from the start. I was warned about this, so I continued to play but things just didn't improve. I am level 17, and so far each quest has been boring and pointless fetch quests that add absolutely no element of adventure or fantasy to the game.

To top it off, I really hate the map system. You would think that an MMORPG would have decided a very interesting and detailed map that the player can look at to get a sense of the worlds scale to encourage exploration, but the maps in this game are just frustrating and non-intuitive. After, around 15-20 hrs of game play, they are still confusing and I finally had enough.

So, I quit playing. I like games, but I love my real world hobbies more. So, a game that isn't interesting or fun to play simply is not worth my time. If you are interested in this game, give it a try because 25$ for the game and a months free trail ain't bad. If you are like me, it won't take long for you to realize this game isn't worth your time.

This game is the very definition of a niche title, aiming itself squarely at older gamers who remember grid-based dungeon crawlers in the old days when you had next to no information about various elements of the in-game world and two hours of work could be undone by an unlucky run in with a particularly nasty skeleton. This isn't so much a tribute to those games as an elaborate recreation of them, and all the flaws that came with RPGs from that era.

Old dungeon-crawlers (think Wizardry or The Bard's Tale) were essentially frustrating grind-fests that killed you frequently and never stopped to explain themselves. Generally, you learned through trial-and-error as you went along and suffered long hours of tedious and monotonous gameplay in order to perhaps graduate to the second level of the dungeon after hours and hours of sheer work. Most never included a map function, forcing players to create their own maps on graph paper, and the various items/weapons were largely mysterious in nature until you bought them and discovered what they were good for.
The Dark Spire accomplishes this with ease and grace, even managing to throw in random stat selection ala D&D.

The game has two modes: Standard and Classic. Standard mode drapes the game in dark textures and designs of astonishing power, giving the game a haunting and gothic edge. There is some variation in the music, but it is generally unexceptionable.
For gamers eager for the most retro experience possible, the Classic mode is available. This mode literally discards all of the textures and designs in the game, replacing shadow strewn walls with wireframes. Literally. That's it. This mode recreates the PC RPG look and feel of games such as Wizardry and Akalabeth as authentically as I have ever seen.
Unless you're one of the 'Hardcore Players,' who don't need to even think about reading reviews of this before purchase, you're not likely to keep the game on Classic Mode for more than a few minutes, in which time your curiosity will likely be satiated.

I am giving this game four stars for doing what it has set out to do. In all fairness, I cannot award it a 5, as it is so faithful in its recreation of ancient PC RPGs that it also includes all of the same problems. The game is long, frustrating, infuriating, often baffling, and never fair to the player at all. Which won't be an issue for most of the people likely to be playing this game.

If you have no idea of what I am talking about, but are curious about this game, please take this simple test: find an old Commodore 64 or similarly archaic computer and play a dungeon crawler on it. If you like it, you probably really, really like it, and will probably already be sketching maps for the various levels of the dungeon. If you're in this group of people, purchase this immediately. However, if you grow sick of the monotonous frustration of the process early on, and find yourself yearning for the relative user-friendliness of a Final Fantasy game, then don't even consider getting this.

The well designed maps, vehicles, and weapons kits made it a game that was more than your run of the mill run-around-like-an-idiot-deathmatch first person shooter.  Battlefield:  Bad Company takes that one step further.

Kits:
Each weapons kit suits a different style of play.  They all also play a vital role on each map.  With games like CoD4, the kits don't really serve as much of a function as the gameplay is still your standard deathmatch type.  (I tried the other gameplay, but the learning curve is steep.  In my experience, only ""l33t"" gamers venture outside of the team deathmatch servers.)  With the added feature of the destructibility of the BF: BC maps, the kit selection is even more important.  You can create your own paths to the gold crates and eliminate your enemy's opportunity for cover.

Vehicles:
This is one area that sets BF: BC apart from its competitors.  The addition of vehicles ads an element of strategy to the gameplay simply not present in CoD4.  There are many vehicle types in this game:  tanks, armored transport vehicles, artillery pieces, and helicopters.  Each provides a team, attack or defense, with a respectable force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.  Unless you know how to respond to each threat, your team will be overwhelmed.  Conversely, if you are operating one of these vehicles and do not know how to respond to enemy countermeasures, you will find yourself jumping into tanks simply to die before you make it to the enemy's base.

Maps:
For the most part, they are small.  They are small maps designed to create small, fast, urban warfare environments.  Even the maps that have a lot of space, combat is bottlenecked into villages where the crates are contained.  As an attacker or defender, the maps provide predictable locations for the majority of the combat.  The addition of destructible environments allows for some deviation and an element of the unpredictable.

Negative aspects:
The only negative that I've experienced are lag issues with the servers.  Twice I've had >450 scores with some time left in the game just to have the server lock up on me and force me to restart my PS3.  After those two occasions, though, I've been able to identify that I'm on a server with lag issues and log out for another one before having the system lock up on me.  If you're on one map and having lag issues, Ascension for example, just leave that game and select a game on Over and Out.  Usually it takes just one switch for me to find a server that is free of lag.

Voice chat is a concern.  I've frequently found myself on teams filled with new players making juvenile mistakes.  All it would take to fix those mistakes is the ability to communicate with my teammates.  Sadly, I don't have a bluetooth headset and don't plan on buying one.  Even those with the headsets have complaints that they are unable to communicate.

Overall:
I'd say that this game is far better than the competitors currently found in the genre.  For the PS3 everything else is centered around typical deathmatch play.  Battlefield provides a more realistic first person shooter experience, and that in my opinion makes it more fun.",Who buys Battlefield for single player?,1218153600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

BF3 offers more cooperative gameplay than MW3.

Roosto,"Well, I have to say, after twelve years, Beach Head 2000 still remains a classic in my biggest collection of video games on the best system: the PC. Sure, it isn't as enthralling as it was all those years ago when I didn't care about how bad the graphics were, or the repetition, but I can still jump into a game off my last save and still test my skills at shooting moving objects from a stationary position, while having a good deal of fun.

  I feel that Beach Head 2000 is a very underrated video game in the video gaming community, and therefore, it deserves credit where credit is due. The repetition of the game and the similar paths an enemy takes in each round does get boring, but if you look past that, there is skill needed to stick with it and progress through the levels. Even though one can memorize these paths, dealing with several enemies at once can get challenging, and that's what the game has going for it. So, if you like shooting enemies constantly and blowing them up with missiles and AT cannon fire, then you'll like this one.

  Don't expect this game to stand up against the big-name FPSs of today like Call of Duty: Black Ops or Halo, but if you're still into classic games on the PC like myself, and you want to test your skill and patience, give this one a try and see how many levels you can advance before you use a trainer(or not, because you have lots of skill).",Beach Head 2000 Review,1307923200,,,

First, the basic concept. You are Wario, a bored couch potato. Suddenly you learn about a super-thief and want to be like him. In no time at all you've stolen the thief's secret wand and have begun thieving. The wand lets you instantly don any disguise, as long as you draw the correct symbol with your stylus. Each disguise gives you different abilities - firing a laser, leaping high, etc.

This is problem number one. For some reason, the game just doesn't understand what you're drawing half the time. So you're in the middle of an intricate sequence of movements, and need to switch disguises, and the game simply refuses to understand what you're asking for. If you know what the disguise sequence is to solve the puzzle, the challenge shouldn't be making that circle or check or whatever exactly right so the wand does what you want it to do.

Next, as you go left and right on your little side scrolling screen, sometimes there are places that it seems you should be able to go to - but the game won't let you. Then there are other places that look impossible to get to - but you're allowed to go there. It adds a bit of frustration as you randomly try directions until you find one that works.

I do really like the mini-games in the chest, and how they can challenge you. Some of them are a bit on the gross side - guide the poop pile so it lands in the toilet? I mean, Wario games in the past had a ""stick the finger in the nose"" puzzle - but handling poop is a whole 'nother level of disgusting.

To go with this, I found some of Wario's incessant (and unskippable) dialogue to be over the line obnoxious. I know Wario is a bad guy and I don't mind at all ""playing as him"" in some of the other games. But in this one, I really just didn't like being him. I didn't like having to sit through the long cut scenes. I play games to relax and have fun - and the cut scenes were the opposite of fun.

I really appreciate the idea behind this game, and think it's a great setup in general. If a new version came out with the same basic idea but with many tweaks in the stylus recognition and the cut-scene area, I would really love it.

But the Skylanders set him on FIRE.

The graphics are decent for this kind of game, the gameplay is simple but fun, and the characters are varied enough to give enjoyment for various kinds of fights.  And being able to change from one character to another simply by taking off one statue and putting another on the portal was something he thought was just the coolest thing on the planet.

There's enough levels that he can sense the progression, both in the levels themselves and in leveling his characters, but they're  not so long that he gets bored before he hits the end of them.  There's the various puzzles that he just LOVES doing for unlocking things.

Controls are easy for people of any age and there's no shortage of characters to get - and fortunately lately they've been on sale at brick and mortars with buy one get one free deals, so we stocked up on a bunch.

With the addition of the Giants pack for another whole round of gaming that these characters all work in as well, not to mention the new mobile bluetooth portal of power and the game on mobile devices, there's no end to where or how to play.

It's certainly unique among a plethora of games out there, and I find myself enjoying it nearly as much as he does, and I'm someone who started gaming with the original Pong and normally dislikes third person shooters like this (I'm an Elder Scrolls or Halo kind of gamer).

I was extremely impressed with the level of detail in this simulation.  The smooth scrolling of the terrain make low level flight a definite experience.  The only drawback is that the AI is  severly lacking in creativity.  The freindly aircraft will come to your  assistance but are dependent on your commands to make any intelligent  decission when it come to target engagement.  The enemy aircraft follow  standard offensive and defensive tactics which is okay for the gamer and  simulator buff, but those craving realism require an AI that will adjust to  your moves and counter accordingly.  The shortcomings just noted are  minimal in comparison to the visual effects, audio and overall gameplay.  Nothing can be done to reduce the 5 star rating because this sim deserves  more than that.

3.0,False,"10 12, 2010",A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0034JKYOG,Tim Janson,"One of the great things about videogames today is the incredible depth, detail and complexity that they feature.  Some games are so open-ended that you can go anywhere and do almost anything.  But on the flipside, there's something to be said for not having to spend an hour reading an instruction manual or spending the first few hours of a game in a tutorial mode, learning the game's controls and features.  Sometimes you just want to plug in and start blasting away and that's where a game like Attack of the Movies 3-D from Majesco comes in.  This game shies away from complexity the way the Chicago Cubs shy away from winning baseball games.

Attack of the Movies 3-D is a fond throwback to arcade games like Area 51 and House of the Dead.  It's a first person shooter where you go along for the ride as the camera whisks you along through various environments.  The only thing you need to do is blast away at the enemies.  It can't get simpler than that!  The game's six levels are comprised of takes on various well-known films.  Level one is an attack by giant insects, harkening back to the days of sci-fi films like ""Them!""  There's an Indiana Jones style level that takes you through an Aztec-style temple; a Terminator-style level where you battle various robots and robotic weapons; and a haunted house level where you face off against hordes of skeletons, mummies, and bats.  Each level concludes with a boss battle.

The game is playable in either standard 2-D or 3-D modes.  For 3-D it comes with four pairs of those old red and blue tinted glasses but as is the case of 3-D movies of this type, the effects are mixed at best.  Add to that the fact that wearing those glasses for long will almost guarantee a migraine and you're best served by going with the 2-D version.  The game can be played with one to four players cooperatively however, in a shortsighted development blunder, all the players share the same health bar so when one's dead, you're all dead.  I suppose this is to make up for the relative ease of the game.  Playing on the Easy difficulty setting the first time around, I was able to finish all six levels in about an hour.  Obviously replay value is almost nonexistent.

In each level you'll blast not only monsters but also various power-ups that increase the fire rate of your weapon, score multipliers, as well as health icons and 1-ups.  Even though your weapons may change (slightly) in each level, they are essentially the same in that there are single fire, 3 burst fire, and fully automatic rapid-fire, whether you're using a regular weapon or a futuristic laser gun.  You can use your Wii zapper if you have one but it's not necessary.

While the six levels all offer a diversity of enemies and designs they are fundamentally the same.  The player has no control over where to go.  The only actions you'll take are firing your fun and then shaking the Wii controller to reload.  Simple yes, but a bit too simple for hardcore gamers.  Attack of the Movies 3-D is a nice diversion for kids or for older players looking for a retro-arcade experience but ultimately it fails to engage for any length of time.

It tries to go the Forrest Gump slash Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon route by taking some actual historical events, and film clips, and blending them with their story. Basically it comes off as Red Dawn with Korea instead of Russia, and instead of Patrick Swayze, we get a pilot. All that aside, it is a very linear shooter that attempts to identify itself with a few unique things, such as being able to talk to people in almost RPG like town settings. It would have been nice if they expanded on that, by offering shops, or more meaningful content in those type of settings (Fallout?), but like much of the game it just feels rushed, and mediocre. Another fine example of this is the newspapers you pick up as you go along, they tell part of the story, but look to be little more than text on a page. Being a newspaper, shouldn't it have looked like a newspaper, and not a book report?

It just really seems like the game was pulled in two directions with the type of content they have. One side was pulling to make it a fast paced action game where you go go go, shoot shoot shoot, and go go go again, whereas the other side wanted it more go go, shoot shoot, stop and take in what is going on, absorb the world and those ""surviving"" in it. What comes out the other end is a semi-meaningless linear trek through their story, with a few somewhat fun gimmicks to keep you amused along the way.

As a fan of first persons shooters, it is always nice to shoot at new things with familiar controls, so I can't call this a bad game. There are classic little things that annoy me, like for instance, at one point I stopped short of a story point, and this one guy kept spawning, running to a fence, hopping over it, and then shooting at me. I just stood there shooting him over and over and over, until I took a few more steps forward, and he stopped spawning.

This game is nothing but online battles with/against vulgar 12-year-olds and ber elitists who take the game way too seriously.  There is no single-player story or campaign mode.  There are no real space battlesthey took the star out of Star Wars.  Its nothing but a lackluster first-person shooter (or a rail shooter for the speeder bikes, which actually aren't too bad).

Sound:
The music doesnt particularly stand out (nor should it), but they did a great job of recording Star Wars music.  I have (and am familiar with) all the film soundtracks, and I appreciate the verisimilitude.  The voice acting is terrible, however.  Princess Leia sounds nothing like Princess Leia.  Nor does Vader.  There are so many great Darth Vader voice synthesizers out there, but they couldn't bother.  Just about any actorcan do a better Darth Vader impression than whomever they cast.  Admiral Ackbar doesnt sound too bad though.

Graphics:
The graphics are picturesque, which is a pity because this is a video game and not a picture.  As aesthetic as they may be, theres a limited range pop-up, which makes shooting flying vehicles from the ground improbable.  The markers block your view and are often off-target.  But they did a really good job of making beautiful, screen-accurate locales.

Controls:
The controls are nice and responsive, but the default control scheme is limited and backwards.  Youd expect a version (or at least a variant) of the Star Wars Battlefront II controls, but nope.  They have a few setting to swap buttons, but there aren't many options.  Theres no ability to roll the X-wing, which is integral to any flight simulator.  Its basically a flying snowmobile that gets stuck upside-down a lot.  The Jedi are the same as in Battlefront II, only the Jedi are slower and need to recharge for ten seconds after using the Force, because, you know, that makes sense.

Fun Factor:
This game is an online FPS and nothing more.  Anything the game offers is better found in Call of Duty or Battlefield, whichever camp you find yourself in.  You can try to play it sheerly for the Star Wars brand, but the game will ruin itself for you quickly.  What an incredible disappointment.  We were all hoping for an updated/rebooted Battlefront II after ten years, but EA admitted that a real (non-cloned) game isn't worth its time.

I say this as someone who is not typically interested in multiplayer shooters, but who used to enjoy team shooters. It kind of makes sense that I like Overwatch because it feels like the ultimate class-based team shooter.

Let me list the things I love about Overwatch: It has fun and varied and attractive characters, multiple different game modes, gorgeous and well-designed zones, brilliant and rewarding post-game stats displays, built-in highlights, non-offensive microtransactions solely for cosmetic items, and so on.

Overwatch is a master class in videogame design. Here are some examples:

Enemy characters have louder footsteps, and their footsteps are distinctivethe samurai Hanzo is light on his fight while D.Va in her walking mech sounds like shes clomping around in a robotic exoskeleton.

Character silhouettes are so distinct that you can identify which character is around the corner based on the shadow it is throwing on a wall down the hall.

The post-game screens are brilliant and feel rewarding regardless of your personal skill level. It is much more than just a leaderboard, recognizing you for performing well with stats that make sense for the particular character(s) you used that game.

A few technical problems on console do arise, and there are some imbalanced characters on particular maps and modes, but I have faith that Blizzard will fix these issues over time because they have legendary support of their games.

I love this game, its so complex and is very interesting. I used to hate RPG's. Final Fantasy was utter crap, and gave a bad name to the genre, but TOS is great to say the least.

  STORY: 10/10

The story is very original. You are Lloyd Irving and your friend Collette, who is the chosen, recieves an oracle. This is the start of the story, it becomes very complex when you get to Triet and start releasing seals.

  GAMEPLAY: 12/10

This has to be one of the best parts of TOS. For one, you can level up to as high as 100 for every party member. There is also at least 40 hours of gameplay (thats if you speed through). There is a great aray of weapons, armor, items, you can customize, there are 251 enemies, and there are over 30 bosses!

  SOUND: 10/10

I'm not into the whole game-techno music (I prefer hard rock) but the music goes very well with the atmosphere, especially once you get far in the game. The sound effects and voices are almost perfect. And its good to see that each character has its own personality, that shows that Namco isn't a lazy company.

  GRAPHICS: 10/10

Now I'm not into the whole japanime thing, but I must say these graphics are well executed and the frame rate is perfect. Gamecube is much more advanced then the N64 in terms of graphics, and in TOS that becomes painfully obvious. Its almost like its 2D, but its actually 3D, yes, its very hard to explain.

  CHALLENGE: 9/10

Beating the game is hard without going to GameFAQs or something, because the layout of the game is very complex and sometimes even the synopsis won't be able to help you. Also getting your party members to level 100 can be very boring and frustrating, so the challenge there is not to quit and move on, but to keep strengthening them.

  OVERALL: 11/10

This has to be one of my favorite games of all time, and is easily the best Gamecube game. For other good Gamecube games get Super Smash Bros. Melee, Zelda: Wind Waker, SSX Tricky/3, Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, Metroid Prime 1 & 2, Starfox, and obviously this.",$19.99? Cant beat that!,1125273600,,,

As a major Soul Calibur fan, I'm very disappointed to say that Soul Calibur 3 doesn't have quite the ""caliber"" that made its predecessors such great fighting masterpiece.

The graphics, while it's almost identical to that of Soul Calibur 2, is still beautiful and detailed, and I'm actually quite glad that this factor was kept as it is. Last thing I would want to see is Namco trying something new only to end up developing a bad game.

The sound is also actually very similar, but you guys should probably don't take my words into consideration (just my sound section) because I am one of those gamers who gets too deeply involved to even worry about sound. I still think that it's done pretty well, considering that I've heard a lot of worse in game soundtracks as well as sounds itself.

Gameplay is where many changes have been done. First of all, many of the modes seem new and different, but are badly executed for the most part as the gamespot reviewer also said. Some moves also seems to be changed as my favorite character Mitsurugi was doing some weird moves instead of the old crazy move that I used to do on the original Soul Calibur and on Soul Calibur 2, no matter how much I kept on spamming only to realize a few minutes later that the moves have been changed. This makes me more angry every time I think about how hard I tried to master Mitsurugi's moves. My other big disappointment was the change of modes and menu designs, as it was a lot harder and confusing to access to different options. Speaking of confusing, the mode Tales of Chronicles was also confusing and extremely dull for the most part. Lastly, I noticed that the game has gotten more difficult than previous games but then again, maybe I forgot to change the difficulty setting to easy. Though I remember ignoring doing so because I think I read someone's review about difficulty options not existing. That will be the first thing I'm going to check next time I play Soul Calibur 3. I guess other factors of gameplay such as responsiveness of controls, intensity of gameplay, and addictiveness of multi player mode are all still the same as before.

Value actually depends on the person. Personally, I find the new modes extremely retarded, therefore replay value goes down on my part. For someone else who likes to try new approaches might favor the inclusion of new modes. But then again, it's still very engaging to try to unlock all the features of the game and to play with friends. Sadly, I can play with friends only so often as most are PC gamers. If they added an online mode (why didn't they? PS2 is online enabled...) I think I would totally forget about the new uninspiring modes (because I love fighting random people) and therefore, give replay value a full 10/10. However, that's not the case and I'd say it would only be about 8/10 if I had to score it.

As for the tilt, being a fan of Soul Calibur series, I'd say I still like it despite the fact that there are some main features (what made Soul Calibur so great) that are missing (arcade mode and battle mission mode from original Soul Calibur) and disappointing new features that are added. I continuously play game since I bought it last month and I am still enjoying it. So I guess I'm more in favor of this game.

Finally, if I had to recommend this game to anyone, I would recommend it to only Soul Calibur fans and hardcore fighting gamers who likes variety. If you have never tried Soul Calibur, then you are better off buying used Soul Calibur 2 for $5 than paying $20 to get Soul Calibur 3. (well, I got mine for $8.99 at gamestop because it was in clearance. I don't know about other gamestop stores or gamestores. I'm just assuming that it's $20. but either way, I doubt that used SC3 is $5)

BUT...if you have extra cash, try to get a Dreamcast and get the original Soul Calibur because I'm telling you, it's the one of the best damn fighting games ever made. In the end, I'm recommending Soul Calibur 1 to all newbies to this franchise.",Guess I'll have to wait until Soul Calibur 4 for a true sequel,1216425600,,,

Im not a big ""survival horror"" game fan. Was never really into Resident Evil, Silent Hill or games of the like... you see... Im what one would call an impatient gamer. I don't like big complex puzzles... I don't like walking around looking for artifacts. I like a good, immersive story... I like to shoot stuff... I like tension... I like action.

When I saw this game on the shelf at first I kinda just blew it off. I didn't even hear of it before it was released. I then read some reviews of the game and it began to peak my interest... but laying down $60 for a game is no easy feat, especially if you're entering a genra that you don't much care for... but I decided to take the risk.

This game is absolutely amazing!!! If you took the fright factor of DOOM3, and the innovation of BIOSHOCK.... you have Dead Space. Extremely well written (however the story has been done before), well produced and immersive. Graphically superior with an incredible sound design (If you have a good sound system, I recommend turning it up) which adds to the incredible tension. This game is fast paced while throwing a few puzzles in here and there, but not too repetitive to turn off an impatient gamer as myself.

As I said earlier much of this game and its theme are borrowed and they don't pretend to be 100% original (see if you can find the reference to Dr. J. Carmack in your travels). However, they have made some gameplay innovations. Whether you are receiving an audio or video message, viewing the map or scrolling through your inventory, you never leave the games enviornment... it shows up in a small holographic screen in front of you. If your lost and need to know where to go next, you simply click a button and your suit lays a temporary path (think laser pen) for you on the floor. Your gauges (health and oxygen) are actually incorporated on the back of your suit. This innovation adds to the tension and keeps you in the story throughout the game.

Dead Space is by far the scariest, most immersive and most fun game I have played this year. I cant believe I almost past it up. In short... Dead Space is Dead On.",DEAD SPACE is DEAD ON,1224547200,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

3.0,True,"05 22, 2011",A37QUQPYFMR9Y9,B004CVWETI,Tempting Reviews,"That's not to say the game is horrible.  Rather, I expected more ""game"" than I actually received.  I was skeptical about just how fun such a game could possibly be, so I wasn't expecting a shockingly amazing experience or anything...but to put it in a sentence, Radiant Historia is a game without direction.

You start the game as a man called Stocke, an employee of the Specint (short for ""Special Intelligence"", if you didn't pick that up) group.  In a nutshell, you are assigned special missions, ranging from minor creature attacks to escorting people from place to place.  Your employer, Heiss, calls you into the office for a new assignment.  As part of this, he hands you a White Chronicle, a key item in the game's progression (though you are unaware of this at the time), and asks you to discover its secrets.

Radiant is very long in the tooth when it comes to true gameplay.  Where it shines, or at least tries to, is the telling of its story.  Ironically enough, the story is actually quite good.  Without spoiling anything, you are one of two Chronicle holders, and the Chronicle gives you the power to go back to key events along one of two timelines, altering the path of the other as you go.  It's an intriguing concept and one that is also difficult to do in video games and movies, especially since nobody really has a true grasp of the inner workings of ""time travel"".  Fortunately, in Radiant, you're not actually traveling through just time.  Actually, you're traveling through what some think to be the 4th dimension - where you are not reliving points of your own history and seeing yourself as you were, but rather that you're folding time in such a way that you are moving back and forth along a linear timeline.  The reason this makes sense is that you don't lose any of your experiences or memories when you do these leaps.  In fact, your memories are key to the reason you're doing the move, and there are times you'll be called upon to fight more dangerous creatures during a leap to the past that you know weren't there before.  But again, another Chronicle holder is dancing around time causing issues.

The best analogy I can think of: anyone who's watched Quantum Leap and remembers the Evil Leaper dual-part episode, that's basically what's going on here.

I mentioned that Radiant was at least making a solid attempt to tell a good story.  I say ""attempt"", because though the story is actually a solid one, it's not told well at all.  Part of this is not the storyteller's fault; as I mentioned, it's VERY difficult to tell a story about time travel and do it in such a way that it not only makes sense, but is perfectly logical and sensible given all that we know.  Since this is a game and not real life, some can be forgiven, but others are just blatant oversights that make you scratch your head in utter confusion.  As I mentioned, you'll start out under Heiss' command, and then reach your first key decision which creates your two timelines.  It doesn't really matter which you choose first, because no matter what you do you'll have no choice but to jump to the other timeline.  In other words, there is no ""perfect scenario"" where time leaping isn't required.  This seems funny and almost wrong; it's like you're compelled to change history to benefit you, and you can't help but feel as though the game is made artificially long with this requirement.  It's not a bad thing, but it just doesn't feel comfortable for some reason.

You'll interact with the same characters in either timeline, but differently.  You also will go to the same places, but at different times in each timeline.  Where this seems to go wrong is when you want to try and complete the storyline.  The game tracks your progress in a timeline map that you can access in-game, and there are side quests where you will be asked to do various things to help complete the story.  A lot of these are simple - deliver a letter, find an item, etc.  A lot are not.  The bulk require you to go back in time and either change something that went wrong, save someone from dying, or find someone that someone else is looking for.  In of itself this would not be a problem, but because of the way that timeline map is shown, later in the game it gets extremely difficult to track progress.  It seemed to me at times that it would have been more useful to have, instead of a left-right map, just a simple listing of events in a hierarchy with completed tasks starred or grayed out, so I could focus on what was not done without too much scrolling.  It's hard to describe without seeing it, but know that by around the middle of the game, I was frustrated trying to figure out what I needed to do next.

Also, with trying to do the side events, it's extremely tasking to know exactly where to leap back in time.  Sometimes it's obvious, like when a person is at a certain point and you can jump right to that point.  Sometimes it isn't, like when someone dies in a cave and you need to figure out how they got there and how they died in order to save them.  Many times I ended up clearing side quests without ever really knowing how I did it, and some side quests I never did complete because it was never clear how to get to the point I needed to be in.  Because there's no free travel in the game, even if you know that a certain task is in a certain city, you can't just warp to that city.  From 90% of the key points you can't even walk to the city freely.  The linearity in the game hinders your ability to truly explore all there is and there is only one way to get to everything, which I found a little unsettling.  For example, there is one sidequest where you must retrieve a sword from a person who is in a specific town.  It doesn't tell you when.  It only tells you they are in a town that you only happen to be in from one specific key event.  You will then be told that the person ""just left"" the inn, but there are no additional clues as to where they went, and you might assume you need to leap before they got to the inn, but there aren't any such key events.

I was not happy to see that the battle engine was even less redeeming.  Similar to such games as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enchanted-Arms/dp/B000FUG5WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enchanted Arms</a>, your enemy is on a 9-space grid, with some enemies occupying more than space.  Your characters are in a normal turn-based line, and you have a turn tracker such as that found in some other turn-based games.  Depending on the speed of your characters, you might even get double or even triple turns before your enemy gets a chance to take a turn.  All of the usual RPG goodness is here, replete with regular spells, attacks, and special attacks that you learn from scrolls and books.  Where this breaks down is in the general strategy.  For the most part, I was able to poison every single walking enemy except some shadow enemies near the end of the game.  Fire seemed to work even on enemies where they appeared to specialize in the element, and with the exception of the very last boss, I never once felt as though I was at risk of dying.  Battles that were a little challenging were only so due to who I was forced to use.  Marco, in particular, is good for buffing effects but a horrible fighter, whereas Aht seems to be the most well-rounded of the group, being fully equipped with attack skills, magic, healing, and the fastest on the squad to boot.

I have noticed a scary trend in average games having excellent music and this one is no different.  Certain town themes like Alistel and others stand out as having amazing musical compositions and it's clear that a lot of work went into these pieces.  Graphically the game is not horrible, probably in the mid-range of regular DS games, but it's probably not going to win any artful awards.  The box cover art makes you instantly think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Magna-Carta-2/dp/B0028A6V7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Magna Carta 2</a>, but the game itself is definitely anything but.  Sprites abound, it's also not going to win any awards in the graphics category, though I imagine this should not be a dealbreaker for anyone.

One thing to watch out for - the constant traveling through time may cause you to neglect your saving duties.  There are times when, in order to complete the timeline, you must actually ""fail"" and choose the wrong decision.  This then updates the timeline and sets you back to before you made the decision.  Mentally, you'll be tempted to skip saving as you'll feel as though you're effectively immortal, but you want to make sure you remember to save every now and then.  If you get killed, that doesn't actually count in the timeline (for some reason).

So...do I recommend it?  I do recommend trying it, especially if you were a fan of Enchanted Arms, or you like turn-based games in general.  I wouldn't call it a legend or a fantastic game, but it has its moments and is worth a shot.

The graphics are spectacular, the AI is adaptable and the action is constant. Although the plot is a little thinner than it was in the previous installments, ""Halo 3"" is the killer app of games today.

The third chapter of the trilogy keeps what worked in ""Halo 2"" and added some new features (""Ripping the plasma cannon off the turret and going Rambo on the grunts? Sure!""). There's also a new ""accessory"" slot for things like portable shields and regenerators, which are nice but take some getting used to in terms of using. They are not mandatory by any means however - my first run-through from start to finish on normal difficulty saw me never use one of them.

Grenades have changed slightly - there are two more kinds (anti-personnel shrapnel and incendiary), but as an equalizer you can now carry only two of each kind now. You can see how many of each you have at all times now, which is a bonus.

I also like how the Skulls are now in Normal and Hard difficulties in addition to Legendary, because although I'm not a Halo freak I like some of the variations the skulls let me play with.

A drawback to this game is that it's more linear when it comes to mission design - usually all you can do in rush in headlong and slug it out. I would have liked to see more sniper rifles/rocket launchers lying around - you do get chances to use them, but they are few and far in between - to give those of us who like to ""soften up"" an area first or to do some sneaking around to have some fun.

3.0,False,"12 8, 2007",AKMJJES6FE2M5,B000E0XX9Q,Andrew C.,"I waited a year before picking up this game and the expansion, Mask of the Betrayer.  Since the initial release in 2006 had technical issues and other problems, I decided to get this game only after the expansion came out and received good reviews (and supposedly fixed bugs and optimization problems).  Unfortunately, not all is well with this game, even a year after release and the new expansion pack.  It has a better single-player campaign than the first Neverwinter Nights, but is still just a cut above mediocre.  If you are looking for the next Baldur's Gate-style epic, definitely don't look here.  However, with some luck, some good player-made modules might be produced with the toolset that comes with the game.

Gameplay: Story-wise, this is a run-of-the-mill roleplaying game (RPG). Your character rises from rags to riches in search of his/her life's meaning and in search of the bad guy that needs to be vanquished.  The game is based on the 3.5 Dungeon & Dragons rules and offers a lot of customization options for race, class, skills, feats, etc.  There is an awful lot of loot to be found, bought, and custom-made.  Unlike the first game, you actually have a party to control, which is both good and bad.  The good part is that your party members have personalities and make the adventuring a bit more colorful.  The bad, well, where should I start: pathfinding issues, not-too-efficient use of spells, suddenly vanishing party members, some suicidal behavior, and so on.  You can let the AI control the party, but this works well only early on.  Toward the end of the game, you'll need to micromanage each spell and sword swing.  It's not as tedious as it sounds if you ever played classic games like Baldur's Gate.  But none of the possible 10 or so party members that you can have around come close to the hilarity of a Boo & Minsc or the seductive intrigue of a Viconia from Baldur's Gate 2.

Generally, the pieces come together fairly well in this game.  The inventory system and journal are decent, as is the interface.  The camera can be annoying largely because it never seems to face in the right direction when you enter a new area.  That is, sometimes north will be toward the right side of the screen or toward the left, forcing you to swing the camera around to match the direction of the map.  You'll get used to it, but you shouldn't have to.  A few things I really liked were the number of scripted events, the save system (none of that checkpoint stuff; you can save anywhere), and the death system (no one in your party actually dies unless everyone goes down in a fight).  But the things that I really didn't like were prominent as well, mostly involving the campaign which was about twice as long as it should have been.  There are a lot of busy-work quests in the game that add absolutely nothing to the story.  Chapter 1 (there are 3 in all) is the worst in this regard, but monotonous chores and a somewhat nonsensical narrative plague the game throughout.  There is about 60-80 hours of gameplay here if you try to do everything.  A tighter, more compelling story could have been told in half that time.

Graphics: The game looks good, but certainly not great.  With the patches and the expansion installed, I didn't notice any framerate problems on my mid-range computer, although the game sometimes did not load all of the textures in each area.  Character models, monsters, and terrain are all convincing, and spell effects look particularly good.  There are night & day cycles that make the game a bit immersive, though it is hard to get too immersed in a game that is best played from a high overhead perspective and that requires constant monkeying with the camera.

Sound: The music was great.  I wouldn't mine actually owning a few of the tracks.  The voice acting ranged from decent to good, but it was the usual RPG fare of Scottish-accented dwarves, English-accented elves, deep-throated demons, and the occasionally whiny acolyte magician (always with an American accent).  Sound effects for spells and other things were appropriate.

Technical Issue/Documentation: The game comes with a rather lengthy manual, which is quite helpful.  It also has a clever tutorial at the beginning.  Whether you get it alone or with the expansion, prepare for up to a 30-minute install which includes downloading some big patches.  The game was rock-solid stable for about the first 30 hours of gameplay.  Then the crashes started.  According to posts at the official website, people are still having a variety of problems with this game, even after all the patches.  My issues involved the game refusing to load new areas and crashing during transitions. The first time this occurred (while leaving Ammon Jerro's haven), I was able to find a workaround solution on the internet.  The second time (at Crossroad Keep in chapter 3) there was just nothing that could be found to get me around this.  I never got to finish the game. This was very frustrating and more than likely will keep me from buying another game by this developer.  In fact, I was so disgusted by this problem that I sold both the game and the expansion on eBay.  I had really had enough of the main quest after 50+ hours.

Value/Recommendation: If you like D&D-style roleplaying games, this might be worth your while at the current price ($20). However, be sure to patch it and be willing to deal with the game's remaining technical issues.  This is really not a good value unless you are going to play player-made modules and/or play online.  As with the first game, the single-player campaign, while long and with a few high points, is largely unremarkable (and buggy) and there are better RPGs available.

Then, when it's time to enjoy 'end game' content, sadly, we can't. Seems raiding, where the non-elite player is concerned, is where this games' decision makers turn a blind eye. For the life of me, I can't figure out why the decision makers won't create a raiding difficulty slider. Diablo 3 has a monster power slider. You would think Warcraft, with it's vast resources, could easily and quickly implement such a feature. What percent, as it stands now, grinds content. What I mean is, in order to enjoy the very best 'war'craft, what percentage devotes their efforts maxing the battle readiness of their characters.

From grinding materials for potions, dailies for gear, crafting for gold etc. My guess, less than 5 percent. Then why do those given the responsibility of making this game better, exclude almost all of it's players from enjoying, all of it's content. I've sent them my views on this years ago. I see forum posts now echoing my views. I was told by an in game GM they implemented such a feature in patch 5.2. Neither he nor I could locate that information. Was he mistaken, mislead, lying, I don't know.

You get a sense of an elitist bent, from those up on high. Which at times you see rear it's ugly head in the game. I guess Diablo 3, with the mass exodus of players, decided to try and keep some by creating such a difficulty slider. Whereas, Warcraft, with it's relatively stable base of subs, could care less. Patch after patch of new and improved end game content. All aimed at that top 1 percent of players. Some of us will never be top 1 percent. Doesn't, and should not mean we should be excluded from enjoying that content.

I guess 'good', is not good enough where Warcraft is concerned. Well, we did get pets, pet battles and a new Panda race to keep us busy. No need to grind content, materials for the later. Guess it will be time, again, to stop playing, to delete all maxed characters and professions. Look at some other MMO's to play for awhile. If only there was some real MMO competition.

I've been playing video games for over 25 years now. I've owned just about every console that's ever been released, and have a broad experience to judge from an objective standpoint. With that said, I am really satisfied with the Wii U. If you're an avid gamer and have chosen an allegiance to one console, I implore you to consider broadening your gaming horizons, and here's why...

Nintendo has been making video games for a long time. Most modern gamers are only familiar with Nintendo's older, retro games of the 8 and 16 bit eras, or the Wii and DS from last generation. The Wii was a popular console, and thrived off pick-up-and-play games that required little skill to master. The Wii U, however, is a return to form in many respects. In case you didn't know, you buy a Nintendo console for one reason- Nintendo's own first party games. You won't find many modern mega budget western AAA games (like Grand Theft Auto) on a Nintendo console. What you will find, however, is a mother load of excellent, high quality Nintendo exclusives that cannot be found on any other gaming device. The games make the system, and Wii U is holding them in spades.

Games like Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, New Super Mario Bros U, Pikmin 3, Wonderful 101, the almighty Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, Rayman Legends, Super Mario 3D World, Zelda Windwaker HD, Pushmo World, Lego City Undercover, Sonic Racing Transformed, Mario Kart 8, Wii Sports Club (an HD, online remake of the ever-so-popular Wii game that started it all), Sonic Lost World, Bayonetta 2, Smash Bros, Hyrule Warriors, Sonic Boom and Captain Toad are all games you will have access to if you own a Wii U. And next year is looking even better, with Yoshi's Wooly World, Mario Party 10, Xenoblade X, Splatoon, Star Fox, Zelda U, Kirby Rainbow Curse, Mario Maker (first ever level creator for Mario), Devil's Third and a Shin Megami Tensei crossover with Fire Emblem.

There are still a few AAA games on Wii U, just for good measure. A number of classics were ported including Assassin's Creed 3 and 4, Batman Arkham City and Origins, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 and Ghosts, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Deus Ex Human Revolution, Resident Evil Revelations and the blockbuster Watch Dogs releases Nov 18.

The Wii U also hosts a ""Virtual Console"", a digital selection on the eShop of classic retro games from the NES, SNES, Gameboy Advance and other platforms to follow in the near future, including DS games (made possible by the 2nd screen on the Gamepad). You'll find titles such as Super Mario Bros 3 and Super Mario World, Super Metroid, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, F-Zero, Zelda Link to the Past, Mega Man 1-7 and Mega Man X through X3, and many others too numerous to list. The system is also backwards compatible with the Wii, allowing you to play any gems you missed last generation like Xenoblade Chronicles, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, Zelda Skyward Sword and Super Mario Galaxy- all some of the highest rated games of the last decade.

As for the console itself, it's fantastic. Nintendo hardware is notoriously built to last a lifetime, and you should expect nothing less with the Wii U. The gamepad is an excellent addition, offering off-TV play on every game in the library, as well as dual screen mechanics in many games. You'll hit a golf ball with a Wiimote off the gamepad screen on the floor into the fairway on the TV, you'll solve dual screen puzzles, you'll fly through space on the TV while simultaneously warding off intruders inside your space ship on the gamepad screen, you'll free up TV screen real estate by having maps and inventories on the 2nd screen while you play, you'll race against somebody and each have your own screen while you play... You get the idea.

I will say this- sometimes, in certain games, you may find yourself not using the second screen. In instances such as these, you may find yourself wanting to use a smaller, more traditional controller. Well, fear not because most games are compatible with the Wiimote/Nunchuk, or at the very least the new Wii U Pro Controller (which rivals the Xbox controller IMO and gets around 80 hours battery life btw). The upcoming Smash Bros game will even let you use old Classic Wii Pro Controllers, or even a 3DS handheld for a controller if you like!

Gaming his changed a lot over the last 15 years. The majority of third-party games are now mega blockbusters focusing on realism and mature content. These games can be fun, but there's so much more out there than just that. I own a PS4 and an Xbox One, and they're great consoles, but my Wii U sees more playtime than either of them, and there's a reason for that. The console doesn't see nearly as many total games released every year, but the ones it does get makes it count. The online is still free, and external hard drives are supported. I really have nothing bad to say about the Wii U. I'm totally satisfied as a gamer with this console.

The best part about the system though, besides the games, is Miiverse. It's like an integrated social site for Wii U owners, like a mix between Facebook and Twitter but with gaming communities. Post screenshots, even YouTube videos in Mario Kart 8, post, comment, ask for help, draw pictures, etc. Miiverse is the central online hub for gamers to interact, and I'm rather surprised that neither of the other two console have anything similar. It's a great addition, and very addictive. I find myself posting screenshots every time I play now.

That's not to say the Wii U is perfect. Apps on the menu load slower than say, apps on the PS4 do, and there isn't any system-level in-game chat feature (though most online games have chat built in, and there is a video chat app that can be used while not playing games). The system is also region locked, so do take note of that if you plan on importing games. Western third-party support is rather slim, but again, for every Western AAA title you won't see, you'll have a Pikmin, or Mario Kart, or Donkey Kong Country, or Smash Bros, etc. Games you'll still be playing a year from now, 5 years from now...

4.0,True,"11 3, 2017",A3F8T3BRXRX5P3,B00BMFIXOW,JWINK,"This review is for the PS4 version.

After initially completing the Ezio Collection, I was hooked on the series and recently purchased Black Flag along with some of the other AC series.  I probably should not have played and completed Syndicate though prior to playing this one as I have gotten use to the smooth character movement and (even though some people didn't like it) the grapple hook that Syndicate has.

Like the Ezio collection, the controls for Black Flag are awkward to me as I tend to grab and jump onto/off something when I really didn't intend to do that.  For me, jumping and climbing is really difficult at times and find that I really miss the smoothness and ease of jumping and climbing that Syndicate has.  Granted this game came out before Syndicate, so I am willing to cut it a bit of slack with that but it is nevertheless frustrating at times.

As it is with the AC games, there is plenty to do with side quests and the collecting of things.  It is interesting to explore the varies areas around the islands.  There is a variety of different quests to do throughout but are pretty similar to what has been done before in the previous games so it does lack a bit in original game play.  I do think the ship and ship battles are an interesting new element to the game.

The collecting of the animus items and songs gets a bit repetitive and is probably my least favorite part of the game.  The songs are a bit of a pain to chase down, although you can pretty much stay where the chase starts to get it fairly easily when it returns.  At least the collectable items aren't as hard to find as the glitches in Syndicate.

The Island scenery is well done and detailed considering the game is 4 yrs old now and considering I am comparing it to Syndicate.  The water is especially detailed and nicely done.  The basic gameplay is pretty much the same as Ezio games.  I do like Syndicates fight controls a bit better as it was easier and worked a bit more smoothly.  I do think that this games missions are more challenging here in Black Flag than Syndicate though as I thought Syndicate's missions were pretty easy to complete.

I am not big fan of multiplayer but this does have an ok MP feature.

I have enjoyed playing the game though, but like with all the AC games, I do have some complaints.  As with the previous AC games, there is still issues with glitchy camera views at times that make it hard to see and do things, such as the scenery blocking your view in the middle of a fight as well as some random game crashes.  A minor gripe is that you cannot put the PS4 in rest mode without quitting the game.  The game button interaction is a bit finicky at times as well.  As with most Ubi games, I am also not a fan of the microtransactions to get extra stuff concept but luckily you can avoid that and still build your character without paying extra to do so.  I do think there is a lot of the sameness in the missions as previous games though and that is a bit of a bummer. I am not so crazy about the Animus office scenes and collecting of notes as it is a bit boring and seems a bit unnecessary to the game. I also think the game menus could be a little less clunky but that could be because I got use to the way Syndicates menus were done.

The story is pretty good though with a likeable character.  The ship battles are a neat addition, but I do think the ship controls are a bit clunky and make the battles a bit harder to manipulate than they should be.  There are plenty of things to keep you busy, although the missions can get a bit repetitive.

I am coming late to this game and got it for less than 20 bucks, but I still find it is fun enough and worth playing, especially if you are a fan of the series.

4.0,False,"03 11, 2007",AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B000GI7LOO,James Hiller,"I'm a big fan of simluation games: Sim City was one of my favorites (until the program got so demanding of my computer that it couldn't hold the upgrades!). I also loved Rollercoaster Tycoon. The aspects of designing and managing an amusement park appealed to my creative side; making those rollercoasters that made even the most stalwart riders sick was quite a thrill! So when I saw ""Thrilville"" for PS2, I was thrilled.

I hesitated buying the game at first, though. Much too often, I've purchased PS2 games that have interested me, only to find out that they are really made for kids, and the challenge aspect of the game isn't there for adults. So I waited, read some reviews, and then decided to go ahead and purchase it. I was glad that I did!

Thrillville is a riff on the popular ""Rollercoaster Tycoon"" game, and borrows some of the same elements. You are a park manager, required to build, plan, and improve Thrillville, a somewhat lackadaisical and dying theme park. You are thrown into the park, and within two minutes, you can be designing, or redesigning rollercoasters for your patrons. Your job is to improve the park so much that the next park becomes unlocked. You are given different missions in the park to perform (each mission has a success rate at gold, silver, or bronze). While, as an adult, I feared these missions would be dull or repetitive, they actually turned out to be one of the fun aspects of the game. I enjoyed having to train the staff (and don't worry, for you R Tycoon fans, there are NO lawn-mowing janitors in this game!), and enjoyed interacting with the people. Playing the mini-games also provided to be a fun surprise, although some of them are irritating at best! You'll recognize some of the mini-games as take-offs on old popular video games of the past.

My favorite part, hands down, is the coaster designs. It is incredibly easy to design a coaster for this game. The game offers tutorials to teach you, but honestly, I never looked at one. I just went in and started building. The individual pieces of the coasters are cheap enough that money never really becomes a huge issue in the game. You can design all types of thrilling turns, spins, loops, and corkscrews, depending on the type of coaster you design. One tricky aspect is that coasters take up a lot of electricity, so be wary of how long your coaster is. And one lesson that I learned: scarier is NOT always better, especially in the parks that are more ""family friendly"".

Overall, I have really enjoyed Thrillville. I never found anything super challenging, and found most of my experience just plain fun. For the last few nights, I've been dreaming of roller coaster design.... so maybe it's time that I return to reading some books instead of spending hours in ""Thrillville""!",Going to the amusement park!,1173571200,11,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

The character crator is nifty, the graphics are nice, I didn;t run into any bugs. BotB wasn't as interesting a story, but it gets points for being unique, you know, like getting to be a zombie-pirate in a NWN premium mod, only this one has portals & a parallel town, a bit like Silent Hill I suppose. What Obsidian & Ossian don't deliver in the way of premium mods can be aquired from the NWN2 Vault (user-made mods website),

Cons: The cons go to the other premium mods/expansion packs for NWN2 that aren't part of this package. They lack story & play more like Heroes of Might & Magic, only you can avoid the random encounters. Comparing them to NWN1's awesome extras is like comparing a pile of rocks to a plate of frash baked cookies. Mysteries of Westgate did finally come out (no thanks to Atari) but reviews clam that it plays just like Storm of Zahir. Concidering that BioWare turned it focus on Dragon Age after BotB came out, I'd say that the premium mods/expansions were an afterthought.","Please sir, can I have some more?",1248652800,,,

It is understandable, this is an action/adventure game so the focus has to stay fixed. Thing is you want to stop and hack ATM, or open doors that are off the beaten path. Everything in the game is to service the main story, with little to no exploration and in this game its lamentable, but not enough to deducted points.
The story while interesting is not very engaging and the voice acting other than the protagonist would seem more at home in your favorite manga/ anime rather than this seriously, highly polished, slick game.

Combat is fluid and engaging, think Batman's Arkum Asylum one button style fighting mechanics, with their own little twist. You can create your own combos as you progress through the story in Remember Me, so every punch and kick has some adverse affect. Pretty clever.

Also Nilin has the ability to re-arrange a persons memories making them do things and remember things differently than it occurred. This part of the game alone could have been a stand alone game in it of itself. It was a favorite of mine during the proceedings.

My parents bought me this game in 2003 when it first came out. I thought it was interesting from the way you fought but frustrating. The turn based system has where the computer goes through probabilities and deals damage accordingly. You can't just go up to an enemy and attack him with a melee weapon or blaster the way you can in most other Star Wars games, and this is very frustrating in the Star Forge when five or six Dark Jedi can surround your characters and kill them before you can move.

Your character starts out as a scout or soldier and slowly realizes he/she has extraordinary force potential.  The secondary and primary characters lead you to believe Malak's Sith Lord master is dead, only to tell you toward the end of the game that you are the Sith Lord who was captured, brainwashed by the force and given another identity.

Another aspect that impressed me was the music. It uses classic Star Wars sounds but recycles them into something different. I actually liked it better than the classic music, especially the sounds at the end of the Rakatan temple.

Of course, since they design console games, playing this game with a controller is a must to get the full experience the developers wanted us to have. But it is still amazing that we can have this console experience without having to buy a console. If less people complain and see how awesome this is, then we could get more PC ports in the future, like Metal Gear Solid V.

Anyways, about the game itself, the combat is great. My favourite aspect is the balance of making you feel challeneged while also making you feel powerful. I would compare this a lot to the Batman games where you are given a set of basic maneuvers (more unlock with XP) which the player learns to master as the game continues while always upping the challenge. Replaying earlier levels after finishing the game makes you feel unstoppable. You never feel frustrated (aside from maybe the final boss battle) since you know you have the tools to defeat whatever obstacle comes your way.

The combat is fluid, fast, smooth and tight. I have never experienced anything like this on PC and I really hope this is the start to more console exclusives coming our way. The pacing is also great. Everytime you feel actions are repetitive, a new enemy typ comes along, or better yet, you are treated to a boss fight. And these are METAL GEAR Boss Fights, so get ready for some epic stuff. The bosses remind me a bit of the ones in MGS 3 where they all have a particular ability and are a clan with a past that is never fully adressed, standing in your way one by one to stop you.

Another aspect I like is that the game still retains it's Metal Gear charms, like the sound the codec makes, the radar and the alert system which functions like the other metal gear games, giving you the option to be stealthy on several occasions. You probably won't be becuase this is an action game where any enemy presented to you can be stopped (though you are told to run and avoid enemies a few times) but if you so choose to, you can play this game in stealth. Awesome stealth kill options are given to you too and I would recomend trying this style a few times just for fun and to see the extra work that was put into the game.

For the cons, the camera does get in the way on several occasions. The story and how it relates to the metal gear lore is not great either. Also, there seem to be a few glitches here and there and the prompts during the final boss fight are downright unfair (unless it's another bug).

In conclusion, this is a great achievement for PC gaming, making the gap between the console experience that much smaller.

~The narrative enhances game play. Doesn't get in the way. Doesn't give you the impression the designer thought they were making an interactive movie. Doesn't (mostly) embarrass you with terrible dialog and wooden voice acting. More recent games tend to do all of these things.

~The game play is challenging. There are some corridors, entrances, scenarios that demand a single solution but there are also many large, open arenas that tempt you to come back over and over again to try a fresh tactical approach.

~Friendly deployable AI. These guys know their stuff and you can tell them to sit on their hands if they're getting in the way, which they rarely do, or concentrate them where they're useful.

~Cooperative play is a blast. If I were the sociable type I'd be at a ball game so it's worth lots of points that the campaign is as good as it is, but I do have a few pew-pew pals and the game is great fun with living wing-persons.

~Outside of the campaign, the Terrorist Hunt scenarios are enormously challenging and worth many curse-filled hours of single or coop play.

-one 'Future' digital game
-special console design
-fancy controller
-1 TB hard drive

-The BAD-
The forza bundle is $100.less, yet comes with a game you can play the day you buy it.
Some of you may be quick to point out that this dose come with the Limited Edition of halo5, (digital only)
and hey the Limited Edition of halo5 comes in at $100 so we're all good right?
well no, remember the forza 1tb bundle still came with a game, so if you got the forza bundle with the halo 5 Limited Edition, you'd also be spending $500, and you'd have ever thing shown here and an extra game!

So with this, if you buy before the 27th, you'll have no games, and be paying for 'two' games, and have none to play.
Of course I know this when buying, but it's still something Microsoft should have considered.

Second the Limited Edition of halo 5 mostly consists of paper and cards, with some nice info on it, but nothing you'd read more then once, and it's certainly not as cool as the reach bundle. it dose come with a metal puzzle like figure, but the instruction sheet is much larger then even the xbox one it's self, and double sided, not at all easy to build. but it dose come with a req pack.

-The GOOD!-

By far the BEST xbox bundle I've seen yet, much less busy looking then the halo4 bundle,
it looks subtle yet, elegant.
This comes with a digital download code so you can pre-load the game now, and play it on release.
(unfortunately this code combines the game, req packs, and animated movie in the same code,
so if you want to swap with a friend to get a hard copy of the game, you'll louse your req packs)
The controller also looks amazing! great detail, with some great laser etching!
And the icing on the cake with this system is the EXCLUSIVE startup, shutdown and disk eject sounds,
each sounds really nice, you can't really tell from most youtube videos,
but they do sound very nice without being to obvious or annoying.

Overall this is a very nice xbox one bundle, the fact that you can play anything with it when you buy it on release is annoying, but the unique design, exclusive sounds, and awesome controller are great! But it's up to you to decide if that's worth an extra $100,
Honestly I would have rather gotten the standard version of the game in this bundle for $450, or even $400 to match the forza bundle price.
but at the end of the day, it was the console design that sold me.
I wish it was cheaper, but I do not regret buying it.

4.0,False,"12 1, 2000",A1OEQP3GWNG263,B00004YLZM,Matt Dunphy,"The short: Great gameplay, great engine, excellent interface, awful story and acting. A fine addition to the Mech series of games. A solid, stable, fun game that doesn't require that you played any of the previous three to have a complete blast with it.
The long: I respectfully disagree with the review that gave this title one star because you can't make any Mech into a supermachine. That is precisely what makes this game better than all the ones that came before it. I have played ALL of the MW games, including the Virtual World cockpit sims, and this is the best yet. The game has been totally changed (and by the FASA guys themselves) from being just a computerized version of the paper game into a solid computer game that more accurately conveys what it should be like to be in one of these machines.
The shortcoming of the previous games was that Mech models didn't matter. You could take any one of them and put in any weapons, any equipment, any armor. You were limited only by total weight, so what was the difference?
Now there IS a difference. The missile racks on a Mech now really do have missiles in them (or nothing), and you can really hit those racks and blow them up. In the prior games you could hit a Mech in the waist and it would count as a ""torso side"" hit, regardless of what the structure of the machine was supposed to be. Now it plays far more like you'd think the real deal should. Two 75-ton Mechs are now completely different if they're different models, and you can play them with different tactics. You can use your knowledge of their structures to hit them where it hurts. Shouldn't it have been this way all along?
Game balance is totally different: Legs are way tougher to hit and to damage, so you can't cheap out as easily with leg or even head shots. Mechs accelerate, decelerate, and reverse faster, so if you crash into somebody, you don't ballroom dance with them at close range until somebody dies (and the meltdown from a death at close range is now greatly to be avoided--very cool); you can break off easily and continue to run and gun. Every Mech battle is now the extended duel it should be--no easy way out, and no cheap argument-ending superweapons like the Ultra AC/20. Now you've got to actually fight. If you don't like solid tactical fighting, then go play any first-person shooter, ninnies.
Weapon select and grouping is now totally different; the HUD is much simpler and more effective to use, and the Mech lab is equally simplified and effective. Wingman command is perhaps the best such game interface yet invented; very quick and it works.
Missile play also is done right this time; long-range missiles launch in an arc to the target, short-ranges are dumbfire and Streaks always hit without needing a lock. Other toys like AMS and BAP really work now, and have a noticeable effect and advantage during play. The new way that the missiles launch in a ripple-shower (instead of all at once) is more fun. This means that evasive action works. Now rather than either getting hit with the full load or totally missed, you can do things like dodge some and try to let AMS handle some, and everything in between. It also means that you need skill and strategy as a missile marksman, which wasn't really the case before.
The Mechs themselves have never looked better. They're highly detailed, distinctively blacken on damage, limp, stagger, run, walk, recoil, fall, and DIE awesomely. The graphics look great. Weapon effects are intense and the sounds are rich and throaty. You feel like you're dealing out some hurting even if you're only scratching paint when you unleash a machine gun. The AI is no longer dirt-stupid, puts up a great fight and won't sit there while you snipe from long range or pull other tricks that used to work. It's much more equivalent to the great bot AI that you see in first-person shooters like Unreal Tournament or Quake.
The single-player campaign is 25 full missions, far longer in play time than MW3. Unfortunately the story is as awful as most other computer games. Starcraft or Half-Life this is not. I can't remember seeing worse acting since high school, so I can't give this five stars. It's solid in just about every other way, though.

Graphics were rather good- even if they did reuse the scenery way too much. But what really makes this game shine is its actors. Whether you are playing as a Marine, a Predator, or an Alien- you really become that character!
As a Marine, you are sent to investigate a colony that has been ravaged by aliens. Then you get separated from your squad and things start to go really bad. Its dark and scary, and as your little motion sensor beeps away you find yourself jumping at every turn. It feels exactly like the movies!
They nailed the Predator too! All his famous abilities and weapons are at your disposal, which pretty much makes you one unstoppable killer. Turn yourself invisible. Switch to infravision. Jump from tree-limb to tree-limb. Then decimate your prey in any number of ways. You are a Predator, and the game captures that feeling perfectly!
 Finally, it is the Aliens that truly make this game for me. They can walk on walls. They have acidic blood. A sharp sense of smell. Fierce claws and a whip-like tail. Sickest of all- They eat their victims to regain health! The aliens can be rather disorienting to control at first, but once you get the hang of it- you are sure to fall in love with the little critters! It really makes you think and play in a totally alien manner- very original!
Singleplayer was a lot of fun, but Multiplayer really makes AVP II shine. Take the three species and throw them in an unforgiving arena, and see which is the fittest. It really is hectic, and quite a ride.
However, there  is one aspect of multiplayer that really needs improvement. The ""game launcher"". When you go to find  an internet game to join, it lists all the servers along with the number of players, the ping, and the game types. You can then sort the game by any of these aspects to find just the game you want to play. It provides filters to make this even easier- but unfortunately, there is no way to save your filter preferences. Instead, you have to put them in every time you want to find a new game. This is really a nuisance! There is also no way to remove all the servers that require a password (would be nice), or download the map from the server if you don't have it (instead of getting kicked out). Maybe I'm asking too much, but other games (like Half-Life) have been able to solve these little inconveniences for years now! Maybe after a few more patches...?

That's the short version of the main background story for MK3. Naturally a new crowd of fighters (along with some of the old line-up) gather to either put a stop to it or encourage it. There are fourteen fighters to choose from. Old favourites like Shang Tsung, Liu Kang, Kano, Sonya, Jax, Sub-Zero and Kung Lao return. The new fighters include Sindel (Shao Kahn's ""queen"" herself), Sheeva (the first player-controllable four-armed character), Kabal (a weird warrior with a mask), Cyrax & Sektor (two ""automated"" ninjas from Sub-Zero's clan), Stryker (a baton-weilding cop) and Nightwolf (your typical culture-preserving Red Indian). The gameplay itself has changed from MKII. Now there's a ""run"" button and new ""auto combos."" The fighting has been speeded up quite a bit and the fatality time is very reduced. MK3 reduces the strategic approach of the previous games and is more geared towards button mashing. The basis of auto combos is choosing the right button at the right time.
Since MK3 takes place mainly in North America, there are no more shaolin temples. The character and background graphics are quite good in the SNES conversion. The graphic resolution has also improved a notch from previous MK games. In a couple of stages, performing an uppercut on your opponent sends him through the roof of that stage and the fight will be transferred to the stage directly above! That's a tad innovative as fighting game ideas go. Aside from fatalities, babalities and friendships, MK3 introduces the ""animality"" (which requires ""showing mercy"" towards your defeated opponent before it can be performed). As for the fatalities they are fun to watch, like Liu Kang's ""MK1 drop"" and Kabal's ""ugly face"" and gory at the same time (though not as much as MKII). For the first time in the series, the player had the choice of three paths to take, either novice, warrior or master. Music and sound-wise it's okay as far as MK games go. Fluid controls too, though they should've made some of the finishing moves a bit easier to perform. The computer AI (artificial intelligence) is quite aggressive even in the ""easy"" mode.
If you have the previous MK games, don't hesitate on this one. Though not as original as MKII, if you got tired of its slow pace, and want more diversity in the finishing moves, Mortal Kombat 3 is for you. To get the most out of it however, you should play with the cheat codes on.

Gameplay- Playing the game involves some cool puzzles, but some areas are frustrating! (one are I spent around an hour on even though it lasted only a few minutes, it was the first major driving scene). One interesting aspect is that the standard enemies (I saw them called humanz in a walkthrough) can only be killed by fire (with the stronger ones requiring more fire introduced before dying). The driving aspect of the game is cool, as the physics aren't the most realistic, but thats not really a bad aspect of a game which most of the game is spent on foot. The game is different from other survival horror games because you get more than enough ammo, so you can be creative (shooting doors apart when you don't have time for example). The healing system is cool, I like the difference from when it is a small wound or a bleeding one (which can only be treated with the rare bandage, and you leave a blood trail which attracts monsters). The 3rd person cam is almost impossible to use, so I go to my preferred view of first person.

Graphics- Not the best, but they are good enough for me to get an easy grasp on the world around me, and also good enough to look into detail on objects. The fire doesn't look the best, but we have been spoiled with games like Far Cry 2 and such (both games have fire which spreads realistically, but Far Cry has better graphics, being newer).

Features- items play a large role in this game, and with a limited inventory (nope, no more carrying 1 ton with elder scrolls, still that is a good game series though, elder scrolls) you must decide what you most need, whether you use your flashlight and need batteries, or you load up on ammunition. The game also uses combining items as an important feature, such as moving a the liquid from a 3/10 full bottle to a 7/10 full bottle for a full bottle that is more explosive (when shot or used as a molotov). Also, you can use the liquid on explosive bottles to pour on you ammunition giving you 1 clip load of incendiary rounds (as in they damage those humanz, if you shoot em in the right place, or they set a wooden object on fire from far away) which aren't realistic, but they are awesome!

In conclusion, alone in the dark 5 is a great game with a few flaws that require patience, the tab key, and maybe a walkthrough (which won't ruin the game... they never get it thorough enough to do THAT).","Good, with a few setbacks, but still a great game.",1240963200,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

3.0,False,"01 7, 2016",A3ULPB81JD4OGA,B00002SW2M,Kelly Groce,"The game should strictly be for fighting game fans only.  It is a total copycat of Street Fighter 2 in almost everyway character designs, 2 main characters with the same move patterns, mini boss, 8 or so characters to battle against.  The arcade version was much tougher than this home console.

What really hurts the game is the lack of playable characters.  You get to fight against the standard 8 opponents just like SF2 but you can only play 2 of them unless you are playing a verse game against another player.  The spirit gauge was not a bad idea and several other games have used the idea since the release of this game.  But it seems like it takes forever for your spirit gauge to fill up and your special attacks seem to have a delay making it easy for the computer or a friend to block what is coming.  If you have 10 to 15 minutes to waste it is not a bad game but most average players will quickly get bored and want to play something else.  It does not have very much replay value to it, once you cruise through story mode.  The last boss has a desperation attack that is the highlight of the game IMO.  Some of the characters were pretty cool like Mr. Big, the animation was decent.  Ryo could should a massive fireball that looked cool onscreen.

The King of Fighters games were far superior than these original ports.  Like Fatal Fury SNK came up with a nice library of characters but only when they put them altogether did they start producing great fighting games.  Art of Fighting like Fatal Fury on the SNES is very mediocre.  There were far worse fighting games made for the SNES Shaq Fu, Battle Blaze, Pit Fighter to name just a few.  I would actual rate this game 2 1/2 stars old school fighting game fans will enjoy it but that's about it.  SF2 and Mortal Kombat were far superior games on the SNES in everyway.

1. The butt slam novelty wears off about half way through the introduction of it. I figured this would be the case after watching the videos they released of it in the last few months, but they practically force you to use it by sending enemies coming from literally every direction right for you.
2. They purposefully put mission specific targets in hard to reach areas that you need to figure out how to jump and boost to. You could spend 5 minutes looking in the mission area for something before you figure out that you need to find a way to boost yourself on top of the building you're inside of.
3. The accuracy is way off. You would think something with 97% accuracy would hit what you're aiming at 97% of the time, but its more like 60%.
4. I never knew I hated the Australian accent before this game. It literally bombards you with it. It was fun for the first few hours but halfway through the game, some Aussie is describing some mission specific item you need to collect and you have no idea what the heck he's talking about.

Yes some predetermined main characters come and go but they are put in the story to not get you too emotionally invested in them. This makes the story more dynamic and less predictable unlike many other jrpgs where the main cast is together till the end and have a happy ending in the end. The ending is pretty nice and is not totally sad neither happy.
The graphics are just ok but graphics is not everything in a game. The battle system is very entertaining with tons of options and other in depth opportunities to make you engage with more detail into it (although it becomes a little bit too gimmickish sometimes). It lets you change game difficulty during the game itself and expand your gaming experience by obtaining more rare objects when you want it when choosing hard mode or just have lazy fun with the simple difficulty in tedious dungeons.
Has beautiful animations and top notch both Japanese and English voice acting. The music is spectacular and the characters are super likable with tons of in game scenes and skits that many result funny. The mythology it's also good and even though it has some things that sometimes may not have sense, everything is correctly explained and justified most of the time.

Switching between the characters got old really fast, and you're forced to use all four of the characters, as some friends have to do certain tasks.  It might have been ok if it was just one of ND's friends, but I got confused, couldn't remember which friend had picked up which clue, etc., and you can't switch directly from say Bess to George, you have to have Bess switch to Nancy then Nancy switch to George.  Then if you figure out that you forgot to do something as Bess, you have to do it all over again George to Nancy, Nancy to Bess.  Bah!

As other reviewers mentioned there aren't many puzzles to this game, it's a lot of dialogue with the suspects, or running around as Nancy's friends, picking up clues and dropping them off for Nancy.  I was so disappointed with Captive Curse that I didn't pre-order this one, waited for it to come out on Amazon.  For the next game, I might wait for a price drop or skip it entirely.  I haven't finished this game, am not sure if I'll plow through or just give up.  I've replayed many of the old games, but don't think this has much replay value at all.

I have been searching a long time for a computer game that can come close to the depth PnP provides,sadly I have come to the conclusion the only way to really enjoy D&D is to play it PnP the way it was intened. I wasn't very happy with the Baldur's Gate games, too hard (in PnP or in a Neverwinter Nights multiplayer game a DM can adjust the difficulty on the fly), too linear, poor graphics, poor multiplayer. However the baldur's gate games came a lot closer to D&D then this game does. The Baldur's gate games were a lot more than just Dungeon Crawlers alingment played a big part in the game. This game is a Dungeon Crawler, thats it! This game completely ignores other vital parts of D&D that even Baldurs Gate and Neverwinter nights included such as Alignment. That is what seperates D&D from other games is how important alinment is. Actually Neverwinter Nights sadly while not an MMORG is a lot more funner and closer to PnP in multiplayer mode then this game. Especially Neverwinter Nights Custom content where players tweak the game to include extra stuff in there such as Alinment, dieties, food and rest rules, added roleplaying rules. Neverwinter Nights while the game itself is not that great, the custom modules DM's create make the game very close to PnP. Unfortunately a side effect with any game that players have to pay a monthly fee to play, Dm's can't be strict about who they allow to play the game after all that would be a stupid money making decision. So you are not getting the best  role-players and in turn it ruins the game. At least with Neverwinter DM's can be picky about who they allow on their server, require players to actively contribute to game content, kick out anti-social solo players (there is no such thing as a solo PnP game), and write a bio about there character that must be well written! This is the heart of PnP and this game completely omits this. Characters on some Neverwinter servers must roleplay their alingment well or else be punished! Alignment is completely out of the picture in this game. In D&D players need to pray to a diety to gain favor and in turn the diety will help the player out. Again many Neverwinter Nights servers include this aspect of gameplay, but Stormreach completely omitted it. Other online games do a much better job of including a lot of added details about characters lives in the game than this game such as Star War Galaxies, World of Warcraft, Ulitma Online, and Everquest.

Anyway, I picked it up after reading several things on it. And I must say, I was really disappointed in what the game had. In my opinion, it shouldn't qualify as a Sonic game. The two player mode is really lacking something. The music doesn't even compare to the awesome compositions in Sonic 1 and 2. Yes, I know they included a few songs and stuff from the first game, but that's about it.
The first thing I noticed was the character choices. If you play Sonic 2 or 3, you have a choice of playing as Sonic, Tails, or both. This game didn't have that, and that was a sorry thing to see. Amy Rose is one of my favorite characters, but I really think that the game wouldn't lack anything if she wasn't a character in the game. The levels and their titles weren't all that spectacular. Sure, they had a lot more boxes than the first games, and what really made me mad was the invincibility. I know they kept the same music, but the invincibility that's a Sonic trademark is the sparkles that surround the character. This game takes it from Sonic Adventure 2, and that made me upset, because it's just not...Sonic. The moves were hard to get used to, and (I'm sorry that I'm going too in-depth with this stuff, but....) all of the characters shouldn't have attacks, like in Sonic Adventure. Another thing that really disappointed me was that the levels were just too easy. There didn't seem to be enough badniks and there weren't enough turns and cool stuff like that.
I think that people who aren't die-hard Sonic fans would like this game, and it's pretty simple. But I warn those who love Sonic like I do-this game is not like traditional Sonic.
My reccomendation? Avoid this game, especially if you are a big Sonic fan.

A little background: I had a launch PSP back when they first came out. I liked it then, but it was very limited by a lack of software and support.

Fast-forward to today: I'm quite happy with the PSP-2000 as a media device. It's lightweight, slim, and doesn't take up much more space than an iPod touch. It has user-replaceable battery packs, and you can upgrade the memory as you see fit. I grabbed an 8GB Memory Stick at a bargain price, and I'm happy with the amount of data I can store on it.

Other bonuses versus an iPod touch:

* Controls for games.
* Built-in stereo speakers.
* WiFi switch allows you to turn off WiFi when you're not using it.
* Bigger screen.
* Extended battery available.
* Comes with wall charger, but can be charged via USB just like the iPod.
* Costs MUCH less than iPOd touch.
* Web browser has limited support for Shockwave Flash (iPod doesn't).
* Supports more media formats.

All in all, the PSP is a great choice. It's too bad Sony is still marketing it as a gaming console, instead of aiming it at the adult crowd looking for a media device. On the gaming side, however, I'm having a blast playing PSOne games that I downloaded from the Sony Store. The iPod touch can't play Castlevania Symphony of the Night, can it?

Yep. Definitely happy with this purchase.",A Fair iPod touch Alternative,1221696000,5,,

This games seems to be the typical spin-off you find out there upon a new movie release. You may know the games. They typically all seem to run off of a generic gameplay engine, feature some good clips from the movie, follow along or extend the movie's storyline, and are great fun till the newness wears off. Novelty games. This one is definitely fits that bill.

The gameplay is a side scroller that you can use different characters (surfs) which have different abilities to win different levels. You are expected and in fact required to re-visit levels with new un-locked smurfs to acquire all the hidden stars to un-lock new levels and characters. You collect the many surf-berries that are on each level. You can get hit by bad-guys and will only loose if you get hit while you don't have any berries. When you get hit and you have berries they are all knocked out of your character. As long as you grab a least one you will be able to get hit again and not loose a turn. This type of game play naturally challenges you to collect as many berries as possible and reach the finish line with all your collected berries, but I must say it is very frustrating to carefully navigate the level only to lose 400 berries right before the finish. You want to collect as many as possible and get more points but it really counts for not much in the end.

The game lost its appeal after several days and no one ever plays it now that the movie has been out for a while. I doubt this game will get played again except if a Smurfs 3 movie comes out and then at that time only for a little bit to play along side the Smurfs 3 game that will probably be released. Or if a kid comes over who hasn't played it and for some reason is really interested in Smurfs then maybe it will get played again.

I would only buy this game new if it absolutely fit the situation, and you needed it now. Otherwise I would look to rent it or buy used. Only could just barely muster 3 stars on this one.

1. difficulty mode select

2. ability to turn vibrations and subtitles on or off

3. Colorful, eyecatching visuals

CONS:

1. No tutorial

2. No save option if played on PSII

3. No Pause option (pushing select will make you start from the beginning or quit)

4. No level simple enough for younger children - notes can be quick and complex

5. Oftentimes bad music with vocalists that are too goofy or difficult to understand

I picked this up, hearing it followed along the PaRappa games. Familiar with the others, I I conquered this one - only having to do 2-3 songs twice.

At first, the songs are clear and catchy, in my opinion. But the last half really disappointed me - the lyrics became difficult to understand, and the voices were either too goofy or grainy to rely on them for help with the beat. Additionally, the songs themselves were musically displeasing and I found myself wanting to hurry up and get through a song just so it would be over.

In conclusion, I think it's a fun game for people who like the music-based style, but not anything special. Buy it used and cheap if you wanna play it - like I did.

*  A compelling storyline that lets you build your own character.

*  NO TNA Knockouts.

If you want to shoot better than choose this gun for House fo the Dead.  It helps you aim at your targets a lot better because you feel the control of the cursor better.  The Wii remote is good choice, but with this gun, you can actually aim with gun sight. Also, I like the feeling with using a gun to play a shooter game.

The down side with this gun is it's a bit front heavy. After a week using this gun I got the hang of it and it's not as heavy as before.  It's still heavy sometimes but I sill shoot better with it so I like it. Also, you may feel like holding the gun's front side with your other hand, which actually would help you aim better too.

A minior problem with this gun is the trigger isn't as fast as I would like it to be. I think it should be slightly faster so we can fire the gun faster. You don't want to go crazy with it too and start squeezing the trigger too fast or you might break it.

The overal gameplay is really good and there is definitely some cross-over on the story missions mainly with what takes place at the Museum. You know what I'm talking about if you have played the original GTA4 story with Niko Bellic. Rockstar did a great job of allowing you to play that 1 mission from every characters point of view so you get a feel how they escaped the museum. I thought that was a nice touch !!

 I didn't care for Lost & The Damned (LAD) as much as The Ballad of Gay Tony (TBOGT). In LAD its motorcycles and many of the missions involve riding a bike. I hated the original GTA4's ""mechanics"" with the bike and it was SO EASY to get dislodged. I would never want to ride one. In LAD it is grealy improved and the motorcycles handle ALOT better !! The story is a little ""so-so"" and I never tired the multiplayer so I cannot commnet on that. On the other hand TBOGT is pure over-the-top fun that is a throw back to San Andreas .... the cars are souped up, the weapons do more damage and they bring back base-jumping !!

It uses a top down perspective while walking around the island and uses a 3D look a la Doom when exploring the various buildings and caves while offering you multiple weapons to use. It uses the likenesses of the dinosaurs and some of the main characters that appeared in the movie. The graphics, sounds and music are spot on and help you get into the game. It controls very easily and you get used to quickly. So why do I give this game 3 stars?

First off, this is a VERY LONG, exploratory and adventure game. The island is huge and you have to explore caves and buildings, which in its own, eats up a lot of time. Aside from figuring out which weapons to use against which dinosaurs, your memory skills will be tested as the game offers no hints as to which direction you should do or how to complete tasks. No map system is available while underground or in buildings so you'll get lost plenty of times. You start out with 5 lives and have infinite continues but no password or save system is available. If you intend to beat this game, you'll have to do it in one shot. After you finished all the objectives, you head back to the helipad. There, you get treated to the game's ending: the intro presentation of landing on the helipad when you first start playing....in reverse.

3.0,False,"09 26, 2015",A1MTEL1KUN5G68,B00JKM06HG,Sean Filkins,"Open world games have always bored me. I think I realized this back when the original Assassin's Creed was released. That said, being I am a huge fan of the Metal Gear Solid series, I figured, ""Heck, this game can't be so bad. It'll at least have a great story to follow."" Stop! Stop right there!

If you were thinking this, then stop. Please, stop. Because this game literally has no story to it beyond the initial cutscenes and events and a short closing section. The game is basically a series of (mostly) easy missions that have no real bearing on the overall story the game is trying to tell. I say ""(mostly) easy"" because there are a few downright annoying missions. That said, The Phantom Pain is a very easy game. Just load up a bazooka and you're set.

This game is a fragmented experience just like the PSP game. But that game had something that The Phantom Pain does NOT. It had a story. It had characters. Those characters interacted and you learned to care for them. In TPP, you don't care about anything. None of the character say or do anything much outside the main mission objective descriptions and short briefing tapes. The MGS series is known for long story segments...they are all gone here. People will defend this game to the end, but I am absolutely annoyed by the final product. Who knows, maybe Konami rushed Hideo Kojima into releasing a bare bones version of his story? Maybe there were many scenes left on the cutting room floor due to time constraints? I don't know. And we probably never will. Not any time soon, anyway.... This game should have told, IN MY OPINION, the story leading up to the original Metal Gear game, bridging the gap between the times. It didn't. It didn't even bother.

This game basically goes through the motions, sometimes slugging, sometimes hurtling, its way to the obvious final battle that all games in this series are known for. Nothing within the game's world or story gets resolved really unless you count in the tacked on epilogue segments, some of which effectively ruin anything good there was to say about TPP. This game is awkward all around, having you jump into random side missions and main story missions. The main story missions fail to be much different than the side ones to the point where you almost forget that you are playing a main mission rather than a side op.

The game didn't do a single thing I wanted it to. Don't get me wrong, I went in with high hopes and had a darn good playing it for a while, but after 40 hours and seeing the epilogue morsels of story...I was left with a sour taste in my mouth. I knew, going into The Phantom Pain, that it was going to disappoint me in the gameplay department: which it both did and didn't. I had some fun and lots of frustration with this game. But in the end, the game didn't deliver. It didn't tell me a good story. Heck, it didn't tell a story at all. No characters worth remembering. And the past characters like Ocelot were so unlike themselves compared to the other games in the series that this whole thing just felt alien to me. And Kiefer being Big Boss just made it worse, I think.

All I can say is this: If you do buy this game, buy it expecting a letdown. It will let you down. The cutscenes are all 3 minutes or less. There's no codec/radio sections to drive the game along and develop characters. You're basically playing a really sophisticated Assassin's Creed with lots of complex systems and RPG elements.

What I loved most about the other game was the controls: You did everything with the stylus. I love that! This game sadly doesn't use the stylus at all. There are a few actions that require you to slide your thumb on the touch screen, but most of those are clunky and awkward, and can also be done, much easier, instead with the ""A"" button.

In the other game when you had a group of characters with you, the only character visible on the screen was the current character you were using. In Indy you have 2 characters on screen which can be annoying because the tag-along character usually gets in the way. I had to swap to the other character just to move it out of the way before swapping back to resume what I was doing.

Yes, they have in the description that this console version was written from the ground up, so that does provide an excuse.  So to be fair, all I will say is that this version is nothing like the computer version.  It has very few similarities at best and the game play is very different.  They obviously made this for the casual gamer.  Serious gamers will think this version is a joke.

To call this a next generation game would be an insult.  The graphics are sub-par at best and is really nothing better than you might see on the Wii console.  I am not knocking the Wii, I am just providing a comparison.  This console version also lacks the many wonderful musical scores from the PC version.

They have animated characters guiding your way through the game.  They all speak in gibberish that gets very annoying the longer you play.  Again, the graphics for these characters are bad for a next gen console.

The victory options are non-existent.  In fact, there are hardly any game options.

I don't know.  When comparing to the PC version, I could beat this version up all day and write a novel.  This is going to be good for the CIV novice that has never played the PC version or maybe thought the PC version was too hard to play.

I've contacted Ubisoft to troubleshoot and they've verified my system should be running the game fine. System temperatures are running within the normal operating ranges (verified with Everest, as well as Speccy). I also have a Corsair H80 GPU Liquid Cooler. I'm running on the lowest graphics settings, although I shouldn't have to, since my build runs Tera, Skyrim, BF3, all at the highest resolution.

The problem is, every 5-10 minutes, the game (after running smoothly without a hitch for those 5-10 minutes), crashes unexpectedly and inexplicably to the desktop. I can still hear the background voices and sounds of the Boston streets, but the program just stops responding and I have to Ctl+Alt+Del and end the program.

I bought the darn thing on PS3 just to play the game, and am pursuing a refund on the PC version. I've been on the Ubisoft forums, and there are a few who experienced the same issues. I'll install on a 32 bit windows system later on and see if I have the same problems. Really disappointed since I was looking forward to the game and it seems like it'd be fun.

It has it's shortfalls, but usually you won't even notice them compared to this game's strengths.  I'll list some of the shortfalls first, just to get them out of the way.

First of all, the original lack of variety in weapons was annoying.  Being Japanese with an STG44 was rather unrealistic, especially at Wake Island (since the Japanese invasion of Wake took place roughly 2 years before the STG44 was created.)  When I'm Japanese, I want to use Japanese equipment.  Same with Russians.  Eventually patches brought some variety which helped a lot.  Either way, it really has very little impact on the game if any, it's just annoying.

The infantry combat also needs work.  It's really awkward, I don't really know how to explain it.  The bolt-action rifles are terrible.  I was also displeased with the fact that it took them forever to add the M1 Garand, and even after they did only on Pacific maps and it sucks.  However it's tolerable.

Connecting to multiplayer games needs work too.  Navigating the menu is cumbersome and irritating at times.  However once you get into a game you'll soon forget.

The things I like about this game surpass what I don't by far.  Just the sheer possibilities of what you can do makes this game so adaptable.  The possibility of opening up an attack on an enemy point by bombarding them with artillery and fighter bombers followed by an armored attack supported by infantry is just something you just can't get in most games (even though it never happens because players rarely want to act as a team.)  It's fun to deflate the egos of arrogant players in tanks by crashing your jeep into them, killing them and yourself if you fail to bail out.  Of course there are players who do the typical multiplayer behavior, like just take off in tanks, apcs or jeeps without offering anyone a ride (even if you ask for them to stop) park vehicles on runways, drive right into their own infantry, killing them without appologizing and those who contribute nothing to their team, just waiting for planes to respawn and kill any of their own teammates who might get the plane before them.  Make no mistake, multiplayer games are usually full of immature, arrogant, self absorbed bigots who tell you how to play, yell at you for no reason, whine about any little thing and spew forth homophobic remarks.  Even so, Battlefield 1942 is still a fun game even with these annoyances.  Very few things are more rewarding than blowing up an enemy tank with your own panzerscreck or bazooka.  Spectating skilled pilots can also be a great show.

My conclusion is Battlefield 1942 is an excellent game despite minor issues and the other players.  It's very adaptable and is full of options, opportunities and fun.  As a gamer I highly recommend it.",Very Nice,1094515200,11,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Unfortunately for all the super critics another game has been wrongly reviewed. Fortunately for the gaming masses that are not snobs and know it alls SOCOM 4 delivers an exciting and well polished PS3 exclusive military shooter.

One of the most crucial factors that determines the playability of a modern shooter are fine tuned controls. I can easily say that SOCOM 4 has some of the best controls of any shooter I've ever played, which is a very long list. They are so precise and fluid that they easily rival the best that is available on the market. The controls are also one of the best offered currently on the PS3.

The AI on the game is not perfect but what game can say that? The ally AI, which has been harshly criticized by other reviewers, is competent and follows orders 99% of the time. While not fully at 100% the ally AI will, at the very least, respond the second time you command them 100% of the time.

SOCOM 4 has some great graphics that are very detailed and provide some great atmosphere. The character models look good and display good emotions and facial expressions. While the story isn't the greatest I've ever heard, it is told well and the acting is good enough to see through to the end. There are some exciting scenes that really elevate the action and drive the story along. I haven't had an opportunity to play online seeing as how I'm right in the middle of the big PSN outage/hijacking but I can say that the beta I played prior to the games release reminded me alot of most other multiplayers out today

All in all SOCOM 4 deserves 4/5 stars at the very least. I'm giving it 5/5 to help raise the score to at least 4/5. The game is very enjoyable and while not mentioned much earlier the squad dynamics are fluid and responsive and mirror the Ghost Recon series.

The game types are: dogfight, team dogfight, capture the flag, keep away (a sort of tag-like game), team keep away, and wild chicken (a game similar to capture the flag, but with only one flag).
The downside to live is that you're dependent on the number of other people online.  You can always find a dogfight game going on, but it's harder to find a keep away or wild chicken game going on at 7 on Sunday morning.
The single player mode is good, but repetitive.  There's only so much flying and shooting you can do before you get tired of seemingly doing the same thing over and over again.  You can get into AA guns and fire from the ground or from vehicles, but overall this doesn't add too much in the way of variety.  The storyline is pretty ridiculous (not in the good way like odd world), and it lacks any sort of complexity.
Overall, I really wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you have x-box live.

The PC version does look better than this, but this should be expected.

I am loving the controls, it just feels right. There are just enough buttons to do what you need to do. Moving around is so much easier, and the dodge feature is a nice addition.

I like that they took the auction house out of the game entirely, I hated it. It took all the fun out of finding drops, since you could always find something better on the AH. No more dealing with a million filters and spending hours searching for gear every time you level up. In the console version, you use what you find and deal with it. Much more fun IMO!

Pumped to have friends over for co-op too. I don't understand the haters here, this is definitely worth $60.

The right mouse button no longer has any resistance, and so any inadvertent touching results in the mouse thinking i pressed the button.  While i can lay my finger on the left mouse button, my other finger must constantly hover just above the right mouse button.  There have been so many inadvertent right clicks because of this, that i finally switched back to my standard microsoft optical mouse, because it was ruining gaming for me.

On top of that, I've experienced what a lot of others have complained about on here, the mouse's optical tracker going haywire.  Generally what happens to me is the mouse won't sense ""down"" anymore, but it sense left, right and up just fine.  I jiggle the mouse around and lift if off the pad a couple of times and it seems to fix itself, but this is unacceptable when you're playing a video game, especially if you're online and others are depending on you.  I've seen reviewers claiming that this is because of dust on the pad, but I don't believe that.  The microsoft mouse i mentioned has no such problems, and it is optical as well.  I even took to regularly using a lint roller on the pad, and that made no difference at all.

Over all, a cool looking mouse, but for all the feature, none of them are worthy of extra stars if the unit does not even function basically as a mouse should.  This thing feels like a rip off to me, and if I wasn't fairly certain I was past the warranty point, I'd contact the company and try to get my money back.  No faith in their own product, and you'd apparently be wise to follow suit.

UPDATE: They wrote me back to say they will honor the warranty IF i produce the original purchase receipt.  Not possible since I bought this on amazon a few months back, used.

When you are good you basicly shoot wild shots at your enemy.  You have to line them up with the little blue circle.  That was kind of stupid.

Every inFamous game is a sandbox with endless freedom, like GTA, but you've got super powers.  While other super hero games are limited to established abilities, whatever was introduced in their respective comics, inFamous gives you Cole MacGrath and now Delsin Rowe, characters with completely fresh powers that grow until the game's completion.

inFamous 2, in my opinion was hands down, the best game for the PS3 and my personal favorite game of all time.  Suckerpunch provided the aforementioned concept, incredible voice acting, beautiful graphics, great story & characters, finely crafted cut scenes & well written dialogue and fun, fun, fun gameplay.  It's a 10.  So inFamous Second Son was anticipated with high standards to be met or surpassed.

Upon first hearing Delsin talk, I said to myself, ""Oh screw this guy.""  I immediately missed Cole  But as the story progressed, he quickly grew on me.  There are definitely aspects to Delsin that make for a far more thrilling character to play.  As soon as you get your first power, taking into consideration this is a vast open world sandbox, graphics are absolutely stunning, comparable to Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes.  The fire effects, smoke, streets, lights and reflections, all just pop.  The variety of people occupying Seattle, however, felt lazy.  I saw the same faces over and over again, but I am guessing this was deliberately kept minimal to concentrating efforts where the pay off was obvious.  It just becomes noticeable when some of your missions involve looking for people.

I'm big on great music in video games and the score in ISS felt at times like it was trying to be cool.  But generally it worked.  Just occasionally distracting.  Nothing beats inFamous 1's soundtrack in this franchise.

When present, story, dialogue and cut scenes are just as solid as inFamous 2.  But these character moments are bare bones, mostly riding the book ends of the game, leaving you longing for much more in between.  The game wants you to care more for these characters than is warranted because they are simply not very involved in the journey.  To this issue, there is no real counterpart to keep you company and enjoy your growth with you like Zeke did for Cole in inFamous.  One very important element lacking in this installment which was present in previous was a sense of urgency, a constant driving force.  Particularly with inFamous 2, the stakes kept getting higher and throughout the entire game there was a looming danger.  inFamous Second Son however doesn't keep you aware of why you're playing.  What sends you on this mission to Seattle doesn't really come up again until the game is over.  The game sought to maintain the serious tone of inFamous, but Delsin doesn't really experience any down points or set-backs like Cole did.

Despite the aforementioned shortcomings, inFamous Second Son has some really great surprises.  The previous installments had far more variety in terms of optional side missions and as a completionist, I found myself annoyed at the unforgivably identical side missions that filled each district.  The game plagiarized itself about 20 times.  There is a spray paint side mission in every district, sometimes more than one.  I have no idea why this is part of the game and made to feel important.  It may as well have been a cut scene you are awarded for watching, as that's how much you participate in the spray paint side missions.  They're not even missions.  They're just a hassle you have to do if you want to do everything.  And just when this was about to take it's toll on me, ISS hit me with something strong, near the mid-way point that rejuvenated my energy.  Then it does this again at the 75% mark and even up to the end.  That being said, the second half of the game is far more interesting than the first half.

Regardless of your powers, upgrades and the area you are playing, what you you encounter most are the DUP: Depart of Unified Protection.  They all work for the big bad boss you meet at the beginning and know you are going to have to fight.  But what might have helped is if Sucker Punch gave this boss at least one or two mini bosses you had to face.  Instead, you deal with the same henchmen again and again.  And while they get progressively stronger, thusly more difficult and interesting to battle, it can't help but feel a bit redundant.  No other super bosses is pretty disappointing, knowing they did this better in previous installments.

The most frustrating thing I learned only after the fact is that I probably shouldn't have been such a completionist until I beat the game, as you are given opportunities between story missions and even post-ending to finish up anything incomplete.  My advice if you haven't played it yet is to follow the story forward whenever the game will allow you in order for you, the player, to appreciate what you are given to play with.

Just to be clear, the positive aspects of the game, which are huge and very fun, I can't really discuss, so as not to give away surprises.

Summary:
Despite the very annoying shortcomings (mainly because I had very high expectations),  ISS feels like a passable continuation.  I have no regrets about my purchase and still love it.  Sucker Punch produced the most beautiful game for the PS4.  It's very fun when you're not doing the uncreative side missions.  With each story mission, the game continues to elevate right up to the end, as it's predecessors do.  While the journey is not as well constructed as inFamous 2, Second Son is certainly the biggest inFamous game with the most options and choices for your main character.  I highly recommend it and still feel that it made the PS4 a worthwhile purchase.  I look forward to the next inFamous installment and will be pre-ordering that as well in whatever the collector's edition is available.  Currently, inFamous 2 still holds the champion title.",Makes PS4 worth buying,1395360000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
3.0,False,"11 16, 2007",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000P297F2,Tsanche,"The Resident Evil games outside of the main series haven't really done too well.  Especially the first person shooter ones such as Resident Evil: Survivor or Resident Evil: Dead Aim.  And they performed poorly with good reason.  It's nice to say that Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles isn't bad, but it would've been so much better to say it was good.

Umbrella Chronicles is not entirely a new game.  It only serves to show you the downfall of Umbrella.  You'll play through Resident Evil 0, Resident Evil 1 and Resident Evil 3.  Originally, I said it was a shame that Resident Evil 2 was not included in the package.  Well, since the original review was written, Darkside Chronicles came out and it does include Resident Evil 2.  You're getting quite an adventure and a nice trip down memory lane.  A lot of the game is narrated nicely by Albert Wesker as you plow through the game.

You'll have your stock of weapons and ammunition as you go through the game.  Your standard handgun has infinite ammo and can be used to take down most of your basic enemies.  You'll also pick up other weapons which do have ammunition in limited supply.  Most enemies can be taken down quite easily.  Every enemy also has a weak spot you can shoot that results in a one-hit kill.  Unfortunately, it's not easy to hit these spots.

Like the Wii Edition of Resident Evil 4, Umbrella Chronicles feels natural for the Wii. It's no problem getting acquainted to the controls.  You can look around a little with the nunchuck, and you'll use the wii remote to aim and shoot at your foes.  The game is also compatible with the wii zapper.  In addition to blasting your enemies you'll also be able to use your knife by swinging the wii remote.  In short, Umbrella Chronicles is easy to pick up and play.  The overall adventure isn't too hard either.

You'll have some fun with the game because its really simple stuff, but it feels a lot like the House of the Dead arcade shooters.  In a sense, it feels very empty at times.  You have enemies coming at you left and right, but the gameplay eventually turns into something repetitive.  Throughout the adventure it just feels like something more could've been done with the game.  More variety in the gameplay would've been nice.  It's fun at first but there's just not enough thrown at you.  There are moments where you're reflexes will be tested and you'll have to shake the wii remote or press certain buttons.  This'll keep you on your toes, but it's still not enough to drive past the fact that the game grows repetitive really fast.

Perhaps the most striking aspect of Umbrella Chronicles is that it simply could've been a better looking game.  The environments have the look of Resident Evil, but the textures are not all that smooth.  It doesn't look bad, but it certainly needed a bit of a polish to make it look better.

The music is a little strange.  It's this aspect that doesn't make the game feel like Resident Evil.  The music doesn't carry that eerie tone.  It's not bad, though.  For the most part it has a good soundtrack but you can't help but think that you're playing a game that looks like Resident Evil but feels like something else.

Umbrella Chronicles isn't a bad game by any means.  But it sure isn't good either.  Die-hard Resident Evil fans might like it, but it would probably be better to wait until the list price comes down for a game that would've fared better in the arcade rather than the home console.

+Relive some of the best moments of the Resident Evil series

My Lachesis has never worked 100%. Even after installing the most up to date drivers and firmware, the pointer will still skip up to the top of the screen. It seems to happen a lot when im using my right mouse button to move my game camera around.

The programibility and macro functions of this mouse are on par with any other gaming mouse, so nothing special there.

Ergonomics:

This mouse takes a while to get use to, the way you grip it is different then a typical mouse. Its by no means superior to a normal shaped mouse, and so the steep learning curve (many days) is truely a negative.

The button placement on the right side are such that they are next to useless.

Ease of use:

Out of the box you must go online to update the firmware/drivers.

You must make sure your mouse pad remains clean from lint and hair as this affects this mouse more so then other mice.

Conclusion:

Look im not saying this mouse is a useless piece of junk. What I am saying is this mouse was a huge waste of money.

Sound drivers I've tried for Razor, Steel series, and Creative tend to be low-sensitive, and thus bass heavy. These Stealth 450 has impressive polished sound appropriate for pleasant music and movie listening. The sound is precise and instruments get their due spotlight. Nothing mushy or muffled. When it comes to music, the 450 will blow away most gaming headset drivers. It will still project those enemy footsteps and precise sound spacing for high, middle, and low height sounds. Proximity sound feels precise, too.

The material and design is great for long sessions, providing a comfortable yet lightweight gaming headset. The fit is a bit tighter than what I am used to. By no means is it tight, but it's a big snug. It naturally has some tension to keep these wireless puppies at bay. Leatherette or synthetic leather would be a nice touch, but is not the ideal material for a gaming headset. The mesh layered cushion is perfect for long gaming sessions - breathable, durable, and comfortable.

Button layout is excellent. All of the action is on the right speaker. Power button is on the rear speaker (hold down the Turtle Beach triangle power button), there are two dials - one for the volume and one for the mic monitoring volume, there is a 3.5mm input for the cable and a button to choose different mode presets.

I didn't find any software for this headset. I would like some customizing options, but it's no big deal. Out of the box, it's ready to go. Just plug in the microphone.

15 hours of rechargeable battery is a bit of a stretch. From my habits, I've been able to get at LEAST 10 hours of full flight gaming/movie watching before the slightly annoying ""battery low"" messages echo my ears. I think it depends on your usage, much like a car. I usually leave the volume at about 30% (very rough estimate). I seem to get better mileage from gaming versus movie watching. The use of both audio and microphone transmission is my best bet. So if you're about to get into a one hour CSGO competitive match, I highly suggest recharging before doing so. On the plus side, if the batteries do die, you can still use the headset while it's charging. I have a cable ready nearby in case of emergency.

The 450s possess excellent sound drivers for gaming AND multimedia, comfortable, good mic, and wireless capability makes this a top 5 option to consider in the wireless sector. The build doesn't scream luxurious style (see Siberia Elite and Creative EVO), but has an excellent polished and tune sound. My analogy for this headset would be like a hybrid mid size vehicle without all the bells and whistles.

P.S. Some gaming headsets I've tested - Creative Wrath, Fury, Rage, Fatality; Razer Electra, Plantronics 780, Siberia Elite, Corsair 1500, Logitech G35. I'd be glad to provide details for any of these.

Update 08.28.2016

So this is still my main gaming headset and I've moved onto Overwatch. There are a ton of sounds and nuances in that game, so predictably, the battery life went down a bit. I've been getting about 8-9 hours now with ~30% volume and frequent use of the microphone. Hopefully I won't need to perform surgery and replace the internal batteries (I am assuming they are regular rechargeable AA batteries).

Still super lightweight and comfortable for long sessions (2-3 hours).

Throughout the campaign, you will amass an arenal of leathal firearms and expand your transportation with a plethora of performace cars, heavy freight trucks and fire engines as well as motercycles capable of reaching relative speeds in excess of 185 mph (provided you don't meet your fate in a head on collision with a dumptruck).
Firstly, I want to give praise to the designers behind the vehicle performace engine.  Each car is unique with its own areas of high performance and limitations.  Accelleration and braking are handled in a realistic manner and with the handbrake (controlled with (B) on Xbox) you can now drift around hairpin turns with ease.  Just try and avoid the newstand.  Your car will never run out of gas however, when engaging in car battle, be sure to jump into a beefy muscle car or heavy truck unless you want to find yourself downrange of a police blockade or vengful mob of Vicerorys.  NCPs can and will ram/shoot your vehicle until it is disabled.  Carjacking is another option in desperate straits but will often prompt citizens to report you to the authorities which results in a highspeed chase and disaster or escape.  Once you have evaded your pursuers, hop on the freeway and speed out of the district or pull into a back alley garage, kill the lights and wait for them to return to HQ (this takes a little as a few seconds of skimming the streets to several minutes of detail combing of any and every alley way depeding on your current wanted level.  Unfortunatly, you cannot exchange gunfire with agressors from your vehicle but you can raise one of the cities many drawbridges, race over it at the last second, leaving your pursuers to find an alternate route.  Drawbridges are especially thrilling while astride the Sayanora LE, the games fastest and most powerful motercycle.  Boats patrol the waterways of Chicago and don't heistate to jump on board one and make your way out of the city to Lighthouse island or the backwaters of Pawnee.  No, waverunners are not present.
Combat functions like most any shooter game.  LT to aim, RT to fire, all in third person though.  Once you have felled a gunman, don't turn you back just yet, he may get up and keep shooting, especially if he is an armored elite or an Enforcer (hulking juggernaughts best taken out with a grenade launcher or an IED stuck to their back).  Many different firearms are available for purchase at gun shops or you can loot them off you enemies.  Purchse, pick up and fire anything from SMGs to 50 BMG snipers to four shot pump action grenade launchers.  The choices are nearly endless.
Mutiplayer, though fun leaves a bit to be desired.  Options include hiding and hacking other players for noteriety points.

Story: It takes place after Halo 4 basically Master Chief receives a message from an old friend and goes rogue with Blue team. While Spartan Locke and team Osiris is tasked with bringing him back. To avoid spoiling it I won't say anymore but while it has great production values. Great cutscenes, voice acting, and awesome graphics. The game runs at a solid 60 FPS with dynamic resolution. Overall the story reached some high points but also took some missteps which I'll talk about later. It's just not a selling point in this halo which is a disappointment.

Gameplay: Now halo has changed a lot adding new abilities such as ground pound, ADS, thruster packs etc. I didn't like these changes at first but they grew on me and I enjoyed myself a lot. This makes the multiplayer fast but it's still all about precision shots which are still best done from the hip. The abilities aren't overpowered either in fact pretty well balanced. Now in Multiplayer you have Arena (classic halo modes) and 343s new war zone. Arena is at its best and a the shining point in Halo 5. Especially now since Big Team Battle is back and social playlists. Now war zone is okay it can be fun but just pales in comparison to the fun of BTB. Also Halo 5 DLC is all free and it recently just got Forge mode. Overall the multiplayer is great and stable with a decent connection. It's too bad there was so many steps taken backward with this Halo.

Bad Stuff: First off Microtransactions. Halo has a new REQ system that allows you to buy these packs with RANDOM UNLOCKS. Reminds me of destiny which can be frustrating. While they can be earned through multiplayer by REQ points and they can be generous at times it does become a grind. Now the story is short. And Master Chief is only in about 3-4 missions of which there are 15 in total (and some are just interacting sections) Locke and his team are not bad characters but Master Chief is the character that built Halo. Just sucks that there are a lot of steps taken backward.

Final Verdict: There's a lot of stuff that I like about this halo but also a lot that I don't like. While it is a worthy part of the series it's not worth 60$. I'd say wait til this drops to 45$ at most but most likely 35-40$.",Halo takes a lot of steps forward but also many steps back.,1450569600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
5.0,False,"11 1, 2001",AT576Z9DC6HJ0,B00002STVO,D. K. Malone,"I have very fond memories of Panzer Dragoon. It was the first game I bought for my Sega Saturn back in May 1995, meaning it was my first taste of 32 bits. It was such a different time then, because the Sony Playstation hadn't been released yet, and the 16 bit systems were still reigning supreme (Chrono Trigger and Yoshi's Island hadn't even been released yet!) It was a true Clash of the Titans, Nintendo's SNES vs. Sega's Genesis. It was hard to declare a clear winner back then, so the idea of Sega dominating the 32 bit era didn't seem so absurd. I remember seeing a few tiny pics of Panzer Dragoon screens in magazine previews, and that was enough to get me interested, even though I couldn't really see what was going on. When I finally played it, I was completely blown away. Sega's Team Andromeda did an amazing job of creating a unique fantasy world. Well, sort of unique; it was heavily inspired by the manga/anime Nausicaa. As for the game itself, it's a 3D on-rails shooter. It followed in the footsteps of Space Harrier, and Star Fox. The bulk of the simple game play was controlling a cross-hairs and locking onto targets with guided lasers. One feature that was new at the time was the 360' view control. Enemies could attack from any direction, so you had to be quick with the L and R shoulder buttons, swinging the camera around to target whoever the incoming fire is coming from. Another thing that set Panzer Dragoon apart from other shooters was the presentation. It opened with a beautiful cinema, setting the stage for a war and showing just how you come to possess a flying dragon as your steed. It had its own fictitious language, increasing the player immersion. It was a true masterpiece. About a year later, the sequel was released, Panzer Dragoon Zwei. It stayed true to the original, but threw in some new elements and improvements as well. Unfortunately, by the time the third game in the series (Panzer Dragoon Saga) was completed in 1997, the Saturn was already all but dead in the US. The Sony Playstation, which was initially met with a great amount of suspicion and distaste from the gaming community, had become the most successful game console in history and absolutely crushed its competition. Panzer Dragoon Saga came very close to not being released in the US at all, but in the end SEGA saw fit to produce a severely limited run of 6000 copies. It was extremely hard to find. Those who did find it were treated to one of the most enjoyable and unique RPGs ever made. After PDS was released, members Team Andromeda declared that the Panzer Dragoon trilogy was complete, and they disbanded. They went on to work on other projects. One of them was Omega Boost, a 3D shooter for the Playstation that plays almost identically to Panzer Dragoon. [EDIT: Since writing this review I've been told that no one from Team Andromeda worked on Omega Boost] And now, a Playstation 2 game called Rez is on the near horizon. Supposedly there are no less than seven former TA members on the Rez staff, and would you believe it, it too looks to play much like the Panzer Dragoon shooters. Finally, oddly enough, a fourth Panzer Dragoon is on the way to the Xbox. I would have loved another RPG in the series, but apparently this too will be another shooter. Oh well, good enough.

I didn't expect to ramble on this long. If there is anyone out reading this who owns a Saturn but doesn't own the games in the PD series, do yourself a big favor, and get them. All of them. They're well worth it. But get this one first.",A relic from a different time...,1004572800,30,,

I also compared them vs a pair of the popular Sony MDRZX100 headphones that I bought on Amazon for $17 awhile back and appear pretty similar to the Amazon model - they both are around the same pricepoint, they look similar, the earpieces both rotate and lay flat.  I used both the Amazon and the Sony for the same mp3 song as a fair comparison and here are my thoughts:
  -Fit / Comfort: SONY BETTER.  The main reason is the Amazon Basics are just a bit too tight on the old noggin.  I'm an adult male around average height and head size...the Amazon headphones are tight on my noggin and they squeeze my ears a bit.  My kids are elementary school - they told me the Amazon headphones are a bit tight on them.  The Sony's are a very comfortable fit on me and my kids - they are not tight but still stay on well.
  -Sound:  AMAZON WAY BETTER. This is also a matter of personal preference but I did use both the Amazon and Sony headphones to listen to the same song (and same riff paused in the middle). I have layman ears but the Amazon Basics headphones sounded WAY better to me - noticeably fuller sound, more bass.  Some aspect of this is due to sound deadening - the Amazon headphones block out way more outside noise which is a good thing to maximize sound quality - part of this is probably due to the tight squeeze fit (part curse, part blessing).  Even my kids unprovoked commented to me that the Amazon headset blocked outside noise more than they are used to.  By the way, both these sets of On-Ear headphones have way better sound than your average ear bud styles.
  -Build Quality:  SONY BETTER. Both cords and jacks are around same thickness.  But Sony headset made of thicket plastic and feels more durable to me.  On the flipside the Amazon is lighter which can be more comfortable to wear around for some people.
 -Extra Features:  no extra features notable on either model (ie, no tangle free cords, etc).

Overall, these Amazon headphones are a very solid effort.  The sound is amazing for the $15 pricepoint and I give them an overall rating of 4-STARS in consideration of price/value.  I deducted one star for the tight squeeze - maybe in later models they'll tweak the fit or offer an XL version.

The primary problem? It's severely lacking in originality. It both borrows from TS1's Superstar and elements of TS3's Late Night & Ambitions, without really offering anything new. While in theory many people have been clamoring for the return of celeb careers, Late Night really introduced a lot of the elements that Showtime builds on.

The gist, really the CORE, of the game comes from the three new professions that were added - Magician, Singer, and Acrobat. Much like the Ambitions professions, you can follow your Sim 'to work' where they perform at various venues, or if they're just starting out, on the street. When not actively performing gigs (impromptu or scheduled), they can also work on various skills and increase their celebrity level to push their career forward. You do control how they perform at each gig by selecting the sequence of songs / tricks / moves, and there's a small element of responding to the relatively easy-to-please audience's whims, but that's about it. With every level, your sims' performance skills improve. Magicians learn new tricks, singers have new songs & moves, and acrobats have new elements to perform. In addition, you'll unlock new costumes (which can be customized with the new 'Career' Create-A-Sim option) and be less prone to screwing up, and more likely to book bigger and better venues. It's pretty easy to move up the career chain, particularly if you anticipate the skills your sim needs to develop prior to hitting adulthood (ex: working out as a teenager paves the way for a great acrobat career as an adult). And since you're a celeb, you'll also be treated to pretty hefty payouts, with single gigs at big venues netting over $10,000 for just three sim hours of time.

Admittedly the game has come a long way from TS1's Superstar, whose random mini-games were enough to drive you mad. But the gameplay here isn't much different than Ambitions (read: it's repetitive), and you get half the amount of careers to play around with. The only long-term novelty is to try it out with sims of each gender to see slight nuances / differences, but even then that's only six goes through each job.

In addition, the game sort of buggers up what Late Night does, rather than smoothly interacts with it. Suddenly you've got clubs AND venues (the latter of which are nearly impossible to self-create), and no real harmony between them. The sheer number of venues you need in a town are staggering at this point, unless you want to perform at the same handful over & over & over again - the exception being Starlight Shores, your new town, which is jam-packed with venues, but lacking in 'true' nightlife clubs unless you add some new places or update the existing venues with Late Night items. Really, seeing as how Late Night introduced the concept of Celebrity, this game should have been rolled into that one (just like Generations should've been looped in with Pets) if you really wanted to give people a tangible, major addition to their game. Because really? There isn't anything else to comment on.

The decor / clothing is predictably 'lifestyles of the rich & famous' oriented, although a little wackier / more ostentatious than what was rolled out in Late Night. There aren't really many new interactions other than ones related to the new professions. There ARE a lot of classic TS1 / TS2 items that have made a thankful reappearance, including stuff like the gyro-ride, mechanical bull, karaoke machines, and pool tables...all of which really had a place as far back as Late Night. Maybe you *like* the idea of going back and updating all of your Late Night clubs to become venues or updating your Showtime venues to be like nightclubs (there's certainly room) but it's all just a lot of work for the average player I think. There's also the new Simport feature, which has been buggy ahoy and something I've actively avoided, where you can send your sim to another player's town for a 'tour', and if you're thinking this review isn't complete because I didn't include it, *Shrug*. It was never a feature I was craving.

Altogether I'm disappointed with Showtime, as I have been with the last 2 expansions. But to be fair, I wasn't expecting much from the last 2 expansions either. If you're a diehard fan, you'll pick this up anyway. My advice is to wait it out though.

PROS: Great graphics, lots of options to create a wrestler and its entrance.

CONS:

1- HARD AS HELL!: Even on Easy Mode this game is ridiculous hard!, you can spend 20 minutes beating the crap of your opponent and all the sudden they get up all fresh and clean and with 5-6 hits they can beat you.

Table, Ladders, Steel Cage: The concept behind this matches is to weaken your opponent until you can climb the ladder and pick up the title/briefcase, break a table with your opponent or get out of the steel cage.  This 3 are the most difficult tasks in the world!!!! You can perform 3 consecutive finishers to your opponent, and as soon as you start climbing that ladder or steel cage, they get up all fresh and stop you from reaching the top.

2- Best wrestlers not available: You have to buy The Rock!!!! that is ridiculous!, so many great wrestlers like Chris Jerico, Bradshaw, etc and you have to buy them all!!!

3- Pay to wrestle online?!?: If you are paying for an Xbox Live Membership, why would you pay to the WWE to play online?, it doesn't make any sense and is a rip off.

5.0,False,"09 18, 2011",A3QECEWODPD77R,B000FQ2DTA,Joe,"Final Fantasy XIII for the PS3 is one of the best games I've ever played since buying the system. It's filled with beautiful graphics, spot on gameplay, believable and vivid protagonists, and a rather long adventure that will keep you playing for hours on end. (Note; This is spoiler free!)
Pros:
  -The Soundtrack in this game, is by far, some of the best I've ever heard in video game music. I'm a musician myself and I gotta say, if I died and went to heaven, this is the kind of music that you'd only hear angels sing. If your a musician, you should consider getting the game just for the soundtrack itself! A lot of the songs in the game are also very catchy to the point that I find myself humming or whistling the tunes throughout the day. If you really want to get an idea of the soundtrack, look for Lightning's Theme on youtube, you will be blown away!
 -If you like games like Kingdom Hearts, or you've played other Final Fantasy games like FFX or FFX-2, then you'll probably like this game a lot. The characters in the game are so believable with their graphics and voice-acting, I forget that I'm actually playing a game sometimes. The game has tons of cut-scenes, which really enrich the storyline and it constantly adds all kinds of fun or crazy twists. My only gripe with cutscenes, are that I wish they were more interactive like Heavy Rain. It's fun to watch characters in battles do cool things, but it would be even better to execute commands so that you actually feel like you've contributed to the cutscene.
 -Battles in this game are really really fun. They're basically a revamped version of a quick time battle. When walking on the map in the game, enemies don't appear randomly, they're actually already on the map and you have the choice if you want to fight them or not. I think this is a great idea since the players can focus more on the beautiful environments and micro-managing their attributes with ease without walking two steps and entering a battle.
 When battles are started, players have to wait for an attack bar to go up. Once it's up, the character will attack. You can only control one character in battle, and if that specific character gets knocked out, you lose the battle. You also have two allies that help you in battle, healing you if your health is low or helping you kill enemies. In battles, you can't physically move your character; instead, you select an attack option and you watch it play out. One of the things that I liked about battles was that using potions don't affect one character, they fill the health of all three characters! It's extremely helpful, especially when enemies give devastating physical attacks on all three of your characters! It just really saves time! Characters can also ""stagger"" enemies by attacking them enough times, which makes them do more physical damage even when using the most basic attacks. If battles get tough, players can also use Eidoons, which are basically ""summons"" that can do really heavy damage on foes. Overall, battles are really fun in this game. I actually found myself wanting to go into any battle I could because they were so much fun.
 -Developing characters have a new system called a ""crystalarium"". After winning battles, you'll earn something called crystogen points, which you can spend in the crystalarium for new abilities, increased health or magic, and also attack techniques such as Libra, which analyzes enemies to help you figure out their weaknesses. Overall, developing characters is really user-friendly and very easy to use.
  -The game's story involves a lot of switching between protagonists since at some point they do split up. One of the things I really liked was the fact that the characters that you did not play as during one segment still gain experience points when you were not using them. So if you played as one character for one scene, and now you're in a completely new scene as a different character, that new character gets the experience points that you worked your butt off for in battles. It was really helpful, since most of the time the game centered on a group of characters for a while, and to switch back to them with an abundance of experience points was just awesome.
 -Throughout the game, I've never felt ""underprepared"" for battles. Sometimes I would get stuck on certain bosses, but I never got stuck to the point that I had to back off and grind for more experience points. I found this to actually be a really nice advantage since the story in this game is very heavy and engrossing and adding a boss battle that made the player underprepared after putting hours into the game, would be unfair.
  -

Cons:
 -This game is extremely linear. A lot of the maps involve just walking in one direction, with the occasional shortcut that leads to a treasure. The linear factor isn't really a bad thing, it does save time compared to other FF games that take way too long  just to figure out where to go, but these maps could have been spanned out a lot better.
  EDIT: I have completed the game and once you reach about halfway in the game you'll end up in Gran Pulse, which is a huge and open, free explorable world. Although there isn't any towns in Gran Pulse, the linear factor here is completely gone, which I found to be a refreshing twist!
 -There's no explorable towns in this game. I mean, the characters do come across quite a few towns, but because they are fugitives throughout the entire game, town exploration is minimized to none at all. So instead of walking around and looking for stores, players simply shop for items at save points.
  EDIT: Since there's no towns, players can also shop for various weapons, upgrades, and different items at save points as well, which is a huge advantage.
 -You can't save anytime in this game. I mean there is a ton of save points at every corner, but it would've been nice if I could be given the option to save wherever I wanted to, or even quick save like some of the remastered FF games have.
 -If you have more than three characters in your party, you can't switch them out during battles like you could in FFX. These characters simply remain in the pause menu to indicate that they're in your party. It's a shame too, considering how I really wanted some of these characters to fight with me in battles.
  EDIT: Once you hit Gran Pulse, you actually can switch your character battle team around in the game. It's a little disappointing that we finally get that option halfway through the game, but better to have it than not at all!!
  -When you're in battles, there's an option called ""Auto battle"" which allows you to choose the best possible actions that you can choose. While it is extremely helpful, I it would be nice to have the ability to turn that off, or have it removed by the user's choice. That way, fans that have been playing the games for a while can focus more on micro-managing rather than completely relying on the auto attack command.
  -Whenever I played the game, I always felt like I never had enough money to spend on cool items such as accessories or weapons. Battles don't exactly give you too much money, and treasure chests just have other weapons or accessories. So whenever you come across a save point that has a new shop in it, you really don't feel excited or curious about it since you have no money!

Overall-
 Final Fantasy 13 is an epic game. It has an engrossing storyline that extremely in-depth, it has a really fun and simplistic battle system that really keeps you coming back for more, it has characters that are believable and make you sympathize with them, and it has beautiful environments that transform your living room into the world of Cocoon. It's definitely not like any of the older games; it is something that tries to be new and fresh for young and experienced gamers alike, and it definitely achieves it!

Post Game Summary:
  Since I've written this review, it's been a few months and I was actually halfway through the game. I can now gladly say that I have completed Final Fantasy 13. It was truly and amazing experience. From the intro cutscene that feels like a movie, to the final hand sweating boss battle at the very end, this game was most definitely worth my time and money. I will not spoil the ending, but I must say, it is truly deep among any of the Final Fantasy games I've ever played and it's truly something you can only achieve by actually spending the time through this game from start to finish. Just listening to the ending song ""My Hands"" was really emotional and to this day I still think about the game. I can't wait to start playing Final Fantasy 13-2!!

4.0,False,"05 19, 2009",ARNEUO7BF3J55,B001TOQ8K2,David Swan,"Punch-Out!! has to be the one Nintendo game that most needed to be redone. I absolutely cannot understand why the big `N' skipped two whole platforms before releasing a new version. Why wasn't Punch-Out!! ported to the DS? We know it can handle Super NES games. Oh well, Punch-Out!! is finally back and I love it. Let me start by saying that Nintendo didn't screw this one up although I can't say that it felt like 1984 again. The technological leap is pretty dramatic and visually it feels like a whole new experience. On the other hand it takes players back with old school pattern recognition and from a control standpoint it's a near clone of the NES Punch-Out!!

The characters look fantastic but I was a little disappointed by the opponent's intro's that consisted of nothing more than four still images. On the other hand the characters voices are absolutely hilarious. King Hippo has a voice that sounds like a cross between a grunt and a belch. The line-up of fighters is less then what was in the Super NES version but it's still impressive. I might have liked to have seen Pizza Pasta but no lineup short of every character ever made would have been perfect. The only new character is Disco Kid whose is essentially the new Kid Quick. The lack of new characters shows a little failure of imagination on the part of Next Level Games but such is life. Despite any issues I might have this is a game I really did not want to stop playing and that is about as much as I can demand. The sound of glove on face is positively magical and when Glass Joe went down I wanted him back to his feet so I could continue to deliver more punishment. In fact it is the fighting that Next Level Games really nailed. The first time I fought Don Flamenco he cleaned my clock but I stayed with it until I beat him. I never felt frustrated and the success of planting his Spanish rear on the canvas was outstanding.

The opponents in Punch-Out!! move in a predictable pattern but this is definitely to the games benefit. Unlike other fighting games you cannot just mash buttons and win. In games like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and Soul Caliber I could often win early battles with my eyes shut tightly. You can't even beat Glass Joe that way. Punch-Out!! requires steely concentration. There is also a sense of discovery in hunting down fighters weaknesses. Great Tiger was plastering me until I found out then when he leans for an upper cut I need to lean the same direction to avoid his punch and when Bear Hugger tries to hug me I can avoid by ducking down and then giving him a shot to the belly.

Punch-Out!! isn't going to win any innovation awards but what it does is take old fashioned timing and pattern recognition and perfect it. It is essentially the classic Punch-Out!! with a massive facelift. Now if we could just convince Nintendo that Punch-Out!! needs to come out with every new platform life would be just a little bit better. And while Nintendo is at it where is Wave Race for the Wii?",The Mac Attack is Back,1242691200,2,,

The fumbles are a bit much - as I cannot tell you how many times I have fumbled the ball - WHILE I WAS COVERING IT. Plus - the superhuman abilities of the db's and linebackers to jump 6-8 feet in the air to intercept a pass. I always feel like I'm playing against the legion of superheroes - where everyone has a flight ring, except my receivers. I expect an interception if I'm throwing into tight coverage, or double coverage, or a safety gets me on a cover 2. But to see a ball go well over the head of a linebacker on it's way to a receiver that's 20-30 yards away and then to see that linebacker leap into the air like the Hulk - AND catch the ball like I just tossed him an apple - is very frustrating. It works both ways I know - I've had the AI for my defense pick off a pass - and they almost always go back for a touchdown! How many TD interceptions do you normally see in a game? Not 2-3 per team each game... hopefully they will come out with a patch!

5.0,False,"07 19, 2005",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B0007U0GTI,Lisa Shea,"I'm a big fan of the Puyo Pop series. It's like Tetris with a twist - instead of falling squares, you have falling Puyos, little critters with wiggly eyes!

The basic idea is that you are playing ""tetris"" head to head against an enemy. You both get the exact same falling colors, and have to connect them into chains to make them vanish and score points. If you create large chains, you get to drop clear Puyos down on your enemy, making their life more difficult. Whoever forces the other to fill up their screen first, wins.

In addition to this basic Tetris-like play, there is an additional Fever mode. If you rack up a nice series of chains, your screen goes into an ""overtime"" mode. You are presented with a set situation - a layout of blocks. A single duo falls from the sky. It's like a puzzle. If you figure out exactly the right spot to put it, you create a chain reaction that clears out everything and earns you yet another Fever scenario. You can really do a number on your opponent if you think quickly!

The single play is relatively short - there are three sets of scenarios. The training mode has 3 levels, while the other ones have 8 levels. However, there are the traditional continuous modes, and then of course the wireless DS head to head style play with up to 7 other players. If you're into puzzle games, you can see how this would become endlessly addictive!

The graphics are much nicer than previous handheld versions of Puyo Pop. We were addicted to our N-Gage version for quite a while, for example. In this DS version you can clearly see the little eyes and how each color has its own personality - the reds are angry, the greens are bug-eyed. On the other hand, I really miss the sound from the N-Gage. The songs on this DS version are a little to techno-pop for me.

Also on the annoying side is the girl in the ""plot"". Of course the plot is completely meaningless - it involves a girl who is going to magic school and somehow has to do these Puyo contests as part of her life. She is a true Valley Girl shouting out things like ""Wicked!"" in a silly voice. Luckily that skip button is ever present and lets you skip on to the actual gameplay.

Skylar,"I was originally excited about the PSP Go when I first heard of it; I thought it could be a great portable console like the PSP had been for me. PSP despite some early criticism got better and had some cool features and some good games that made it worth it for me. I thought I could expect something great right away from the new version, the Go, Boy was I wrong.

On the positive side the Go looks great and feels great, it is much lighter than the original PSP and a little lighter than the 3000 version. I like how it slides, its size, games play nicely with the controls and I think it's comfortable.  The screen is smaller than that of the PSP but looks really good. You can change the internal memory to that of a 32 GB and I'm sure eventually you will be able to buy even more memory. The fact that you can buy the games online and get them on your Go is nice (but it takes too long! waiting 30 mins-1 hour for the PS store to PSP Go is painful!). You can also upload videos and music which is great (wait couldn't the PSP already do these last two features?). ""Mini"" games don't cost much and are fun. It definitely has a lot of potential to it.

Nothing really justifies how it can be priced higher than the PSP. It has 16 GB internal memory which is not bad but what If I want to keep all the games I buy on it? I have to delete some of the ones I already have and then if I ever want to play them again I need to repurchase them? Or how about buying games and not being able to know if they're any good? The fact that PSP Go games that you don't physically own cost more or as much as a PSP game when it really shouldn't is a turn-off.  You can't exchange or sell the game either which is not a good thing as of now, if you don't like a game you buy at least you can get something for it even if it is minimal, with the Go forget it! You paid enough for the system and now you have to buy downloads for 40$ (there are ""mini"" games which you can buy for 5-10$ and some are really fun but it's an entirely different thing than a big game)? Also the Go doesn't have as good of an infrastructure as Sony would want you to think, it is likely to get better but for now it doesn't offer a lot and  there aren't that much games available. You can get some PSP titles which is good but with the PSP library of games you'd think there would be more available, it isn't the case yet but they released some big ones like God of War and newer PSP games are available on the Go.  I was also disappointed in the fact that it isn't compatible with PSP games and UMDs, when  a new game system comes out I think the ones buying it have come to expect this from consoles who have retro compatibility ( Wii, PS3, PS2, Xbox 360 and even the DS ) so why not the Go? Having a new console is nice but it doesn't mean throw away the previous one just yet! The battery is not replaceable in the sense that you can't remove it or replace it yourself which is unfortunate if you ever come to experience problems with it.

I would keep my PSP for now instead of buying a Go. I'm not saying the Go will never be worth it but for now it's not unless you know you really want one or if have the money to experiment with or risk. I've owned a PSP since 2005 and still enjoy it and I don't see why you would NEED to switch to Go yet. Besides Sony has stated that the Go was not meant to replace the 3000 and that they would continue its support. Perhaps just like every console it's too pricey for a launch but this one really is, it doesn't cost a lot less than a PS3 (50$ approximately)! You can still buy and play games on a PSP, download stuff and it doesn't cost as much.  I'm not a hater, I like what it CAN do and the system itself is great but when it all comes down to the thing that is price, then it's too expensive overall.  For now if you're buying your first PSP get a 3000 (or maybe older) it won't be as frustrating and it's probably best for now as the PSP is still a good portable console.",Go or stay?,1263686400,2,{'Color:': ' Piano Black'},

4.0,False,"08 20, 2008",APVK8GGSSUDCE,B0017U08X6,Amazon Customer,"Disclaimer and Background:  I've played SC 2 and 3 at the arcades, and only have SC2 for the PS2, so obviously, SC4 was going to be substantially superior graphically.  I also can't compare any games from SC4 versus SC3, since again, I've only played the arcade version of SC3.

Additionally, I'm sure a bunch of people have already reviewed the actual game, so I'll focus instead on the Premium Edition content.

You get the game (of course), the Tshirt, a code for in game material, and the ""book"".  Oh, and some ""tournament bracket card"", and the metal case. Here's a breakdown of the extras:

1. Tshirt:  Pretty good quality shirt, I've washed it a few times and looks good so far.  The silk screen isn't very sharp, though, it's as if you're comparing a bootleg concert Tshirt to a real thing.  The picture's there, but it's not high resolution.  But at least it wasn't 50/50 cotton/polyester like the real crappy Tshirts.  My son liked it, but since he's only 9 years old, I figured that Dad will wear it instead.

2. Code for in-game material:  Very straightforward instructions for entering the code in the Playstation network (internet connection required, of course).  It didn't exactly specify what was given, and I didn't bother to go through each character model to look for them, but if you're a completist and need every available costume and look, well, there you go!

3. ""Art Book"":  As another reviewer said, this one's a negative.  The picture shown in Amazon shows a hardcover book, and it's supposed to be an Art Book, according to the description, but it's only half that.  The first half of the book is a short, but decent, comic, about SC, and introduces a couple new characters you'll find in the game (no, not Darth Vader).  Basically, if you got a regular cheap comic (since it's black and white), and shrunk it down to the size of 7 by 5, that's the first half of this ""art book"".  The second half does indeed have some drawings of SOME of the characters.  I would have thought that they would have at least included pics of all characters, but oh, well.

4. Tournament bracket card:  I've never been to a SC tournament, so I have no idea if this is a replica or if there's any significance.  Just a plastic card, no use for me.

5. Metal box:  Nice, everything fits into it, its closure snaps okay.  You can probably use it as a candy dish or something.

Overall:  Is this a good package?  Yes.  Is it worth the extra 20 bucks?  I would say so, the Tshirt by itself is mostly worth it, the comic/art book is worth 2 bucks, and the case, additional content (costumes) and that nifty card is just extra dressing.

I'd recommend this Edition over the regular edition, especially if any of the extra items are things you'd care for.  If not, you're not losing out too much by buying the regular edition.  Either way, I'd get the game, though, because graphically, the game is very good.  Cutscenes are also good, and the stories are okay.","Great Game, OK Bundle",1219190400,10,"{'Edition:': ' Premium', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

They are completely wrong. I wish people would stop comparing awesome titles such as Darksiders to games that have somewhat similar mechanics.

This game is NOT GoW or Zelda, nor does it feel like either. God of War is God of War. Zelda is Zelda. And Darksiders is Darksiders! It's really fun and awesome to look at. Really smooth controls when it comes to fluidity, and HUGE bosses that make you think, ""oh damn, there's no way I can kill this guy!"" I love it. It feels like you're playing an animated comic book. A very BRUTAL comic book.

It has a perfect blend of cartooniness vs realism. Not too much of either. A game that is developed to be ""real life like"" in it's entirety is horrible. Because in real life, if you get shot once you're dead(most of the time). And a game that's too cartoony feels like you're playing pokemon. Darksiders has the perfect balance of both.

There's plenty of upgrades for weapons, an awesome story, and alot of all around enemy mutilation as well as really satisfying combos that are not too hard to execute. Just because it happens to be a hack n slash does NOT mean that it is a GoW copy. This game is it's own game. (Don't take me wrong, I love GoW to death).

I'm actually extremely happy to finally have a game that isn't another FPS. It seems that most games developers want to release these days are FPS games. (can't wait for Dante's Inferno too).

If you're a fan of hack n slash games with a perfectly blended amount of intriguing puzzles here and there, & a great story then Darksiders will satisy your needs. It IS NOT a rip off of any other game, and anyone that says so needs to ease up on their analyiticalism and just enjoy a great game for what it is instead of comparing it to everything else.

First, the CE items: I love all of them except for the arm band. I can appreciate what they were trying to do when they decided to include it, but it's too cheesy, too bulky, and it isn't something that I think belongs on display or in practical use. Otherwise, I loved everything else: the art book, the poster, the season pass (if you enjoy the game, this is great to have), and the watch is okay. I did a YouTube video of me unboxing the CE. Amazon deleted the link, though.

The watch looks good, but you get what you pay for. The CE (or the Sleeper Agent Edition) was $159.96 when I bought it. You are paying $59.99 for the base game. I would think that the art book would be worth about $20. So, now you're up to $79.99 in value (or $80 to be easy). The poster would be worth about $5; so, that's now about $85. The season pass is going for about $40. Now, we're up to $125 of value in this The Division Collector's Edition. Plus, there was about $15 worth (in my estimation) of DLC items included - skins, weapons, etc. So, that's about a $140 value so far. That means that there's about $20 worth of value left unaccounted for. That's essentially what you're paying for this watch, and that's essentially the quality you're getting in that watch. The physical design is cool. It's made out of a hard metal-like material (the texturing is odd...not quite metal, but not plastic or rubber, either). It has a nice weight to it; but, the time only shows when you hit a button and the orange ring light only turns on when you hit that same button. As far as features on the watch, they are very standard: time, date, and a stopwatch.

Lastly, the game:

I won't go into too much detail about it (because there really is soooo much that could be said about both the good and bad), but initially, I really LOVED this game. However, it was and seems to continue to be absolutely plagued with bugs, glitches, and too many opportunities for those inclined to take advantage of unintentionally broken mechanics. I pretty much hate the DZ - even when I've gone in there with a group and were doing more killing than being killed, it's just not fun to me. (Obviously, this is simply my opinion. There are those that really enjoy the DZ.) To me, it seems that the DZ is balanced too much in favor of those going rogue. There doesn't really seem to be any down side to going rogue. Yes, there is an increase in experience points lost if you die while rogue, but the benefits and experience gains while rogue far outweigh the costs of dying rogue. The story missions and side missions were fun enough for a while. It is definitely more fun when you're with a group of people you are familiar with and game with regularly.

The incursions weren't very well thought out, in my opinion. As a matter of fact, I haven't even downloaded any of the Season Pass expansions that I have already paid for because the game lost me after Falcon Lost. The combination of how unimaginative Falcon Lost was, with the bugs and glitches, and the lack of fun I was having in the DZ, I decided to cut my losses and let it go.

I love the idea of the Division. I bought into the back story companion, called New York Collapse (which was fantastic!), and I bought t-shirts, and a coffee mug from the official Ubisoft store. I love the fact that they are going to make a movie about it. It's just the execution of the game was really poor. I honestly wouldn't recommend anyone spend money on the game - certainly not the Collector's Edition. It was money that was not well spent for me.","I love the idea of The Division, but...",1470441600,,,

4.0,True,"04 23, 2013",AOUWC6SSSG42I,B006W41W3M,Mike Pettit,"My previous gaming headset of choice was the Turtle Beach X12. I bought a pair of X12 about two years ago and have not once regretted them. I just got tired of the cord getting in the way, and I wanted to see what else TB had to offer.

After carefully reading many of the reviews on Amazon and other sites, I decided on the X42. It seemed like a step up in every way: X12 are wired stereo, X42 are wireless surround sound. The X42 are double the price, but I was willing to swing it.

Upon first unboxing the X42, I was a little overwhelmed. Since I have no experience with surround sound, it seemed like there was a lot to learn. The manual is definitely helpful here. Also, make sure you consult online instructions to pair your TBs, because the in-box directions are actually incorrect.

Continually, anyone moving up from the X12 will notice that the X42 ear cups are circular, rather than oblong, which means your ears probably won't fit quite so neatly. I have a rather massive head and it took some time for me to find an adjustment I liked, especially because of my glasses and long hair, which also complicated the fitting process.

Once my X42 was powered-up and paired, I popped in Fallout 3 on PS3 for a test run (the X42 will work as surround sound headphones for any console with an optical audio output). The difference is quite astounding, but then again I have sensitive ears. If you're the kind of person who cant tell a 128 kbps song from a 1,280 kbps song, the X42 will probably do nothing for you.

The X42 are definitely a step up in sound quality. Mine needed some burn-in time before they sounded quite right. After an hour or two, the sound was punchy and sharp, with responsive highs, lows, and mids. Since my gaming room is right next to my laundry room, which also houses my furnace, it's imperative that I have gaming headphones to block out the extra sound. The X42 mask background noise quite nicely. I had fun messing around with the surround angles and the sound equalizers (Bass Boost, Treble Boost, Bass + Treble Boost).

Trench warfare with yellow Super Mutants never sounded so good. I began to notice things I had never caught before  certain subtleties in the audio mixing. For instance, I noticed that firing my Assault Rifle sent shells showering to the ground. Computer Terminals emit a certain hum when accessed. I could also hear enemies sneaking up on me from behind.

On the other hand, while the X42 are an improvement in sound quality, the build quality is roughly the same as the X12. In fact, as far as form is concerned, I actually prefer the shape and comfort of the X12 to that of the X42. The volume adjustment knob on the X12 is more convenient, and the headphones are just easier to adjust. There is also less hassle for setup. Also, do yourself a favor and pick up some rechargeable AAA batteries. You will definitely need them.

If you're looking for a solid headset, buy the X12. They will do you no wrong as a step above the standard headset. If you really want the most out of your game sound, I would recommend X42 or even a pricier model. They really bring the audio to life. Truth be told, most plebs won't be able to tell the difference between enhanced stereo and 5.1 surround sound, so start small and work your way up if you aren't sure, or maybe demo them in-store if possible.","Better sound than X12, but not better build quality.",1366675200,,{'Edition:': ' Surround Sound'},

He owns a pair of Classic FPSFREEK's and I didn't like the feel of the thumbstick being so raised. They do take a few hours (or rounds) of playing with to get use to but after that I was hooked. I didn't realize there were so many different types of KontrolFreek sticks so I did a little research and like what I heard about the VIPR sticks. I play a lot of Battlefield 3 online as well as some multiplayer and zombies on COD Black Ops 2 along with other FPS games. Anyways I got 'em in the mail (they ship quick too) snapped 'em on effortlessly and started playing. I fell in love right away. Fine tune adjustments to aiming down the sights was instantly noticed as was controlling air vehicles in BF3. As I said they do take a little bit to get use to but afterwards, you'll wonder how you ever played without as I did. Now I want them all (there are different sticks for CQC (Close Quarters Combat, shorter stick), Sniping (longer stick), racing (cupped stick)  etc..) just to see and feel the difference, plus they actually improved my online scoring (not a guarantee but they did for me) The bumpy grip texture on the top of the sticks are great, they're super easy to install (just snap on top of the controller thumbstick) they stay put, I even mashed up down left and right a few times just to check. I do currently only use my VIPR stick on my controllers right thumbstick as I don't really need one on the left (you can put them on both if you'd like, totally preference. They send 2 in a pack) so I just keep one for backup. That's the other thing, they are sturdy and well made.

Many things are refined and polished, and you can tell the developers worked hard on the game. Lots of weapons, huge map, some new interesting mechanics. Michael Bay would be proud.

CONS: It might be a little TOO similar to the previous game. Constant respawns at bases are a pretty big annoyance, just as the last game. Story is generic and non-sensical, although anyone familiar with the franchise will go into it expecting this.

As fun as this game's mechanics can be, it's really just a playground. There's little depth to the game, little narrative reason to actually DO anything in the game, especially a map this size. It's daunting. Fans of the series will no doubt take little issue with this, since Just Cause has always been just about blowing stuff up -- however, for newcomers looking for another open-world series to get into, I would look elsewhere.","Fun mechanics, but little depth.",1469491200,,{'Format:': ' Software Download'},

The initial concept is interesting and the gameplay, especially when your character's powers reach a godlike magnitude, can be fun. However, none of that adds up to a game worth the value of the box it comes in.
First off, the game is not finished. Ever played KOTOR 2? Hated the fact that the ending seemed rushed and unfinished? Not only is this ending even less polished; it cuts off on purpose. Without the phantom sequels to fill in the plot holes, this is a terrifically weak story, something I'm frankly surprised an author like Card would be willing to put his name on. The characters are ill-defined and not particularly interesting or charming. The game makes vague references to Card's books, but neither attempts to explain the setting to non-fans nor explain what has happened between the books and Advent Rising (for instance, why does the destruction of Edumea bring the human race near extinction? What happened to all the other planets colonized by humanity?). The plot that does exist in the game is bare-bones. For example, at one point a bounty hunter is sent after main character Gideon Wyeth, and says that he'd been hoping to capture him alive. Why? Who wants him alive and what do they want him for? Perhaps these questions were meant to be answered in the sequels that will likely never come out. If so, it's a pretty flimsy excuse, and not a very good way to endear yourself to your audience... unless there is a large audience of people who like paying for a full story in a number of full-priced installments.
If you are one of those people, you will be disappointed because unless things change quite a bit, you aren't going to be able to get the rest of the series for love or money. And if you aren't, you'll be as bitterly disappointed as I was.",What was Orson Scott Card thinking?,1200787200,,,

The game takes place in London, England in the year 2038.  Demons from Hell have taken over London and they live above ground.  The last remmants of humanity live underground in subway stations.  The levels you go through are always different and the monsters and creatures you fight against are always different.

Right now, I'm playing a character called Blademaster and I'm having so much fun playing that character.  You can play six different characters in the game.  You actually give your character a name and you make your character look the way you want it to look before you start playing the game.  Blademaster is an expert using different swords and shields.  You can also use one sword in each hand or a pistol in one hand and a sword in the other hand.  You can also use a grappling hook to bring a demon next to you with one hand and kill the creature with a sword with the other hand.  You make the choice of how to fight the demons throughout the game.

It was so cool to fight against demons called Blood Zombies and I actually used my sword to cut one Blood Zombie right in half.  Well the bottom half of the Blood Zombie's body kept coming at me.  It was just the hips and the legs coming after me.  I couldn't believe it.  Another time I chopped off the head to a Blood Zombie and the body kept coming after me with no head attached.  There are these jumping demons that look like mean looking dogs and they will try to land on top of you.  Well I actually use my sword to kill them while they are up in the air above me.  It so cool to see them fall down dead around you.

The graphics in this game are really good.  I don't why people are saying the graphics aren't very good in other reviews because I think they're great.  Also the demo to the game is only 5% of the full game.  The different levels and demons in the demo are nothing compared to what is in the full version game. The full version game is huge.  The game reminds me a lot of Diablo and Diablo II.  I loved those games and I love this game.  This game is definitely a five star game.  I highly recommend getting this game.

5.0,False,"04 7, 2006",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000E0OCR8,Tsanche,"This is a revelation for the Jak and Daxter series, as well as the PSP.  It's Daxter getting his own title, and it's a game for the PSP that overall sets the bar on many standards.  Simply put, this is one of the best PSP titles ever to emerge, and it's a fantastic game.

Before Jak II, Daxter had an adventure of his own.  One where he protected the citizens of Haven City from bugs.  That's right, bugs, and to show for it, his main weapon is an electric flyswatter.  The story is simplistic, but that doesn't mean the game losses edge or momentum.  The game still maintains its humor, in this title even more so than before.

The mission based system is not really any different than Jak II or Jak 3.  If you've played those two titles, you'll be right at home with Daxter, as the set up isn't much different.  Each mission consists of a primary objective that you'll have to complete.  Usually they're killing enemies or destroying a hive or something to the effect.  The secondary objectives in each mission are optional, and they're reminiscent of Jak and Daxter titles.  You'll be collecting metal bugs and/or precursor orbs in secondary mission objectives.  You only have to complete the primary objective to move on and advance the story.  You can always comeback and do those secondary objectives later, and sometimes that may be better.  You'll have better equipment by then usually.  The game actually works in a way that you probably will end up coming back to a level with better equipment to get these things.

As you go through these levels you'll be using either Daxter's flyswatter or an insecticide spray.  Both are fun to use.  His sprayer even gets upgrades as levels progress, which is pretty neat.  Daxter can do many different sorts of things in each level as well.  He's got a double jump, he can climb certain walls, and he can even use his sprayer as a hover device.  The gameplay mechanics are fluent and precise.

The gameplay doesn't stop there either.  Throughout some levels, Daxter will find himself having to do a multitude of things.  Jump from moving trains and platforms, finding a ""zoomer"" that will allow him to catch up with certain enemies and much more.  There are also plenty of mini-game sequences that tend to borrow from movies.  Not much in the gameplay is original, but to be honest, it isn't about original gameplay, it's about how well you get it to work.  Daxter gets the gameplay working extremely well.  The elements are perfectly balanced.  The gameplay never lets up, and it's always fun to play.  You'll always be glad to come back to this game.  The gameplay is never stale, either.

The only two elements that seem to bog this game down are the learning curve and camera angles.  The control schemes takes a moment to get used to.  Once you do, however, the game becomes very fluent.  The camera needs work, but it still works and doesn't detract from the gameplay really.

There's also a multiplayer game.  A bug combat game.  Throughout your adventure you'll find lots of different items and goodies that you'll be able to use in bug combat.  Bug combat is a neat mini game that allows you to send your bug into battle and battle against either the computer or a friend.  It works out very well.  There is no point to the bug combat, but it does make for a nice relaxing break from the main game.

The most obvious thing about Daxter are the graphics.  This is by far the best looking game on the PSP.  This really shows how graphically powerful the PSP is.  No framerate issues, everything looks stellar, vibrant and colorful.  This game shows what means to be walking around with a PS2 in your pocket.  The sound is also very good and fluent.  One of the best sounding games on the PSP as well.  The voice acting, needless to say, is top-notch.  Of the best in the gaming world.

Simply put, this is one of the best games ever to hit the PSP.  As far as I'm concerned, this has set the standard for platforming PSP games to come.  Graphically it's the best PSP game out there, and gameplay wise, nothing comes close on the PSP.  Daxter sets the bar for what a stellar PSP game should be.

The Good

+OUTSTANDING Presentation!  The graphics are without a doubt, THE BEST on the PSP.

+The Gameplay is without a doubt the best on the PSP.  It never gets stale, repetative or boring.

+Outstanding voice acting

+Plenty of extra minigames and collecting

+Fluent controls

The Bad

-The camera lacks in some areas

-While the controls are fluent, they'll take time to get used to

I like how Factor 5 dared to be different this time around. You get to play as an AT-ST walker and direct Ewoks to trigger their traps on Endor. You also get to relive the famous speeder bike chase, and thanks to some truly stunning graphics this scene is just as cool as it was in the movie. In fact a lot of this game covers sequences that the previous installment, Rogue Leader, didn't cover. If you put the two games together you pretty much get a complete Star Wars Trilogy package.

The flight missions are still top-notch. The Jedi Starfighter makes a cameo this time around, and you get to drop those cool seismic charges like in the movie. The on-foot missions though, are somewhat problematic. You can run around and blast Stormtroopers, but the controls feel a bit loose and the aiming reticle doesn't always latch onto the person you want to shoot at. Jumping can become a royal pain, especially in the Dagobah and Sail Barge missions. Overall these missions are playable, but their unrefined qualities make them too easy compared to the flight and vehicle missions, and they work mostly as a mild diversion.

We also get a bunch of bonus content in Rebel Strike. ALL of Rogue Squadron is available in 2-player co-op mode, and I'm surprised Factor 5 managed to squeeze it all in. There are dvd bonuses like art galleries, a making-of, and even audio commentary. There's also the 80s Star Wars arcade games wrapped in a funky disco-themed menu. Overall while the on-foot missions have flaws, there's a ton of fun and value in the package that can't be overlooked.

If you are thinking of getting these, you might be better off trading in your controller to gamestop or selling to a friend and just buying a new one. It would equal out the cost of constantly buying these things.

The grips pictured have 10 little bumps around the rim. The ones I received have only 8. While this may not matter to some, I thought it was weird. I technically did not get the item pictured. Did not seem to impact performance.

By the way, I tried them on PS3, Xbox 360, and Xbox One controllers. They -Do Not- fit the Xbox One controller at all. The diameter of the top of the Xbox One thumbstick is much smaller than the 360, so the grip slides all over the place and even falls off completely.

They fit the PS3 controller very well, but were difficult to get on. You can clearly see from the design that they are intended to mimic 360 remote and are concave. Because the PS3 control stick tops are convex, they make for a super snug fit. I'd say they work the best on the PS3 controller.","Do NOT buy these for Xbox One. Okay on 360.

Oddessy, the Illiad, the journeys of Odin, the legends of Osiris, Jason and the Argonauts and so forth, and as many big media productions (movies, video games, TV shows and so forth,) as have tried to get it right, this is the first one that actually does.  Now, I love this sort of thing, just BECAUSE the basic concepts are older than my whole family, but if you are easily bored by concepts or if you simply hate the idea of mythical Gods and monsters (why would you,) this game is probably not for you, because that's where most of its charm lies.  After all, its voices, gaming engine and level editor are far less substantial than, say, Warcraft 3, but if you want the Gods and Monsters, this is the place to go.  And as much as I loved the original legends, they were never brought to life for me like this.
That having been said, let's get to the hard data...
The graphics are excellent, but unfortunately, you only get to realize this in the cutscenes, because in mid-game, you zoom out on the characters, and unlike in Warcraft 3, you can't zoom in or look at things from the side.  Also, the voices in this game are slightly inferior to the Warcraft 3 ones, and the facial expressions exist almost not at all.
The level editor of this game, though it exists, prohibits the gamer from doing a great many things that Warcraft 3's World Editor allows, such as setting up specific victory conditions and so forth.
But this game has a few things that favor it over Warcraft.  The first is the more realistic character proportions, and the second is the fact that it's myth, darn it!  That's just awesome!
Another thing this game has to speak for it is the fact that one can gather resources from a variety of sources instead of just one type of tree, one type of plant, etc...  This is a trait shared in Age of Empires.
The storyline links together a number of famous myths using a much larger concept and a much larger threat than any of those myths involved originally.
And lastly, although it takes the music of the game a while to loop, that music is repeated almost every level, so it might get annoying.

Parker,"I got the original Nintendo ds as an xmas gift in the 2004 new year 2005 season, and I have to say I am pretty impressed by the overall quality of the system. This Nintendo ds is the Silver platinum color scheme which is the first color at the time. I've dropped this thing a billion times and even spilled water on it and it works flawlessly. That's the thing you can always expect from Nintendo is quality and durability. I've never had a nintendo system fail on me from the n64 to gbc to gba to gcn whatever. Unless your actually trying to break it its not goin to break. I don't know if anybody else has had this problem, but my L and R shoulder buttons just don't work anymore. I have no idea why but they just don't work. That is the only problem i have right now. It frustrated me because they died after the warranty expiration date. The ds also has wireless multiplayer gaming with one card with some games and a pictochat mode, gba slot. Sadly no gbc games or gameboy games can be played which is a huge dissapointment. The multiplayer with gba games doesn't work either due to the abcence of the multi link cable port missing. Overall a pretty good system, very durable. I do realize that there are ds lites, and the dsi, and the dsi xl but to me its not worth it. I hardly ever use the ds and theres no incentive for me to buy a remake. Thats the critical problem with the ds is the gimmicky rediculous games it has. I have 3 games that I enjoy playing on this thing. That's why I'm rating it as 3 stars. I mean if your a parent who has kids in the 4-9 year old range it will satisfy them and will probably be a good buy. Im a freshman in college and I require more entertainment in my games. Brain age and brain age two and nintendogs just don't satisfy my needs. Theres three games that I love to play, Super mario 64 ds, mario kart ds, and new super mario bros. thats about it on the games library in my range. Some nintendo ds games have a online feature which is a step in the right direction and is a pretty cool feature concerning games. Nintendo needs to make a super smash bros. or a f-zero game for it or port mario party 1 2 and 3 from n64 over. Mario party ds failed. I played it for 5 seconds after renting it and returned it. That's my biggest problem with the ds is theres not alot of games that spark my interest except for a few. Those that liked ocarina of time or majoras mask for the n64 will be dissapointed with phantom hourglass and spirit tracks. Again they are extremely gimmicky and just not the same. The touch screen is a complete joke and just a huge gimmick sucker. All the Nds games revolve around it. In general i wouldn't recommend this system to the teenage audience. Overall I love the ds and just how durable it is but like i said I wish nintendo would make better games for it. Another thing I have to add is the pictochat function. It's extremely gimmicky. It's basically a texting tool and you quite literally have to be in the same room next to somebody because it doesn't reach very far. I could just talk to the person if he or she is in the same room. It does do nicely though if your like in a quiet zone and have to be quiet. Otherwise it is not to exciting, just another gimmicky ds feature.

Pros

+ Extremely durable, hard to break
+ 3 awesome games super mario 64 ds, mario kart ds, and new super mario bros. I recommend these games.
+ added gba slot for gba game support
+ wireless multiplayer with ds games plus ds download play
+ awesome silver color
+ also a worthy note it has the same charging cord that works with a gba sp
+ some games are wifi(online worthy)

Cons

+ extremely gimmicky ds games
+ most games revolve around the touch screen
+ absence of gbc and gameboy game support
+ no link cable connector to play multiplayer with gba games
+ only one brightness setting on or off
+ gimmicky texting tool known as pictochat

Ive been anticipating its release for a while, and now that it's out, im not dissapointed at all. Generals is based on issues and global conflict our world today. You have the option of playing as China, USA, or an underground organization, known as the GLA(Global Liberation Army), each with its own distinct capabilities and missions.
The graphics are simply awe-inspiring. Almost every other move you make, is followed by a very neat video-clip. Trails left by cruise missiles and F22 Raptors is stunning. Buildings and houses and civilians are very life-like, similar to Sim City4.
You get to fight in Urban areas, deserts and many other locales.
The gameplay is very similar to other RTS games. If youve played Real War and Real War: Rogue states, then C&C Generals is nothing new, besides the improved graphics. Loads of levels to play, and ton's of strategies to adopt adds a good replay-value to this title. Sounds are very well done and the music is superb.

I realize that it's considered an expansion (even though it is a stand-alone product), but for the price I think I should get more than a partial evening's worth of entertainment out of it. Total play time... a little under four hours.

The good:

* Is more difficult than the original HL2. 90% of the game is spent battling endless hordes of zombies and antlions and soldiers.

* Looks beautiful - excellent scenery and atmosphere.

The bad:

* Short. This is nothing more than a playable demo - an expanded Lost Coast.

* Plot? Play the original HL1, or to a lesser extent the original HL2 if you want plot. HL2:E1 is pure shooter.

* A majority of the game is horrible escort missions. Protect Alyx - if she dies you lose. Protect the citizens - if they die, you lose. ESCORT MISSIONS! ARGH!

* Runs poorly on my machine. Even with accepting the ""recommended"" settings for my system, which are less than what I currently have the original HL2 set to, it runs at half the speed.

The ugly:

* Level design is far less linear and intuitive than the original HL2. Sometimes this is a good thing as it adds another dimension to the game, but after a while it gets annoying when the primary goal of the whole game becomes solving tedious navigation puzzles.

* One new monster (two if you count the stalkers, which you see but never actually get to engage in HL2), but no new weapons, in fact you get less weapons in HL2:E1 than in the original HL2.

Anyone who enjoyed the original Half-Life 2 will get this game anyways, regardless of good or bad reviews. I'd say that if you're casually looking around for a game, you could easily find one with a far better fun to cost ratio.","Sweet, but way too short",1149292800,5,,

I liked the things that were added...a dog for your companion and other features.  Minus the occasional freezing of the game or so I thought.  That is until it happened again a hour or two later.  At first I thought it was my 360 but all my other games play fine on it.  So i popped it back in and started ""trying"" to play again.  This time is just loaded and froze...tried one more time and the same deal.  It loads and the game just freezes and that's all that I can seriously take with Fable 2.  I truly enjoyed the first game and was looking forward to this one so much I bought the Limited Edition for it despite the warnings otherwise.

I've never just stopped playing a game and given up because of glitches/bugs.  Shoddy gameplay or a weak story perhaps.  But i've never had issues like I have with this game and after I waited this long to finally get around and play Fable 2.  It makes me even more frustrated and upset over the company for releasing a game that wasn't ready to be put out.  It's cool about putting out a patch and what not.  But that would not be necessary if they simply put the game out like it should've been minus the sorry and game ending glitches.

As it stands I enjoyed what i played of the game but not after the issues I've experienced.  Fable 2 will go right back on the shelf of gams I don't touch anymore.  I'll find something else worth my time because this one isn't it.

When I was ready to replace it, I looked for something that was pretty much exactly the same as the G5. The G500s is really a worthy successor to the G5.

When not spinning freely, the wheel has a very, very nice 'clicking' motion - not a loud motion at all; it just feels perfect.

One of my favorite things about the G5 was the adjustable weight. I was very pleased to see that this feature was retained for the G500s.

VASQUEZ,"I'm a huge God of War fan, been playing it back to back since the first one came on PS2, and the story and gameplay of previous installments was top notch, so much that of course i bought this one as soon as it came out. I had read some positive reviews that made a point of some type of inconsistency in the story, but i payed it no mind and just bought my game as i usually do. After finishing it, i have to say i'm greatly disappointed as to what was done with it, particularly with the story. But let me divide my review in specific points.

GAMEPLAY: Simply the best of the series as far as gameplay goes, there's just so much content here, many new weapons, many new ways to fight enemies, they certainly upped the bar here and you'll find yourself enjoying the fighting like never before, particularly the boss fights which are incredibly epic, specially the earlier ones you run into. You have a total of 4 weapons including your blades, new moves, new enemies and new fighting mechanics, again this was done very very well.

STORY: This is where we run with such a huge screw up, that i can't begin to understand what could have possibly happened in development that could have led to such a big inconsistency. Story wise the game has a start like no other in the series, i will say it's the BEST by a huge margin, and it remains that way for most of the first half of the game, but then suddenly a change of focus occurs that makes no sense at all, and almost everything that has happened in the first half, and that has served to drive you that far, is simply forgotten, as if it has no meaning at all. Basically the first half and second half of the game feel as if they were developed by different people, there is no cohesion with the story, you start a quest of taking down the gods with the titans on your side and then at one point titans simply disappear from the map, nothing is said of them, of the new war between them and the gods, you don't even get to see any of them anymore, it's just you, by the end of the game this continues with no explanation. All of it feels so out of place one wonders what the hell happened in sony when they were working on that second part, which honestly feels like a whole different game story wise.

In conclusion this lack of cohesion in the story, the lack of coherence of it as a whole, really takes a huge lot from the game, because ultimately half a game is it's story, the other half gameplay, and while the gameplay is excellent as usual,the story really is a stupid mess that i am left wanting an explanation of why that is.",An entertaining but ultimately underwhelming followup to the amazing series,1269648000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It is possible that Sony has addressed some of the issues I refer to in newer runs; though with their track record I seriously doubt it in some cases.

In all honesty, to say the PS2 (and the original PS) was/is not a great gaming system would be a complete, bald-face lie. Considering their systems have beaten back competition despite never being the most technologically advanced competitor in the running speaks volumes, but to make such a statement is ultimately misleading. In reality, the PS2's success (and Sony's success for that matter) really has comes from the plethora of great titles from a handful of solid developers, not from the hardware.

Playstation's biggest failing (other than the PS2 Hard Drive and any kind of quaility online play) has been overall quality. When I talk overall quality, I don't mean how many polygons the machine can push at any given second as that's relatively unimportant in the vast scheme of things, but rather the machine's overall durability and structural integrity. One might think this re-design might solve some of these issues from the original PSX and PS2. Well, in short, it doesn't.

It may be true Sony is not the only company that has had hardware problems cast a shadow over their console (the original Nintendo would be a prime example), but Sony seems defiant in learning lessons from it's own past considering hardware problems have been a consistent factor throughout their history. Here are a few examples concerning the slim PS2:

#1: Never buy a slim PS2 and think your going to kill two birds with one stone with a game/DVD combo. This is the biggest misconception people have; over time the PS2 will eventually have trouble running about half of anyone's DVD collection, especially anything that runs off a dual-layer DVD. The fact my Family Guy and Futurama DVD box sets won't run on the machine after having it for a year and a half proves this to me. The PS2 is no substitute for an actual DVD player, so don't be cheap and save yourself a headache and buy a DVD player to boot.

#2: The situation with dual-layer DVD's also applies with many games that use the format as well. I can literally spend hours trying to get my Wild ARMS Alter Code:F and God of War to work, yet when I insert the same games into my friends old-model PS2 that is twice as old they work right off the bat. That's not right, especially considering those games where brand new.

#3: The fact you can NEVER fully shut the machine off (less you unplug it) like one would with the switch in back of the older PS2's raises too many questions. Anyone familiar with the original PSX knows even when the power was shut off, that it still drew in a minimal amount of electricity. This was probably one of the main factors that attributed to the original PSX's problems. Why would you bring back such a potentially damaging feature? When I turn the machine off, I want it COMPLETELY off. That's what OFF means Sony!

#4. Anyone who purchased one of the newer slim model PS2 shortly after it was introduced probably found it nice when there was a voluntary recall on the power pack. Yeah, that just makes me trust in Sony's products even more. The risk of fire and burns always goes well with any gaming experience.

Despite everything I have said above, if you like the games the PS2 contains in its gaming library, you're going to buy it anyway (hell, I did). However, as with any system, I would definitely advise against buying any kind of Playstation hardware the minute it comes out (outside of the initial price).",Almost more trouble than it's worth...,1104278400,,{'Edition:': ' Black'},

Since then, my dad and I have bought and played every MLB game made by them and we love the series.  I've been playing the show on PS3 since 2008 and each year they find a way to make it better. This is definitely one of the years of more subtle changes, but it's hard to top perfection, which SCEA has pretty much reached with their MLB series.

Rather than over criticize this game like some people choose to do, I take this game for what it is and don't ask for more than is needed in a solid baseball game.  Take it from me, I've played this series FOR years so I wouldn't BS you if this game really was bad.  So here's my list of pro's and con's of the great ""Show"" MLB franchise.

*PROS*

- Very realistic and accurate batting stances
- Smoother pitching/batting/fielding animations in comparison to years past
- Realistic fan atmosphere, gets better every year
- Turn off the in game commentary and given that you have a surround sound system, you'll feel like you're actually in a Major League ballpark.
- Overall baseball physics are tweaked every year to match the real thing, and these guys have almost got it down pat.  Just compare from MLB 2005 - Present
- Adjustable gameplay settings for ANY user.  Experienced, Classic, New Player, etc.  Don't like the swing stick, no problem.  You can switch it to the classic button swing to fit your style.  An amazing overlooked feature that doesn't get enough credit I think.  They've kept the classic settings available for the series tenured players :)
- Games will play out very similar to real life MLB games.  Hot streaks, strikeouts per game (based on skill of pitcher), hits, home runs, etc. Unless you are a gamer nerd that tweaks the settings to your advantage.  You'll find that your season stats will be accurately comparable to real life MLB stats.
- More realistic camera angles, similar to that of a televised MLB game.
- New character animations add more realism. EXAMPLE: a pitcher will clinch his hand to a fist and blow in it to try and warm his hands during colder games.
- Vibrating controllers via Dualshock 3 in clutch situations really pull you into the action and get you into the game even more

*CONS*

- Color commentary could use some fresh faces/voices.  All respect to Matt Vasgersian and Dave Campbell, they've done a great job over the years, but it's time to pass the mic.
- No Doubt Home Run swings could use some new or added animations.  I'm seeing a lot of recycled animations here..
- Replay Mode available in Home Run Derby
- In game fight animations shown as result of hitting to many batters.
- Rain/Snow delays either before or during started games.  EXAMPLE:  A message could prompt before starting a game in season mode that the game you wish to play was rescheduled do to rain/snow and you'll play a double header or play on an off day.
- Even more realistic day/night transitions.  Clouds, colorful sunsets, full moons, etc.
- Mix up the cover athletes more.  Since ""The Show"" moniker has been implemented in 2006.  3 Boston Red Sox players have made the cover...
- Real Time Roster Updates, allow the download and application of roster updates IN season/franchise modes as the real life MLB season plays out. This helps avoid the players/gamers having to try and trade players themselves to match their real MLB team they're playing after.
- More classic stadiums that can be available via downloadable content or unlocked but saved and streamed from the main hard drive of your console as to not worry about taking up disc space on the physical game.

Well their you go, that's my list of PROS and CONS for The Show.  I'm sure their are a lot more things I could put down under each of those categories, but for the time being that is all I could think of.  Bottom line, for any average gamer and MLB fan, this game is a must have.  It's fun, exciting, challenging, and entertaining.

( Which gave the game a 5.7 ) I wasn't expecting too much out of this game, but since I have the Game Pass at Blockbuster, I rented this anyways. This is the story: The Dirty Bubble got pushed into a washer and he turned into a whole lot of small bubbles. It is up to the Yellow Avenger; A.K.A Spongebob; to capture all these buckeroos and save Bikini Bottom. Here's my review.

Graphics: 8/10. These are some really nice cel-shaded graphics. The graphics obviously look better than the DS version of the game, and there are really nice character animations as well, so there is really no problem with the camera angles or doing anything as far as moving around is concerned.

Sound: 6.5/10. I was really dissapointed with the sound. I was expecting to hear voices from the showm but really, the only thing you hear in this game is a little music in the background and the squeaking of Spongebob's boots. It's not too annoying, until you have been playing the game 3 hours straight. That's the time when you turn the volume to mute.

Control: 7.5/10. The control is fine. You can use the D-Pad ( I wouldn't reccomend ) or the analog nub, which makes the moving a lot easier. Most of this game is just a 3D side scroller, except when you walk in places like the Krusty Krab, Spongebob's House, Squidward's Pad, stuff like that. Either way, the control really is not bad at all. You just side scroll left or right and basically just jump around onto platforms, and onto the citizens head's to get the bubbles off. This can be frustrating, though, because sometimes when you jump it may delay or something, or it's really picky as to where exactly you have to land on their head.

Fun: 7/10. Since this game is relatively short, this game is really just an excellent rental. For fans of the series, they should definitely rent this game. It is a decent amount of length for the game ( I've played for three hours and I'ma bout 30% thru the game, but it really depends on how fast you are at games. ) And this would be a great game for kids. The only real problems with this game is just the fact is doesn't have character voices, which was a let down, the chores are tedious and you will have to back track a lot. Chances are, if you know where people live in the show, you will have a better chance of finding what you need. There are 9 different locations to visit around the ""Spongebob World"" including Residents area, the City of Bikini Bottom, Goo Lagoon, Jelly Fish Fields, Rock Bottom, Mrs. Puff's Driving Class, and more. You can also of course interact with favorites from the show, such as Mr. Krab, Pearl Krab, Squidward, Patrick, Sandy, Mrs. Puff, Larry, and even some lesser known characters such as the ""surfer dude"" Scooter, and the police officer Officer Nancy. Like I said, this game is well worth a rental, but not neccesarily a buy.

As soon as I started using these, I immediately noticed they were worth the price. No pair of headphones are ever going to ""surround"" you with sound (it's just physically impossible), but these have a monumental power, clarity and seperation - not just broad stereo depth, but they easily handle everything from the smallest piece of glass breaking to the most roaring bass and monumental explosion. Atmospheric acoustics (""room sound"") are staggeringly well handled. Probably best and most impressive of all, they are completely and utterly quiet when there is no sound playing, I've never known anything like it with wireless headphones! No hiss, no buzz, nothing. I wouldn't call them ""isolating"", but they deliver such gigantic sound that it doesn't even matter, you'll be lost in the experience.

I also enjoy enhancing my Sims skills and advancing them in their jobs.  I do not enjoy just watching them interact so that I can ""play house."" Because of that, The Sims Vacation was the last expansion I bought because it disappointed me for the same reasons the Hot Date expansion did.  I'm sure there are people that love to role-play their Sims in new downtown districts (i.e. Hot Date) or hotel resorts (i.e. Vacation) but I found both of those additions boring.  It's already hard enough to keep all the Sims hygiene, social and other tabs updated, and it becomes even more difficult when you take your Sims on vacation.  Sure, it's interesting for a few minutes to watch your Sims ride an attraction or another expansion feature but it's not what made the game fun for me in the first place.  I would only recommend this expansion for the diehard fans of The Sims series.  I'd check out The Sims Unleashed or The Sims Superstar expansion packs (the two most recent expansions) first because they seem to focus on normal gameplay enhancements instead of the ""side attractions"" that make up The Sims Vacation or The Sims Hot Date.  Of course, if you only want new decorations and furniture, Vacation adds it own fair share of the normal expansion extras.

1. To keep my PS4 vertical (using less of a footprint on my desktop)
2. To keep the electronics cooled.
3. To charge my controllers.

The first two, this does flawlessly. I'm glad to have the extra space on a less-cluttered desktop, and I'm able to play 16+ hours at a time without the console getting hot.

If one of your main reasons for buying this is as a charger for your controllers, you may want to look elsewhere. In theory, this is a good idea, but in practice, this may damage the connector on your controller when you try to put it in the charger. If you want one that will not damage your controllers, I would recommend http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ENFVJJO which I also purchased through Amazon.

In ""Dark Forces"", the first of the series, you really only begin to learn the basic brute skills of fighting. You also learn several mind skills, not powers, but necessary exercises to prepare you for the coming hazards in the next challenge. ""Dark forces II: Jedi Knight"", brought in a new level of graphics and a whole bunch of new worlds to explore. Jedi force powers make dog meat out of the villains. A new darkness arises, and Kyle Katarn destroys one Dark Jedi at a time, until he finally bring's a new balance to the force. Also you learn the tragic and mystical nature of Kyle's past. In ""Mysteries of the Syth"", you meet a new character named Mara Jade, Kyle Katarns Apprentice in training. What seperates this game from the others in skill, is the awesome long-distance sniper scope attatched to your quick fire storm pistol...
This new addition to the series, Outcast, will develope Kyle's skills. With Familiar, and new world's and the ability to ride the line, using both light and dark skills, it will no doubt be a blast from the old briar pistol. But, will the graphics surpass Alice? I personally shout out the challenge to the design crew. (The five stars were given only in hope!)

But what drew me to this year's game the most was its tribute to the famous attitude era that played a huge part in the industry from 96-01 (from Austin winning the 96 KOTR to the demise of WCW). In it we get dozens of wrestlers from the attitute era (from The Rock and Stone to Billy Gunn). We event get a mod,e that replaces Road To Wrestlemania mode/storymode, that lets us reinanct the great matches from that era. Of course we still get most of the current roster. Although despite the game's large roster (over 100) we get duplicates. Meaning certain wrestlers take up multiple spots (three HHHs, three Foleys, 2 Cenas, 2 rocks, etc) so some wrestlers missed the cut especially popular guys like Tyson Kidd and William Regal. However a good ammount of guys excluded are included in DLC and for once all of the dlc wrestlers are ones fans were hoping were going to be in.

One of the big issues last year was online. Most of the time, players cried in anger as they weren't able to download created content or even play online. Fans were hoping this year would be different. For the most part it is. We can easily download created content with no problem. But online plays has a tendency to freeze or just no work. Sometimes you will win a grueling match and despite it being a rated match you won't get the win. Now these issues don't happen all the time so it shouldnt take too much fun out of it.

Universe 3.0 is vastly better then past years. In the mode that allows you to create your own wwe world, this year the included the ability to make more shows on any day of the week (mon-sat) and even delete/edit current shows to your pleasing which is something fans have been wanting for a while. Now Universe mode still has its problems but its still a fun expereince. One big feature have been begging to return is create a belt which allowed players to create their own championship. The good news is it returns however ownly as edit a belt. Meaning we can edit an existing championship belt by changing its color, name and call name. Its still cool as we can assign it as a belt for your original show. Now what is always expected in any game, there are bugs and glitches. Stuff that even defies the laws of physics. I won't get into details but if you played past games, its the same.

Overall this is a great game. Its far from perfect but being able to make dream matches featuring stars from today and the attitude era makes this the perfect game for current and old school wrestling fans

Pros:
-Attitude era mode and wrestlers
-Huge improvement to create an arena
-DLC we actually want
-Being able to make a third brand in Universe
-Ability to make dream matches
-Create a belt is back....sort of

Cons:
-Online is still annoying at times
-Duplicate wrestlers
-Exclussion of popular wrestlers (Regal, Kidd, etc)
-Bugs

4.0,False,"12 25, 2007",A153TQ6SEWXYQ4,B000E6NF5M,Stephen Veasey,"I know all reviews are subjective, but the wide disparity in opinions about this game made me reluctant to buy it. Well, I got it as an xmas gift and I have to say it really is a 'game of two halves'. If you don't persevere through the first section of the game, which is really an exercise in memorising locations more than anything else (only a dozen or so objects to find and use, and it will take you probably 4 hours to do this)then you miss out on the MUCH better second part of the story where there are a ton of puzzles to solve, although still not that many items to use.

The people who made this are obviously big fans of two games in particular - there are floating islands, teleportation devices and lots of strange levers to pull like in Myst (the teleportation devices use EXACTLY the same sound effect as used in Myst); the main character is supposed to be like April Ryan from The Longest Journey, her sidekick Zak is Crow from the same game. There's even a talking tree just like er, The Longest Journey!

Once things started picking up in the second part I really wanted to finish the game to see how things were resolved and I didn't find it cheesy or corny at all, in fact I was quite moved by the ending. It actually showed some quite deep psychlogical insight into the nature of grief and how to get over it.

Just to deal with the negative points of the other reviews -

1. The voice acting - really only the Merchant is irritating and you don't interact with him very much so who cares?

2. Character graphics - I don't know what people are looking at or why they concentrate so much attention on the length of the characters arms, the character graphics are perfectly ok.

3. Somebody mentioned the 'controls are horrible'.. but all you use is the mouse,theres absolutely no manual dexterity required to solve any of the puzzles so which 'controls' are these exactly?

4. Strange camera angles..all that happens is that you occassionally see the characters from a ceiling viewpoint, this is so that you get a panoramic view of the room you're in, it doesn't get in the way of playing the game at all..just point and click to where you want to go.

5. Lots of tedious walking/trotting around..yes, I'm afraid this does happen a lot in the first part of the game. I can see how the designers wanted you to move around a lot so that you would find all the rooms and be able to memorise their locations, but not having anything interesting to do once you got there doesn't make for a fun time.

The pros for this game are -

The in-built hint system - I can't believe somebody wrote that they had to go on-line to get help for puzzles, the game has its own walkthrough included! Any puzzles I felt I could get past in 20 minutes or so I gave a good shot at solving, the ones that I knew would take hours I just auto-solved. (Even then, one puzzle took the computer ten minutes to play through, that would have taken me days to work out.)

Puzzles that are actually integrated into the flow of the game, not some random events that have nothing to do with the environment you're in.

Very, very simple interface - there's absolutely nothing that can go wrong here, inventory items are used automatically in the areas you need them, you don't even need to use the right mouse button for anything..brilliant!

Graphics are excellent, but mainly static. Cut scene graphics are I think intentionally 'grainy' so I wil cut them some slack there.

The game is plenty long enough, I finished it in about 16 hours, but that was bypassing the tougher puzzles and using the Help function a lot to point me to the next correct location. If you play this 'properly' you could be looking at 30 hours easily.

If you have got this far I would just like to sum up by saying that Keepsake isn't the greatest adventure game out there, but its far from the worst. If you can pick it up cheap or borrow it from someone its definitely worth playing, but ultimately leaves you a bit flat when its finished.",Better than I expected..,1198540800,8,,

Yes it was that good!!!  And this comes from a person who does not consider himself a gamer.  The sequel Sith Lords adds a dose of polish to some of the rough spots from the original game, such as new Faces for the heroes, more choices and control over companions, and one of my favorites although a minor thing to some people.  The Jedi robes look much cool then they did in the first game.  Even more feats and Jedi powers have been added into the mix, and I am sure that everyone has their Can't Miss combonation that they choose EVERY time they play. I know i do!!  The graphics are very nice, and the gameplay is simple for if i can master it then anyone can.  it does take some practice and skill to acheive the right combo's of feats, skills, and powers so don't feel bad if you don't get it on the first play.

  The story follows the first game, this game taking place 5 years after the original game (new players should really play the first Knights of the old republic first to get the full effect of some of the lingo, and special appearences from the previous game.)  You are the last jedi, and of course the Sith are chasing you all across the galaxy, and you must use all of your abilities to either fight for the good, or the evil depending on your preferences.  Though it does not carry the whopper of a plot twist that the original carried, and one of the few downsides of the game in my opinion.  The story moves along very well in the beginning only near the end does it bog down a little bit in crosses, doublecrosses, and minor glitches in the game that left me puzzled with cut scenes that did not make sense such as the one scene where one character appears to kill another character but then all is forgotten once the cut scene has ended.  I'm sure that you have read that the game ends on a bit of a downer, only due to the fact that i suspect that Kotor III is due out sometime, cuz the game literally leaves you hanging in space.

The game is entertaining at first with it's unique world but becomes boring very fast.  I enjoyed the first Tomb Raider, which was released some years earlier, more than this game. A major reason for that was because Alice doesn't require much problem solving like the Tomb Raider series does.  Everything in the game is rather straightforward and it's recommended that people who dislike animation and sequences that are nothing more than creative clips meant to point you (literally) to the next scene should avoid this game.  Unless you've got an empty schedule, the good news is that it will take some time to complete American McGee's Alice.  But as far as ground breaking games, this is a half-hearted attempt.  Even though you can find other games on the market with the same format, Alice doesn't stand out much from its competitors.  Impressive artwork is the only aspect that stands out for this game.

Seasoned RPG fans might want to pass on this title, since it pales when compared to any ""Final Fantasy"" game, or even other PS2 RPGs like ""ICO"" and ""Drakan: The Ancients' Gate"". For people new to RPGs, this is a pretty good start.
The story is nicely put together, and fairly easy to follow. It has a few original elements to it, giving this game some credability. The combat system takes some getting used to, but becomes sencond nature after a while. Magic plays the biggest rols in ""Summoner"", aand you have a wide variety of spells to choose from. As you progress, you learn more skills, gain more experience, and obtain better weapons. There are times when this game reminds me of ""Suikoden"", more in style than setup.
In the visual department, this is a pretty well done game. The animation is nice and fluid, and the textures and colors make ""Summoner"" a visually pleasing experience. There are a few glitches, which might be annoying to some, maybe not even noticed by others. The camera is a bit dodgy at times, and I often found myself struggling to get a good angle. The music is average, nothing memorable, but not unappealing.
My beef with this game is the lack of a good in-game map. I have gotten lost so many times, and have struggled to get back on track. This adds time to the game, but not time you spend enjoying the game. This is a flaw that might make you give up on ""Summoner"". Overall, this is nothing special.

Well, there's just not enough to either the shooter elements or the horror elements to really hold my attention.  The shooter side of things is okay, but the enemies and missions are really repetitive.  Your objectives for each new ""interval"" are pretty much always just ""keep looking for that guy you've been looking for.""  As for the horror aspect, that's just weak.  There were parts of Resident Evil 4, Half Life 2, and even Fallout 3 (esp. the Dunwich Building) that were scarier than anything I saw in this game, and those games all had a ton of other stuff going for them beyond the scary bits.

I think the reason this game falls flat for me as horror is twofold: 1) playing a soldier fighting other soldiers will never be scary (in a game), because the threat is too easily understood -- guy shoots at you, you shoot him; 2) the part of this game that could be scary because it's so much of an unknown, the eery little girl, is too front and center to be any kind of a shock.  I mean, she's on the freakin' box art.  When the kid in the Shining turns the corner and sees those twin girls just standing there, that's genuinely creepy, because you have no idea who they are or what they're capable of.  You've basically got the kid in this game figured out after the opening cut scene (some psychic experiment gone wrong - check!), so any surprise is just about exactly what kind of powers she's going to throw at you.  You get the same level of uneasiness going up against a boss in a Zelda or Mario game for the first time.  This game does offer a few basic half-seen-movement and jump-out-of-the-closet scares, but those would be way more effective if they didn't start the game by telling you exactly what was behind them.

I am level 20 in bloodborne and i am forcing myself to really finish the game.  The physical combat of the game is great i have no issue with pure melee.  The design is great.  The atmosphere is great.  But it's lacking versatility.  If an enemy can use magic and a boss can use magic then why can't the player use magic????  Please don't give me that crap about ""git gud"".  I am great with physical combat in a game but i also would like to have ""Options"" as how to change-up my play style for a certain boss or enemy.

Lack of versatility in a game kills the replay value.  Once i beat this game i will most likely not play it again simply because i will be using the ""Same"" play style over and over and over, does not matter how many characters i create.  As i said before, i have 4 characters in each of the 3 souls games.

Im level 125 now.  I been doing mostly grinding to level up, no problem with grinding.  However, i find the use of having a GUN for ""Parrying"" is dumb and stupid.  When parrying in most games, you either use a shield or your bare hands.  Using a gun for parrying is only useful if you have the BULLETS.  Now, u can either FARM the BULLETS or buy them.  If you buy them the cost is ASTRONOMICAL from the tub merchants.  My point is if you run out of AMMO in the middle of combat u can't parry.  There is a mechanic where you can use HALF of your HP to make BLOOD BULLETS which amounts to only 5 shots.  Thats a problem because if you are LOW on HP you can possibly kill yourself, or it won't work, either way if you do the BLOOD BULLET mechanic.

I am still in my first play thru about to fight the Wet Nurse Boss.

Now that the map editor has been released (and with the random map generator included in the expansion pack), HOMM5 meets my expectations for a great game on today's computers.  (Forget about it if your computer is not up-to-date!)

There was a lot of hubbub about the game designers and other side issues (like Starforce, if you are familiar with that), but the game achieved its goal: make a quality 3D version of the series.  (It seems like a lot of RPG makers are going this route nowadays.  Maybe the technology has become cheaper...)

That said, if you don't like the turn-based style RPG that the HOMM series is all about, you aren't going to have your mind changed with HOMM5.  However, if you remember the ""good old days"" when you would buy a new computer just to play the games as they came out, this title might lead you to do that again.

From what I have seen, the graphics are quite intense.  By that I mean that they take a lot of computer resources to keep running properly.  Over time, I have noticed my older system begin to chop up and eventually slow down to a poor pace.  On the newer system, it works great, but you really have to have the hardware!  But if you want to have a fully immersive, 3-dimensional world to scale through, you gotta have what it takes.

The interface was my biggest concern in the beginning as it was not completely familiar with what I remember - and the new features of HOMM5 really kept me learning how to navigate - but over time you master it all.

I appreciate the depth of the character development system.  More so, I like being able to customize my Heroes' roles in my armies.  (Like having magic-specific/all magics, melee-specific, and range-specific Heroes.)

Overall, I think the tradition of HOMM has been upheld nicely, and $30 is a reasonable price given the fact that you are really just paying for your addiction.  If you don't know what I mean by that, see if the HOMM style of RPG suits you.  If so, you will find the $30 somehow!

***** EDIT *****

So look how many years have passed since HOMM 5 first came out.  (Seven, as I write this now.)  Through that time we saw the Hammers of Fate (HoF) expansion, which was only ""okay.""  Worse, for those of us who dropped the cash on the base game and the HoF expansion, was that Tribes of the East (TotE) came out and was a stand-alone, complete edition, and expanded HOMM 5 title.  That is, if you bought the base game and the Hammers expansion, you got ripped-off.  You could have just waited until TotE came out and had it all and more for a cheaper price.  Such is the way of video game development, anymore...

Anyway, I wanted to edit my original review simply because I wanted to inform you of two things:

1)  Do not ever buy the HOMM 5 base game or the Hammers of Fate expansion pack.  Ever.  Only ever buy the Tribes of the East title.  Also, if you have not done so, do this now!  TotE is a must-have game for all RPG fans, especially those who enjoy turn-based strategy games.

2)  HOMM 5: Tribes of the East is selling on Amazon right now for $6.50, but you have to download it through Amazon.  My experience with Amazon has been awesome for a very long time now.  When I tried downloading games, I was pleasantly surprised at their convenience, quality, etc.  That said, I strongly encourage you to download HOMM 5: TotE through Amazon at that price as there will be no better deal on a game as great as this one.

Unreal Tournament is a well known franchise so there's little introduction to what you need to know about this game. If you've unfamiliar though, all you really need to know is shoot the other colored team. Shoot them good!

UT3 feels really familiar since it is essentially the same exact game as all of the other Unreal Tournaments, just with fancy graphics. So why upgrade to the new UT3? Aside from the graphics, the gameplay is enhanced with new modes and new takes with deathmatch and team deathmatch. One of the more interesting things they've added is the titan-style vehicles in certain maps. Basically, you are pitted in a normal deathmatch with players (or bots) and dual until a giant vehicle is available to mount. At this point, you literally just rake up kills until the machine is destroyed. It's a load of fun.

There is a single player campaign, but it's really nothing more than a tutorial to show new players how to play all the game modes. It is co-op, which can be a bit more fun than just playing against the bots. Playing through the campaign allows you to unlock new characters, so it's at least good to go through once. However, you may feel annoyed during some of the capture and hold missions, as your team usually will not hold a territory for an extended period of time.

Anyone who's played several of the Unreal Engine 3 based games already know how wonderful this engine looks. Everything from particles to lighting look great on this engine. Something you'll really like is even though this engine looks amazing, you can usually crank up the graphics and experience no lag whatsoever. This has always been a great feature of the UT series. So slower PCs should still be able to load this sucker up and crank out frags at a steady frame rate.

This game sounds just as amazing as it looks. If you are fortunate enough to have an X-Fi sound card, you'll be thrilled to hear an amazing piece of software to test the quality of your card. This game was built with the X-Fi in mind. All of the guns will thump with bass and bullets will literally sound like they're whizzing past your head.

One of the only disappointing choices they made was the lack of ""Assault"" game modes. These modes were similar to those of Team Fortress 2, where one team has an objective and the other team tries to prevent it from happening. However, the reason this mode was not included is because according to Epic, it was the least played mode in the series. Hopefully a future patch or mod will fix this issue.

If you're a fan of Quake or Unreal Tournament, you'll feel right at home with Unreal Tournament 3. The maps are better, there's modes bleeding from the sides, and there's a good heavy arsenal at your dispense.

It lacks much of the depth of other Civ games, and seems designed to be easier and faster to play.  Some examples: the map is very small, and you have no control over the map size or type.  You no longer build roads square by square, but instead create them instantly (for large amounts of money) and only between cities.  There are no railroads (roads now act much like railroads).

In terms of gameplay, because the map is so small, it tends to feel very crowded -- you'll run into multiple civilizations early on, not too far from where your own settlers begin.  Often the whole map will have only one major continent.  As a result, it's pretty much a scramble to grab as much of this meager territory as you can early in the game.  Then, once you develop a single tank army (by building and combining three tanks), you can pretty much take any city with it, and just walk around the map mopping up.  So there is definitely a difficult mid-game phase where you risk losing cities to attacks or culture, but after that there's a pretty long clean-up phase where your win is inevitable.

It's still fun, but as a more shallow game, the fun is likely to wear off a lot sooner than it would with the older, deeper versions of Civ.

That is, your gladiators and your enemies each take turns moving and attacking in a grid-based arena. Gladius is very deep and can be complex if one does not take the time to learn how to really play it. I had this game for a month before I really discovered how great a game this is. I would reccomend the strategy guide as well, to help you spend your gladiator's earned Skill Points more effectively.
There is so much customization and character development - it is great! The gold you earn from battles is spent on better Weapons, Shields, Armor, Helmets, and Accessories. The graphics are very good, and the ""paper doll"" representation of your character looks great as you try on all the different equipment. Just like in Japanese RPG's, your character stats change colors, red or green, to indicate if the equipment will help or hinder your chance of success in the arena. You can also customize the color of your character's hair, skin color, armor, and clothes. They also have four different styles of outfits you can choose from for each character - you can make all your gladiators the same color (i.e. team colors) or just make them all individually completely different. It's really cool.
As you earn more Experience, your Level or stats goes up - Hit Points(HP), Defense(DEF), Power(PWR), Damage(DAM), Accuracy(ACC), Initiative(INI), Constitution(CON), and Move Rate(MOV). As these abilities go up, the better your gladiator will perform in the arena. Different equipment will also change these a bit. For instance, a certain sword might increase your DAM by 2, but reduce your DEF by 1 which might be good for your offensive-heavy Samnite, whereas your Archer might prefer a weapon that increases ACC but decreases MOV, or whatever. That's just two examples, but the customization is limitless.
Your gladiators are divided into 5 classes - Light, Medium, Heavy, Support, and Arcane . Combat works on a paper-scissors-rock style. Light beats Heavy, Heavy beats Medium, Medium beats Light. Support and Arcane classes are best used from a distance (arrows and lightning bolts, obviously.) As you go up in Level, you also earn Skill Points. These are used to customize your fighters even more! Each character has dozens of different Skills to potentially learn, but you will never earn enough Skill Points to learn them all, so you must select few that complement the gladiator to your liking the most. Once again, I recommend the Gladius strategy guide to help you choose the best Skills for each Class - there are so many branches to develop your character, it can get daunting and hard-earned Skill Points unwisely spent.
The Swing Meter is what keeps the combat from getting boring and static. Just like in golfing games, it's a meter at the bottom of the screen. You have a normal hit(yellow), critical hit(red), and miss zone(blue). It's not too terribly difficult to score critical hits on a semi-regular basis, but it makes you pay attention and be involved in how your fighters do in battle. Enemy A.I. is actually OK. During the fights where the object is something other than all-out combat, (i.e. Points Battle, Barrel Break, Defend the Statue, or King of the Hill) the computer will do some dumb things, but during true battle the computer will stomp you if you don't employ the right tactics and appropriate gladiators (luckily, you can preview who your opponents will be beforehand, so that you may assemble your team with the best advantage.) You are the leader of a gladitorial School, so you are able to recruit a large variety of fighters to choose from.
This game is HUGE. It will take a long time to go all the way through it. You must travel with your School through 4 different lands and compete in numerous Leagues and Tournaments, with the ultimate goal of being able to take on the best Schools in the High Tournament in Caltha.
Each land you travel through (Nordagh, Imperia, Windward Steppes, and Southern Expanse) all have an average of 3 to 7 towns. In each town, there are numerous Leagues and Tournaments to compete in.
Please give this game a try. If you enjoy deep and involved games that can quickly consume hours of your free time, this is a game for you. I hope this game does well, so that we might be able to look forward to Gladius II.",Great sword-swinging fun!,1075075200,32,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

Although This particular system is now over 5 years old and long gone, I will review it because my review I did some sometime back was in the 2+ series.....
.....I saw this in a store some years back at Christmas time, never seen it in any store since. To be honest....my first thought was...why just 40 games?? Sure it sounds like a lot of games but in this day and age, they could have EASILY put all the Atari 2600 games in this system, or threw in some 5200 or 7800 versions of the games. I thought they did it only so they can make Flashback 3 if it sells well. Guess it didnt.
Most of the games plays feels and sounds like the originals from the original 2600 system. ""Adventure"" though doe Not have the easter egg of the programmers room, why not?? It was fun to access that.
They could have put in more of the fun and popular games. Over all it's a good system to play to remember the good ole days of Atari. I'm glad I own the system, I just wish it had more games. I mean some of the ""40"" games were not even games but new creations (homebrews) or games that no one ever really knew....who ever played ""Adventure 2""?

5.0,False,"08 11, 2003",A2JU4FUSW1PBEC,B000067DPM,Michael P.,"There have been a myriad of Star Wars titles over the years.  Most of them have been flight simulations that, while decent, get stale very quickly.  Knights of the Old Republic changes everything.  Not only is this one of the best Role Playing Games in a long while, it is quite possibly the best Star Wars game period.
You start out by choosing your character class.  Depending on the class you pick, you will have a certain amount of hit points, number of skills, and unique abilities when you level up through the game.  For example, the soldier class will yield a stronger character with more hit points, but a scout character will start you out with points in abilities like computer hacking and repair, and you will level quicker and possibly gain more 'feats' (special abilities) per level, but ultimately be much weaker in hit points.
The game itself is somewhat typical of an RPG.  Talk to NPC's and get quests.  There is a main mission throughout the entire game but there is a vast number of side mission for you to complete.  Combat is real-time, though it is a form of turn-based real time in that you will input a command and wait for your action to be performed, but the action will never stop.  When you finally gain the use of force powers, combat will be taken to a whole new level of fun and challenge.  Chances of hitting are based off 'D&D' rules with rolls of dice.  It is computed randomly, and there is good chance of scoring a hit, but at the same time there is every bit as much good of a chance you will miss.
There are some mini-games, such as a card game called Pazaak, which is basically a modified game of Blackjack.  Other games include Swoop Racing, quite similar to the Pod Racing popularized in Episode I and its respective games.  There are also brief stints where you must face ships in combat in outerspace.  It is basically a shooting gallery, and is very easy.  The core gameplay revolves around the RPG game.
The story is very intriguing.  There are many characters who will join your group as the game progresses.  Some are optional, some you might just pass by, and some you might inadvertantly kill before they join you if you aren't too careful!  The characters all have their own little stories and even sidequests that will open up as you talk to them more and more.  Some of the characters, like Canderous Ordo, a grizzled Mandalorian veteran, add a distinct personality to the game.  There are also shocking and surprising twists towards the end of the game that will completley blow your mind, and it keeps the game exciting.  The ability to lean toward the dark side or light side of the force is a fun little aspect of the game as well, and it does have a direct effect on the game's storyline and outcome.  As a fun bonus, as you lean more towards the Dark Side, your skin will become ghostly white and veiny, ala Emperor Palpatine from the movies.  You will also get more vicious, with evil and manipulative responses for conversations.  You earn Dark Side or Light Side points by making decisions and triggering events in the game.  You must be careful...if you lean toward the dark side you will inevitably bar yourself from more of the game's features and easter eggs...but being evil is so much more fun.
Some of your characters will also interact with each other.  For example, having two characters with similar backgrounds in your group for extended periods of time may yield a conversation between the two of them.  Often times the conversations could be heated and negative, other times the characters will get along quite well and be very friendly.  It is little bits like that which make the game a blast to play.  Talking to NPC's can get very boring, however.  Since many aliens don't speak English(Basic, for SW fans and game terms), they repeat the same gibberish over and over and over.  And it also takes them about 30 seconds just to say 'Thanks and goodbye' since they talk so slowly and mutter so much gibberish.  I often found myself speed-reading through the text and skipping along since I had no desire to listen an alien spout 'jibba wubba flubba bobo' 7 times in a row.
Despite the game's pros, it is not without its faults.  For starters, it is extremely glitchy.  Many times the game would momentarily freeze, and then start up again while in the pause menu.  Other times during combat the character would suddenly warp to another part of the area, leaving your other teammates to fend for themselves, often times unsuccessfully.  Sometimes you will freeze during combat, unable to move or execute commands (from a glitch, not from a gameplay status).  Sometimes, characters will die in the middle of a conversation, ending the game.  How or why that happens I don't know, but it is particularly annoying to be in the middle of an involved conversation, and then mysteriously drop dead for no reason.  Other glitches include your teammates wandering off, leaving you to fend for yourself, most of the time unsuccessfully.  They will either become stuck on a corner or will just not participate in the fight, making them useless.  This game easily could've spent another month, maybe even 2 months, in development.  I'm surprised it was released with so many obvious and detrimental glitches.
The game gets extraordinarily hard at the end.  While it is to be expected, since it is the end of the game, there are some parts where it is just too overwhelming.  This adds easily another 5-15 hours in the game, dying and restarting.  Thankfully, you can save anywhere, at anytime.  And saves are unlimited.  This makes for an excellent gameplay experience.
I highly recommend this game to any Star Wars fan.  Even non-Star Wars fans may be intrigued by the game's sheer excellence.  Despite its problems, SW:KotOR stands out as possibly one of the best games i've played, and definitely one of the best games on the X-Box.",Incredible game...best Star Wars game ever.,1060560000,,,

Nevertheless it was very rare to have a video game to come straight from the shelves, that wasn't from the arcades. That answer came through with the release of Rush 2.
The 1998 video game was made exclusively for the Nintendo 64, and not upon any other console. Ironically, the prequel, San Fransisco Rush, was made on both the N64, and the Playstation. The game features many exciting and enduring automobiles through the streets of some of the biggest cities in America, including New York City, Los Angeles, and Hawaii. The game also includes the infamous Alcatraz prison, a hidden course from the previous Rush. Many fans were shocked to know why the game wasn't on any of the other consoles at the time. The sales for the Playstation version of Rush were just awful, and Midway chose to put this only on Nintendo 64.

They create a registry key for copyright protection (which is still annoying) but do nothing besides that. If you don't believe me just check out the Symantec Security (Norton) Weblog, they have a message about this very issue.

That said, the game itself is fun and unique in the sense that you're granted several abilities to use but you could just call it 'magic' and it wouldn't be all that different than other Action Shooters. What really sets this game apart though is the whole feel of the environment. From the very beginning of the story you instantly get the feeling you've been thrown back into the 50s. Every ounce of the environment helps reinforce this as well.

The general story of the game, without spoiling much, is that you've crash landed in the middle of the ocean and found this underwater Atlantis like city created by a rich, anti-government, and very intelligent entrepreneur of the early 1900s. However, obviously based on the nature of the shooter genre, something went terribly wrong.

The minute you arrive your ability to leave is destroyed so you must venture into the city. Throughout this very linear environment you read clues as to what has happened and have to make choices of how you want to behave (which affect the ending sequence but don't do much else in the long term). You also find out about plasmids which are injectable fluids you can use to gain the powers such as freezing things (why a city of people underwater would ever need the ability to freeze things is beyond me but it's nice for killing things).

What's really interesting about the game is how it can be pretty scary at times. I remember one scene, I'm knee deep in water, walking through a shadowing corner, I see a shadow above in the light source of someone, boom! The lights cut and I'm stuck in the dark with something I can't see and I can't move very well. You will also find that you'll run out of ammo very often (which adds to the experience) so that can also lead you to being on the edge of your seat as well.

The game is also visually beautiful assuming it doesn't crash on you like one of the other reviewers had. I'm not sure why that was happening, likely its the games interaction with his video card or the fact he only has 2 GB of RAM and is running Vista (which eats a lot of RAM).

Generally, I'd say it's worth the money to buy and it's pretty fun and fast paced but the general fighting is somewhat repetitive so while it's fun to get new abilities it gets boring at times. If action shooters are your thing though this is a solid game to add to your collection.

However after a few minutes of playing, you realize it still needs a lot of work, and I mean A LOT!

First off, before even putting the game in the DS, the instruction booklet is of no use to you what so ever. I want you to think for a couple of seconds about what you would expect to find in an instruction booklet... (jeopardy music).... now, you probably would have guessed INSTRUCTIONS for $500.... *buzzer* there are no instructions to be found in it!!! The first two pages are the usual warning stuff, then it shows a couple of pictures and some long rant about tag teams and what THQ planned to do with this game. It's made by THQ, why does it sound like it's a preview article from some magazine? There is nothing in it but some dumb rant for 15 pages saying this game is going to rock.... WTF?

So onto the game. First thing I went to was the create a player... and it's pretty disappointing... sure it's the first of it's kind on a DS system, but it has so very little to chose from.... 4 body types, one ripped, semi ripped, not muscly and skinny as ric flair if he had anorexia.... you will not find body types for fat or female. But you can choose whatever skin color you want, as we just can not live without making a hulk hogan mod with green skin to actually look like the hulk.

The rest of the clothing is fairly limitless, you can make a char that resembles what you want, but don't expect to find much there you think is cool, whoever thought bunny ears and a clown nose would be a great inclusion needs to be locked in a sharpshooter for a month.

Moves are pretty limitless to. You can only have 2 weak grapple, two strong grapple, same for reverse positions, a ground hit, a ground move blah blah blah.... thats not enough... I was SO bored stupid trying to go through season mode with an array of 10 moves to repeat over and over and over again, you find yourself constantly quitting season mode to change your custom wrestlers moves to keep some sort of interest going in the game. (doing that won't effect your season)

Also, the limited selection of moves... unlike the other THQ create a wrassler modes, this one doesnt have a selection for weak and strong grapples, it has one lot to select for either, so you could have a weak grapple tombstone piledriver and a strong grapple arm lock... but whats even dumber, the moves you can select are only of that who is in this game. there is 21 wrestlers in this game or something like that, meaning there is only 21 finishers you can select from.... don't look for a Stunner, Rock Bottom, Mandible Claw, Atomic Leg Drop, Figure 4 Leg Lock... there not in this game!
Music and entrance is the same, but they did add 1, and i repeat 1 song that is custom, and it's not worth using.

So... onto game play now.
The graphics are much the same as 08, only the entrances are now included and look pretty good for a DS game. And there is pretty much every arena to choose from (ppv's ect) and each look ok... but you pretty much only see them during the entrance, as every match is an angle in the ring where you can see the ramp but thats it.... and don't look for backstage areas, you can't get to them during matches... what you see in previews is one of 4 areas you visit.... which is annoying, i'll tell you why.... in 08 you went from area to area to either look for an opponent, an office, look for items or to train.... it's not that much of an improvement here.... you start in your house, where you live i guess, and in the room you have a bed, which you have to go to sleep to get to next week, a computer to either save your game or shop for useless items.... a coffee table with magazines to check your progress, who is champ and who you have beaten as well as a checklist of opponents you took on, and your records of win and loss... there is also a cubboard to select items that might give you a bit of a boost in your stats which is a waste of time as you can have all the stats as high as you want, the only one decent to have is submissions so it doesnt take as long to make an opponent tap out.

Then there is wwe headquarters, you go there to talk to vince, or one of the GM's when they call you. Then there is the gym to work out in 3 ways, work on your head using a stupid mini game to lift dumbbells by following a curser on the screen with your stylus stick.... a weight lifting game where you blow into the mic ... and yes, it blows... and another where you have to keep lifting little falling bars back to the top of a box to do the last one.... annoying because you can only do one training thing per week, if you could do it constantly one after the other it might have been ok, but it's annoying having to play home>>gym>>match every time you play... win your match and then your home again to repeat it over and over and over and over and over again.

The matches themselves are a different play then 08, but it still needs so much more work. Using the direction pad and the stylus at the same time just feels awkward. You can get used to it, but why the heck did they bother to incorporate the stylus? It would be so much easier to just use the buttons like the other console versions.

It's also annoying that half the time you get out done by the computer if you try to beat them by doing grapple moves, as the computer usually comes out on top if you screw up or are not fast enough drawing annoying circles on the screen.

And it has those cheap strategies you revert to... like knocking them down and using submissions till you win, or what i find myself doing a lot is going outside the ring, knock your opponent down at the 7 count and get back in the ring for them to be counted out, works 95% of the time... and is cheap but too effective.

So it may not be the same game play and style as the 08 version, but it still is very limited and needs so much, so much, SO MUCH work done to improve this game for DS.

Season mode is boring, too. I already said what I said about the repetitiveness of the game, but the awards and achievements in the game give you no satisfaction at all. A still shot of some diva bimbo smiling and a message saying, ""wwe champion"" is a kick in the teeth to anyone expecting something just a little bit better then a still image... it's like a prettied up version of a NES game that said, ""congratulations, thanks for playing, hope you enjoyed working your tush off for days in order to read this message""

I have not had this game a week yet, and already I have lost the urge to play it again. I just don't care to complete season mode to find out what happens in the end... even if I can find codes that work for it, or action replay cheats... I still don't think anything could make this game any better to me.

I'm not so disappointed int he price of the game, as I got mine for a bargain on ebay, but I would say that if you pay more then 10 for this, your being ripped off.

There are a lot of people out there still waiting to know how this game plays before trying it... all I can say is, don't kick yourself if you have to wait 10 years to find one for 50 cents at a pawn shop, you will not have missed out on a game you must try before you die. It may have a so called ""improved"" style of playing, but it's far from fun.

The in game sound of the crowed is barley there, they only make a sound when you are ready to do a finisher, they don't chant, the game play is stale, the controls are annoying, there is no charisma or fun to the game play, and is in bad need of commentary as the matches get more boring then the last watching to decent looking chars play like absolute stiff drones.","improvment, but still no where near perfection",1228348800,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo DS'}",

What makes it's so great is the ""immersion"" factor -- the depth of the storyline (the conspiracy theories are well written, and the subplots will make you pause and THINK); the options to accomplish goals (shoot 'em up or a stealth or a non-lethal approach); and you may even get to the point of not *wanting* to kill your opponents (uniquely different mindset in gaming), but even feel empathy for them.

This was one of the last big budget games that employed not only rich graphics and music scores (which are superb and change between ambient to charging battle charged ditties), but care in the story plot. Ion Storm really put together a game that even 5 years later is enjoyable (and still has an active modding community -- with some major projects like updating the models/graphics to 2005 standards).

So if you wanted to try something different and more challenging than a deathmatch with Unreal/Doom3/Halflife bots, Deus Ex will not only entertain your need to conquer/explore, but will exercise your brain as well.

Although there have been a few glitches (some user error, some Ubisoft), I can honestly say I love this software program. I'm glad I took the lessons on Justinguitar.com, but I think the game complements quite nicely what I've learned.

There are lots of songs I'm able to play (kind of) now that I never even heard of before I got the game. I'm getting better technically (still have a LONG way to go), and I'm also really enjoying playing the guitar. I'm also enjoying music and learning about song construction and new artists.

There's a lot to this game. Not only do you get the songs to play along with, but there are arcade-like games to help with technique. In addition, there are instructional videos.

This is a great improvement on the previous MLB 2006 title. The show is a phenominal game. It really is. For once. A gamemaker managed to capture a little bit of realism.

The pitching is solid. The games aren't overwhelmed with swing swing swing... there ARE ACTUALLY WALKS!! The method of location on your pitching is very accurate because it isn't an exact science. The pitch CAN STRAY from where you're aiming... but this also can be controlled. The pitch location is a sensitive thing... JUST LIKE IN REAL LIFE. Because when you're facing an Albert Pujols or a Alex Rodriquez... one or two inches here or there can make the difference between a HOMERUN and a Strike out.

The game has tremendous graphics, all the way down to the outfield losing the ball in the glaring sun.

The biggest selling point for me was that the makers of MLB 06: The Show... brought back MANAGEMENT. Yet, you can turn it off in the menus. You can also turn franchise elements like... stadium upkeep, advertising, contracts and $$$ distribution to computer, which I like.

$$ is the very thing that is taking the fun out of baseball, why would I want it in my game... Thankfully, you can leave this stuff to the computer and get to the coaching. You can step back and just let your guy play without interfering, or you can give him the take sign, or have the character shift your fielders, pull in for an expected bunt, steal, hit & run, have your pitcher pitch around, pitch aggressive, pitch in, down or out etc.

The only thing I would suggest to improve this is to be able to send in a PITCH TYPE to your pitcher. Yet, it is pretty accurate that MAJOR LEAGUE catchers mostly do this themselves.

I played this for a few hours, played through the first 3 or 4 games of the preseason, loved being able to go to the mound, get the bullpen going, make changes, pinch-hit, steal, etc. etc.

I was SOLD. I had finally found a game that met all my needs. I JUST WANTED TO COACH. So many times I sit at home and watch game situations where I would have done something different, and THIS GAME IS MY CHANCE to see if my moves would work... and then...

Nobody out in the 7th inning, trailing 5-2... I pinch hit, got a single and David Eckstein came up... with a 2-1 hitters count, I went to give him the hit-and-run signal...

I mean, I had literally already checked my finances to see if I could afford to go ahead and buy the game and... well... I'll guess I'll have to wait EVEN LONGER for my LONG AWAITED MANAGER SIMULATOR. I thought this was it, but game lockups are like dragging fingernails on a chalkboard.

First, Infrogrames took all the cool things about the first edition, and made sure to repeat them in the second. When you launch, you will see familiar challenges and scenarios, and once you start, there is that irritating but ever present merry-go-round once again. How many of you went to sleep listening to that music in your sleep? Yeah, I know, turn it off, but something insane about me thinks it isn't RCT without it.
So the basic format is the same, new lands, new scenarios. Let's move on to the good stuff. First, my favorite, favorite, favorite part of RCT2 is the Roller Coaster builder option. One thing that frustrated me in 1 is the inability just to build rollercoasters. They've taken care of that, and you have access to all the coasters without worry of land or cost to stop you from building. I've made some absolutely horrible coasters that I'm sure if anyone really rode them, their heads would explode! I spend more time in the Roller Coaster designer now than I do in the scenarios.
In the scenarios, major imporvements have been made. So many more rides are offered, making for truly a fun theme part designing experience. You have an ability to alter the enterance/exit booths to fit certain themes, different colors for the waiting lines, signs to add, more themes. It's simply amazing.
And quite the memory hog! I must say my poor PC is sputtering a bit with RCT2. I'm in the process of upping my RAM to play the game smoothly. Although I can run it, the major theme parks are difficult to browse around in. However, knowing what Magic Mountain in California looks like, I was very impressed with the recreation!
So, I must say that RCT2 is one of my new favorite games. I highly recommend this program. Does it have bugs and issues? Of course. Name me one program that doesn't.

This game takes the mistakes of Dragon Age II and fixes them. While this game is not better than Origins it is still a fantastic game on its own terms. The world has opened up you are no longer bound to the city of Kirkwall and get to explore the countries of Orlais and Fereldan which are basically Medieval England and France. The world is not like Skyrim where you can travel from any point. Rather its like Borderlands where you explore sections. While it may not seem like much these sections are massive and filled with loads of quest to do and demons to kill. The Protagonist is fully customizable he can be either male or female and be four different races. Its your standard fantasy Tolkien like, with Dwarves, Elves, and Humans. One that is truly unique is the Qunari a race of horned humanoid creatures bound to their strict religious doctrine. The gameplay is a mix between Dragon Age Origins slow tactical combat to Dragon Age II fast paste hack and slash. It a lot slower than Dragon Age II and its not as tactical as Origins. The combat system is a bit difficult to get use to but once you get it its a breeze. Crafting has been brought back and has been improved. Its a lot more complex and it actually motivates you to get raw material. I got so in to the crafting system by the end of the game all my weapons and armor were crafted. If you know what you're doing you can craft anything better than you find in the game. You get a castle that is fully customizable, its not as deep as the other customizable features but it is still nice. The graphics are a huge improvement over its predecessors. The animations are still the same since Mass Effect 1. The game still looks good and the jump to Frostbite was an excellent one to make. Now time to get to the bread and butter of Bioware games the story and characters. The characters are great its a mix of familiar faces and new characters. They are well written with funny banter exchanged between characters. Some character are better written than others, but there still better than most in other games. The story however is very average and clich&eacute;. I am extremely disappointed with Bioware in this part of the game they did so many things right they forgot an interesting story. My problem with the story is it so average and plain. Your villain is a boring am evil and want to take over the world because Im evil. The road to defeat him is poorly paced. You have to do a bunch of side quests to rise in level and influence. Side quests are a mixed bag some being good other being boring. Also Bioware really loves to show you how much they support women and the LGBT community. Bioware we get you support women and the gay community but stop being so condescending about it. Romance for straight males are a bare bones you get one squad member and one NPC. It is ironic that Bioware tried to be inclusive for everyone when it came to the romance yet they excluded their biggest demographic heterosexual males. The story has its moments where it truly awe inspiring but then it gets average real fast. The ending was really dull the boss fight at the end was way too easy and the ending felt meh, it also tells you that a sequel is on its way. The choice also don't really matter because the outcome is pretty much the same regardless which side you choose. Lore established in the past games has been ignored or retconned. You can tell Bioware focused more on the environments and the world rather than the story. By the end of the story you would have realized that Bioware copied Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivions plot. Demons are coming out of portals you are the only one who can stop them. Some demi god thing is to reach full power to take over the world. Plus theres everyones favorite thing horse armor. My gripes with the story aside Dragon Age: Inquisition is still a fantastic game well worth the price. The Good far outweighs the bad and Bioware improve a lot of things. While not better than Origins it is still better than Dragon Age II. It is one of the best RPGs out for next gen a must buy for any RPG lovers wanting an adventure to the world of Thedas",An Inquisition to remember,1424476800,,"{'Edition:': ' Deluxe', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

Pros: .Amazing art style of the graphics

.Very addicting online combat with friends or strangers

.Trial mode helps you become a better street fighter

.Rival fight cutscenes look great

.ONLINE PLAY(championship, ranked, and player matches)

Cons: .The AI is repetitive and challenging for most even on the easy setting.

.Controls lack responsiveness(Sometimes when I press kick x3 for an Ex move, a heavy kick comes out instead)

.Every character has an ""anti character"". I find this annoying.

.Defensive players automatically have the advantage with no guard crush meter, airblock, parry, no negative penalty for not attacking(no one will stay in the corner and let you charge up a LV3 unblockable focus attack).

.Command and air throws are superior to most moves(even some ultras)

.No blind selection on ranked so people always wait for you to choose 1st so they pick the perfect anti character.

There's tons of fun to be had with SFIV but for me at the moment, I notice start staring into the background while fighting(just loosing focus). I think I just need a break from the game.

Two months after its first appearance in the Nintendo eShop, priced at $19.99, Nintendo has released the game as a retail boxed version at $29.99, ten dollars more. The DLC version requires you to have the ""New Super Mario Bros. U"" disk in the Wii U to play this extra content.  Obviously, the boxed version can be played as a stand-alone title.

Please note: Mario does not appear at all as a playable character.  After beating the game, you can play as Luigi using the standard physics of his brother.

To put it kindly, the Wii U has had a rough first year.  The sales have simply not been there, and Nintendo is fighting tooth and nail to get the install base up for their new machine.  One of the key factors has been lack of software titles.  Nintendo skipped the full blown dog and pony show of E3, instead issuing a Nintendo Direct (an online presentation of the new software titles that the company was launching).  In April 2013, we first learned about ""New Super Luigi U"", a full blown game starring Luigi.  To say we were surprised due to ""New Super Mario Bros. U"" had jut launched November 2012 is putting it lightly.

However, this isn't the whole story.  ""New Super Luigi U"" straddles the fence between a ""brand new game"" and an extensive ""downloadable content"" addition to an already existing game.  I personally believe we have gotten a retail version of ""NSLU"" for a two fold purpose: this DLC is long enough to merit a stand-alone release, and, much more importantly, acts as a stop-gap release in preparation for the all important Christmas season for the admittedly very slim library of Wii U games that have been available in its first year.

While Nintendo has first issued DLC for the 3DS ""New Super Mario Bros. 2"" title, this content was largely confined to brief level packs.  With ""New Super Luigi U"", which has been available as a digital download since July, is completely unprecedented in Nintendo's (admittedly very brief) history of DLC: far from being brief level editions, this game is a whole new compaign staring Luigi, perfectly in key for Nintendo's Year of Luigi which is what they have dubbed 2013.

For new purchasers, let's define what this game is specifically.

WHAT IT IS: A four player game, starring Luigi, two Toads, and Nabbit.  Nabbit is invincible and impervious too any damage and cannot take power ups.  The game features the exact same world map as ""New Super Mario Bros U""; however, all the levels have been reworked and almost all of them start with only 99 seconds.  Luigi's physics have been reworked, making him floaty in terms of his jumping and very loose, slippy traction.  Due to the time limit, you have to move quickly through the levels.  While four players, the levels here are claustraphobic in nature with more than two players, because of how quickly you must beat them (especially for levels where ground is at a premium). While four player mode has been chaotic in the Wii and Wii U ""New Super Mario Bros."" games, it is even more frustratingly difficult in ""NSLU"" due to short level times and the deeply increased challenge of the levels in comparison to the other two Mario games.

WHAT IT IS NOT: a full-fledged, brand new game staring Luigi..  People are comparing this too ""Super Mario Bros 2: The Lost Levels"" and the original ""Super Mario Bros."".  This analogy simply does not hold water.  While ""The Lost Levels"" was little more than a mission pack sequel to the original; this title does not feel or play like a true sequel to ""New Super Mario Bros. U"", largely due to the brief running times of the levels (99 seconds) and the fact that, although the game has been released as a stand-alone title, this is first and foremost DLC (granted, very expansive DLC, the likes of which we have never seen from Nintendo).  Also, given the identical world map, the game plays simply like a reimagined campaign mode for the first game.  What also should be noted is this game, unlike ""NSMBU"", contains no extra modes and features only the 82 levels of the world map as playable content.

Likewise, the price point of this first party Wii U game (29.99 instead of the usual 50-60 dollar range) tells us ""New Super Luigi U"" is not on the same playing field as Nintendo's other first-party titles.  Mario games are famous for keeping their MRSP (or close too it) for years after their initial release, especially Mario titles.  ""Super Mario Galaxy"" and ""The Legend of Zelda: The Twilight Princess"" did not become noticeably cheaper until the red-cased ""Nintendo Choice"" games of 2011-2013, four to five years after the release of these games.

Another thing to be noted is challenge.  The game's difficulty ramps up from the very beginning, and it is clear even in the opening levels that the developers are designing this content for more experienced players. Such unrelenting difficulty (spread throughout the entire duration of the game's playing time) has not been seen since ""Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels"".  Mario, obviously, is Nintendo's bread and butter, and while the Mario games can be challenging, over all they are widely accessible to players of all skill levels.  Such skill level required, consistently maintained at such a high mark throughout the entire duration of the game's worlds, would simply never be considered by Nintendo on a mainstream Mario game, as that would drive away many potential customers and would somewhat hamper the impeccable Mairo brand.

Like Greenland as the largest island in the world (but not a continent), ""New Super Luigi U."" blurs that perhaps hard to define level between new game and simple DLC.  For reasons already outlined, Nintendo has released this has a stand-alone title, but buyers should be aware that this game will not have the same amount of hours as its parent title, due to the intentionally  brief, speed running design of the levels.

For those expecting a full-fledged sequel to ""New Super Mario Bros U."" will find this disappointing to some degree.  For those who go into the game expecting a brief, fun excursion as an extra campaign mode to an already existing title, they will find a lot to enjoy about the game.  Just be aware the game is extremely challenging, and due to that increased challenge, the first ""New Super Mario Bros U"" game will be better if you are looking for four person multiplayer, or, better yet, wait for ""Super Mario 3D World"", which will feature four person multiplayer in a 3D Mario game for the first time ever!","Great, if atypical, addition to Mario platformers",1377907200,78,,

The game for me was a day one buy. Mainly because of my love of the RTS series. Though I am not much a fan of the Ultramarines, the story grabs hold of you very well, though it is very cookie cutter. But honestly a lot of the novels do it the same way from what I hear. The story can be broken down into three segments even though its already broken into 5 different acts. You have the beginning, twist, and end. The beginning and twist are when you realize, oh there is another enemy behind this, and as a fan of the Orks I would really like to see them be the real threat at some point instead of being the distraction that everyone tricks.

Captain Titus is a surprisingly good main character. The three main Space Marines fall into three camps: the mentor Veteran, the battle harden Captain, and the naive rookie. Titus being the battle harden captain, as such he knows that sometimes improvising an assault against the enemy is more effective than just following what the rules say. Mean while the naive rookie berates the Captain at every point, calling him a traitor. I wish that the Veteran character actually stood out more, aside from taking the Captain's side in the in group banter he does very little and isn't that sympathetic. Then again they are Space Marines.

Good buy in my opinion, especially after the price drop. At the original $50 price tag it was worth about $25 to me.","PC game, Fun Times, Great Characters, Okay story",1334966400,,{'Platform:': ' PC Download'},

Sleeping Dogs is EXACTLY that kind of game. I'm nearing the completion (after letting this game sit for a while) and I feel I've played enough to give my opinion on Likes and Dislikes.

Likes: Good story, lots of content and side activities to keep you busy for a while. The Kung-Fu fighting can be pretty fun and rewarding. I know other reviewers have argued this isn't a GTA clone, but lets be honest here IT IS. Unless you consider driving on the left hand side of the road qualifies as being different, then I must be missing something. Look it's not a bad thing, open world games are among the best (in my opinion). Its a pretty good sandbox that's smaller than a GTA, but there's some exploring to do .

Dislikes: I thought Midnight Club LA was the ""King"" of the failed Rubber-Band AI (I own the game) and Sleeping Dogs just proved to me you can do worse and I didn't think that was possible. Street races are equally bad (if not worse) and I've completed all but a couple of motorcycle races. Just an Epic and embarrassing failure for the game designers here. The blind fore system in combat is also terrible. It would be nice to have some kind of aiming mechanism to go with firing from cover, but there isn't. Just watch for where the bullets are hitting and try to judge. Hopefully you can do this before you run out of bullets.

That's pretty much it. What's that, fourteen?) And Three, it gets pretty boring after a while. Mostly, because the missions are all lame, generic, and unoriginal, and the side-quests are all terrible and frustrating. At least, if you actually care abou getting Gold in them, which can be hard to do since many elements, like enemy groups, are set up randomally.

Also, the game is very similar to ""Crackdown"", which was atrociously bad. Only, instead of using terrible firearms and climbing buildings, you use mediocre mutant powers and run up buildings. But everything from the clunky vehicle control, to the awful weapons system, to the HORRIBLE targeting system which only seems to target the enemies you desire to hit the least, to the stupid Orbs on a Rooftop collecting, the game is the same thing as Crackdown. I wouldn't be surprised if the same exact people who made Crackdown made this game. At least PROTOYPE's gameplay is actually fun, even if the grade-school-game-design is exactly the same.

The disguise system, at least, is original and it can be quite fun to play Superhero (or Supervillain) as a teenage girl in a skirt, blonde businesslady or anyone else. I just kind of wish they let you do more things as other people, including the way you walk, react to the enviroment, etc. As of now, the only use it has other than escaping your enemies is the story-related memory absorbtions and being able to access special military items in certain disguises. By far, the gameplay, which includes Experience collecting and upgrading, and the Disguising yourself are the two best (and arguably, only) fun things about PROTOTYPE.

Overall, it's worth a rental if you're the type of person who just wants to kill things in video games and doesn't care about anything much deeper than that. Otherwise, you might just be playing it just to get through it so you never have to play it again. Yeah, like Assassins Creed, Crackdown, and all the recent Sonic games, this is one of those ""chore"" games. But it can, at least, be forgiven since it's a first release.

The Bad: Only one vehicle, very short on BioWare standards

Where should I began? Well let's start with the story. You play (Put first name here) Shepard who is a US Navy Alliance officer and tries to work his/her rank up the galactic ladder. A Turian, named Saren, tries to unleash a supposed extinct alien race that's older than time itself. Can you stop him in time while uncovering the past? With that out of the way let's start with presentation. Mass Effect has some of the best graphics, sound, voice acting, and production values than any game I've ever seen next to Gears of War (courtesy to Microsoft's bank account). The game is packed with tons of extremely detailed textures and models, remarkable never before seen character animations, and BioWare's next-gen dialog engine.

Just like any BioWare game (KotOR, Jade Empire) you decide the fate of the game through your actions with people. You can intimidate them, charm them, or just plain use force. With the dozens of alien races and characters you'll encounter there is limitless possibilities. The game has third person gun play mixed with role-playing elements. You can upgrade your character through an easy to use upgrade menu where you can upgrade tons of stats and attributes. You also have powers that you can use such additionally. Along with you accompanies two other squad members of your choosing and you can give them simple orders. You can hack objects to obtain new weapon upgrades, different types of ammo, and even more armor. There are even a few vehicle sessions as well and this helps mix up game play.

You travel around by using the Mass Effect relay system which can shoot you throughout the galaxy. You can travel to worlds to collect different types of resources, complete side mission and more. Now while all this is wonderful the game does have some major issues. The frame rate can never keep up. It's always skipping and chugging and there's constant texture pop-up as well. There are also random load times every so often. The game is also very short for BioWare standards ending in about 15-20 hours and with all side missions (about a dozen) maybe 25-30. While there is no co-op or online play the game is still fun and is very cinematic and is a wonderful masterpiece.",The game that redefined story choices,1332979200,,,

Balrog gets you in a corner and stuns you with each hit and blocking still lowers your health, but attacking makes you get hit and die.

5.0,False,"01 10, 2014",ATFITLAMHS9XQ,B0053B66KE,Amazon Customer,"Ever since the trading card game came out, I've been a huge pokemon fan. As a kid I would spend hours, sometimes days, scrounging up the change just to get those 1$ pack of 11 cards so I could battle with my brother. It was a huge part of mine and my brothers childhood. I had soo many memories with it.. I remember ruby and sapphire, that game was amazing! Just like it's predecessor gold and silver. I LOVED em. It was the perfect escape from reality.. to adventure.

Buuuuut my love for it kind of faded out after i played the 3rd installment. I started growing up into a little teen dude who just cared about his hair and girls and blahblahblahhhh.. so I completely forgot about pokemon after ruby and sapphire! I missed two whole generations.. And being now that i'm adult that doesn't nearly have as much free time as I did when I was a child... I could't just pick up where I left off, sadly. Diamond and pearl, and black and white are gonna have to wait until I hit a big break.. or until i retire! I just don't have the time to play both of those and X and Y..

But I decided to jump back into the pokemon scene a couple weeks ago and go with Pokemon Y! I ordered the 3DS XL console, a case, headphones, and screen protectors ALLL for this one game (and a link between worlds, but thats a different review) And all i have to say is that my return to the pokemon world has been SO FREAKING MAJESTICAL.

I never thought that me a 20 - year old adult male could feel so young and adventurous just by holding a piece of technology.

The game is just all around amazing, It's the PERFECT pokemon game to get if you've been away for a while.. Or if the previous two generations just didn't appeal to you for whatever reason. The 3D graphics is something I never even would have dreamed of happening as a child. And now that it's happened... I couldn't be more amazed. It really submerges you into the world of pokemon and it's vast greatness. The mystery of the pokemon and their regions is another thing I really enjoyed as a kid that I also felt in this game.. They always find out new legends and things pokemon have done along side trainers in the past... but they never know for sure what really happened.. or why! So that sense of mystery is still there and is greatly appreciated, as it plants wonder in the players head.

I don't wanna spoil anything though. Just know that this game is BIG, and it will definitely make you smile. Especially if you haven't been interested in Pokemon recently. I got chills at various parts just playing this game! I have NEVER had a game do that to me before. Do yourself a favor and save up for this. It really is an amazing game.

There are only a few different firearms like the hunting rifle, assault rifle, and shotgun. There are only two actual explosives: pipe bombs and cocktails. There are only around six different types of special zombies like the Tank, Witch, Boomer, & Hunter.

There are no REAL mission objectives in the game - it's just surviving and getting to another safehouse. Also, at the the end of each campaign you have to radio in for help and then wait for like ten minutes to get picked up and have to shoot a horde of zombies until help arrives, fun but repetitive.

Even the versus multiplayer is kind of stupid because you fight other characters as zombies which makes it kind of predator-prey instead of a free-for-all or team deathmatch style match.

The graphics are standard, but not mind-blowing in any sense.

There is no story whatsoever. It's just you are four survivors trying to get rescued. There is no character development, plot twists, bosses, nothing at all.

Don't get me wrong, this game is a lot of fun, but it's dumb fun, similar to games like Crackdown.

All in all, if you want a game that has simple gameplay, good graphics, and is just mindless fun because you get to shoot and kill all the time - then go pick this sucker up.

+Tight controls that can be customized if need be
+The fighting mechanics mirror the console version of the game perfectly

The Bad:

-There is no Arcade Mode at all
-The ""Gauntlet"" isn't much of a compelling campaign
-You can't even set up a Versus Match against an AI character
-There is no game sharing, if you play against friends they'll need their own copy of the game
-There is virtually no true single player experience

The Soul Calibur series is known for being all around fun to play.  Especially if you've got friends.  But normally they tend to have a fairly decent single player campaign such as the weapons master mode in Soul Calibur II, Tales of Sword in Soul Calibur III (or the story mode) or the Tower of Souls in Soul Calibur IV.  Or, at the very least an Arcade Mode.  Soul Calibur Broken Destiny is a good game... provided you're not playing it by yourself.

There's not real story in Soul Calibur Broken Destiny.  The game is considered non-canon by Namco-Bandai.  There are an assortment of characters to use, mostly ripped straight out of Soul Calibur IV.  And for the most part Soul Calibur Broken Destiny Controls rather well.  Much of the controls are the same as what you got in Soul Calibur IV (although you are missing two buttons).  And if they don't work for some reason you can always go into the menu and change them.  Not only that, but Soul Calibur Broken Destiny is an astonishingly beautiful game.  It may, in fact, be the best looking game the PSP has thus far.  It's almost like carrying around a miniature version of Soul Calibur IV.  The character models are just as elegant and familiar and the stages are just as familiar.  There are a few details missing, but some of them you're not as likely to notice.  The music is also pretty much exactly the same.  The sound effects, voices, etc. will all be familiar to anyone who played Soul Calibur IV.  Unfortunately the other experiences don't quite live up.

In the first place, Soul Calibur Broken Destiny doesn't have much of a single player experience at all.  Almost none, actually.  There's a Gauntlet mode which more or less begins off as a training mode.  You'll have certain objectives in each level.  Once you meet them you'll progress onward.  But this isn't as compelling or as exciting as other modes Soul Calibur has provided for us in the past.  The problem is, from a single player standpoint this is more or less all Broken Destiny really offers.  The rest is battling people online or participating in the various quick matches.  The other is finding a friend with a PSP and a copy of the game to play it with.  If you've got friends willing to take the dive into Broken Destiny with you, the experience really comes alive through the versus mode because it's just a lot of fun.  But when all that is said and done players may not be too thrilled that Soul Calibur Broken Destiny doesn't offer much if a single player experience at all.  There's not actual story mode to tackle and there is no Arcade Mode at all.  And is it really much of a fighting game if there is no Arcade Mode?  Even if you want to play against computer controlled opponents of your choice the Quick Match won't do you justice.  Most of them are custom characters as is, and you can ONLY do Versus Mode if you have a friend to play against.  No setting up a fight against a computer controlled opponent for you.

In the handheld realm especially, offering a good single player experience is pretty much essential to the game in and of itself.  This is why Soul Calibur Broken Destiny isn't nearly as good.  Offering a good single player experience is important because Handheld gaming is sometimes a very solitary thing.  To set up and play with friends is usually an expensive endeavor for your friends.  This is why if you already HAVE friends with a PSP it's no big deal... you just convince them to get the game.  On the other hand, even convincing some friends to get the game is a tough deal.  Luckily in this day and age most handheld systems allow game sharing so that only one of you needs to actually own the game (the other gets a slightly less awesome gaming experience).  Unfortunately, Soul Calibur Broken Destiny doesn't do that either.  There is no game sharing if you wanted to have a quick match with a friend who doesn't own the game.  If you want to play against friends they're going to need a copy of the game themselves.

If you're able to get a lot out of the multiplayer experience of Soul Calibur Broken Destiny, you'll find the game can be fun and enjoyable.  Those who are limited to the single player experience are apt to ask themselves why in the world they actually picked it up to begin with.  Normally handheld versions of some games are stripped down but in the case of Soul Calibur Broken Destiny, they stripped it down quite a bit.","It Has ""Potenial""",1314316800,,,

Unfortunately, I lost the disc several years ago and have been without it since, until recently when I purchased a copy from Amazon.  This is undoubtedly the best game I have ever seen, especially for PS1, since most of those games are quick and easy.  Quite the opposite with this game.  I've only gotten halfway through it because the bosses are SO hard.  Try playing Anubis Rex and/or Space Galaxian and you'll see what I'm talking about.  This game may have been released for other game systems, but none retains the quality and feel that the PS1 version does.

Gets all the main points of economy, public happiness/health, army building, war, and construction of cities. The bones of the game are great, but there are some things that really bother me about it. This review will focus mostly on the main game, as Barbarian Invasion is practically the same game with cosmetic differences. The game play is the same.

One is the historical inaccuracies. Although rather minor for game play and such, it just bugs me that they didn't open their history books to make a historical game. The Egyptians look like Pharonic armies when in reality, during the time of Rome, they were under the control of the Ptolemaic Pharaohs. They were basically Greek and their armies were as such. Phalanx based. There are other historical inaccuracies, but that is definitely the biggest one.

Another thing that bugs me is the AI. They are kind of dumb, even on hard. It is very predictable in most battles with what they will do and you can position your army to counter such things. It is almost like clockwork and if you think about it before battles, you can go in prepared to fight what they have.

The game does crash from time to time, which gets highly irritating, as it happens most often at the end of a pitched battle that I win (maybe that is just when I notice it most...). Installing the Barbarian Invasion expansion and getting the 1.6 patch really helps this issue.

To get the true experience for this game I highly recommend getting the Rome: Total Realism mod. It corrects many of the historical inaccuracies, ramps up the difficulty to make it more realistic, and fixes some silly AI problems.

Overall, even with its flaws, this game has kind of taken over my gaming. I have owned for maybe a year and it is easily the game I play most. It has that ability to make you think if you go one more turn you will finally have nothing to do, you find there is a bunch to do and you keep going. The game is easily a favorite of mine, but only gets 3 stars due to the flaws.","Fun game, but it has some issues",1253404800,4,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

4.0,False,"05 15, 2016",A13BTMCSLTQ48R,B004YQZNFS,Llama Mama,"This was the first ""new"" Nancy Drew game I've played in a looong time. The newest I'd played to date was Shadow at the Water's Edge and that was like a year ago, so to say that I was pumped about The Captive Curse would be an understatement. I didn't really have any expectations going into this game, I was just excited to play something new. But I really loved it and had a blast playing it. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 4.5/5: In this installment our favorite sleuth finds herself in a German castle to solve a centuries' old mystery involving a monster with a penchant for kidnapping young women and taking them to his forest lair never to be seen again. As far as plots go, this one wasn't super creative. It was executed very, very well and the lore surrounding the monster at Castle Finster was interesting but the plot premise as a whole was less than exciting. Also, it got off on kind of a fumbling start in my opinion. There wasn't really any explanation as to how Nancy ended up in Germany in the first place until you're actually playing the game, which kind of bugged me. Even her 'Case File' at the start of the game was very nondescript and basically all it said was ""I'm going to Germany to investigate a monster."" Also, I thought it was silly that the game technically takes place in one night over the course of a 4-hour period. It took me 10 hours total to play the game so obviously it happening in 4 hours is unreasonable - I always think its silly when ND games are supposed to happen over the course of one day or night since the mysteries are so intricate it's hard to believe that Nancy could solve them pretty much on her own in just a few hours.

But other than that the plot was wonderful. It was great learning about German folklore and as I said before the story surrounding the monster at Castle Finster was really interesting. This game had a great sense of humor and I liked how they mixed some more mature things (ie. some really insightful ideas about how a 'monster' originates and how how those stories and fears can perpetuate over time) into the game. It had the perfect mix of humor, scariness, seriousness, and mystery (plus a ton of funny, quotable lines!). Really just a fun and memorable plot.

CHARACTERS - 5/5: Wow, I was so impressed with this cast of characters! This game definitely goes down in the record books (in my opinion, anyway) for having some of the best characters. Each character was well developed with a distinct personality and reasonable motive. It was easy to believe that these could be real people. Not to mention this game had a ton of character interaction. There were 4 suspects; Karl, the Burgermeister (basically mayor of the castle), Lukas, a little boy whose father is the castle's security guard, Anja, a woman in charge of guest services at the castle, and Renate, a traveling storyteller. Lukas and Karl were hilarious and made me laugh out loud many times. Anja and Renate weren't as funny but were very interesting none the less.

Phone friends were great, too. You can call Markus, the somewhat callous castle owner who hired Nancy to solve the case. He was a lot of fun to talk to. Also you can call Frank Hardy and Ned. BUT Nancy and Ned are having some relationship drama (!!!!) in this game which I thought was a really creative thing for HER to put in. I really couldn't blame Ned for being upset with Nancy because from the sound of it she didn't even tell him she was in Germany.

SETTING - 4/5: The graphics in this game were phenomenal compared the the older games I've been playing recently. Even my boyfriend who is not a ND super fan had to stop and do a double take when he saw the graphics - ""Woah, wait, that's a Nancy Drew game???"" I can't wait to see the graphics in the newest titles! Anyway, I really loved the inside of the castle even though I got hopelessly lost in it for a good 30 minutes at the beginning of the game.  It was so beautiful and expansive and made up for the other areas which unfortunately were kind of lackluster. The courtyard of the castle was big but pretty much all you could do there was use the well and get yelled at by the castle residents for knocking on their doors. The forest was also big but only had a couple of things to look at - not to mention I never got the hang of navigating through the forest so it was frustrating trying to find my way back out of it (it was giving me bad flashbacks to the forest of Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake). Overall this setting was definitely eye candy, I just wish there had been more to interact with outside the castle.

PUZZLES - 4/5: I really enjoyed the puzzles in this game. I think that they went easy on the puzzles since the previous title, Shadow at the Water's Edge, was so puzzle heavy. This game was much more plot driven than puzzle driven, which was nice because it reminded me of the very early ND games. It was fun that this game had more sleuthy puzzles like decoding messages and hacking the security system. The puzzles all seemed organic to the story line and there weren't any that frustrated me or were too repetitious. The only thing I would complain about was the Raid game. Raid is a game that Karl has invented and so he will pay Nancy to play it with him to test it out. I of course wanted to buy all of the snacks and souvenirs so I had to play Raid A LOT. I actually liked Raid and thought it was a fun game but it was very drawn out and time consuming. This made it kind of tedious to earn money in the game.

IS IT CHALLENGING? Not particularly. Like I said there weren't a ton of puzzles in this game and most of the puzzles that were there weren't too hard for me to figure out on my own. I only used a walkthrough for a little bit of this game, mostly because I was feeling lazy about some of the puzzles. I would give it a 3 for challenge.

ENDING - 3.5/5: Unfortunately I already knew the culprit before I played this game as I had seen it on a blog somewhere. But I think that if I hadn't known the culprit beforehand I would have had a hard time guessing who it was because this game did a good job making all of the characters seem suspicious. In fact, towards the end I was thinking ""Well, maybe I read it wrong and someone else is the culprit"". I liked the build up to the culprit's reveal because it was very suspenseful. The reveal of the culprit was also exciting and I thought their motive was great and well thought out. However actually catching the culprit was simple and kind of lame - it reminded me a lot of the easy endings of the early games like Message in a Haunted Mansion and Treasure in the Royal Tower. The ending was not the strongest part of the game but I still thought it was well done. Plus the bloopers at the end were actually kind of funny for a change ;)

Plot: 4.5

Because of the cute design, I expected it to be very easy, and was afraid it would be a failure like FF Tactics Advance. I couldn't have been more wrong! This game meets and far exceeds expectations.
The story isn't much to look at, it's true. Basically, by restoring power to the crystals containing water, fire, earth, and lightning, you're trying to halt and defeat the evil lord of darkness, Bebuzzu. His servant Irma (though she doesn't see herself that way) does her best to use her chocobo minions and put a damper on your plans. Your friends Shirma, Croma and Cid, as well as your chocobo pals, help you along the way.
The gameplay is innovative and fun. There are lots of classic FF enemies, as well as songs redone from various different FF games (the music is great), so it's a good pick for FF fans. But even if not, Chocobo Tales has plenty to offer. There are three different types of gameplay as you travel though the island: card battles, minigames, and microgames.
Cards are collected through minigames and microgames. Minigames are found inside of picture books, and must be played to further the story. They involve things like building houses from puzzle pieces, swimming through underwater caves to escape Leviathan, and correctly replaying music. There are many picture books, each with its own story and game.
Microgames are the one spot where the game gets HARD. They were put there for people who are looking for a challenge, and they deliver. There are always two requirements to beat: silver and gold. For each you get a card. Silver is generally pretty easy. But often, gold is ridiculously hard to defeat. They seem to know exactly what amount of points/time/etc. it takes to make winning seem impossible! But when you finally win it's very rewarding.
Card battles are somewhat complicated, but still easy to learn. Each card has a different color - red, yellow, green, blue, or gray - and different attributes. Elements do take effect; for example, lightning (yellow) will usually have a defense against water (blue). Gray is colorless, but more powerful. The battles are a combination of luck and strategy.
Sadly, you encounter less than 10 battles in the game. However, once you've gotten the professional deck you can battle using the Wi-Fi connection, which randomly picks an opponent in the world and lets you get to it. Being good at mini and microgames and choosing your deck intelligently will make these battles a lot easier.
The graphics are spectacular. The game melds a drawn style similar to Okami and Paper Mario with 3D computerization. The 3D look is given to the  island you're traveling around, and the drawn look is reserved for the inside of picture books and the monsters in card battles. It makes the game very interesting to look at.
Overall, Chocobo Tales is a surprisingly wonderful game! In my opinion, it's the best FF game to come out since FFT. It's nowhere near as complex, pretty, or popular as FFX or something, but I think it's much more perfect. I enjoyed it a lot. I've played over 20 hours and I still haven't managed to beat all of the minigames! I recommend for gamers of all ages.

Hint: At the ending credits, don't just sit there! There's still another game to be played!

Facts:
1. You can use this to upgrade your base game.  Just go to steam and redeem the steam code which is included inside the box.  You don't even need to use the CD.
2. It requires Steam obviously.
3. You need to be online on Steam to activate this game which is a 1 time thing, after that, you can put Steam in offline mode by clicking a button.  Next time you run steam will always be in offline mode unless you decide to go back online.
4. It can be played offline after initial installation/activation by using Steam offline mode.  Guaranteed no internet required.  (Been doing this for years)
5. You might want to occasionally go online to get updates on the game as devs fix bugs and stuff.
6. You can legally ""mod"" this game.  Modding is changing certain aspects of the game.  Google it.  Its part of what makes this game great.

Pros:
1. Lots of things to do even without the DLCs.
2. Original game offers tons of quests, a Main quest, 4 other majot quest line from different factions and tons of small side quests per major location.
3. DLCs change certain aspects of the game which made it look new to me.  More weapons, armor, enemies and brand new quests.  1 major quest for each DLC and tons of additional side quests.
4. Ease of adding mods makes this game infinitely great.  Want to make you character fart instead of shout?  There is a mod for that :)
5. Customization of characters gives you so many possibilities.  Want to be a destruction mage?  or a sneaky assassin? or an archer, or a brute force player who uses massive two handed weapons... or... or...  or all of the above?  all possible.
6. Price, the game is a few years old but for 20$ with all DLCs, its money well spent for countless hours of fun.  And if you add mods, it extends the game even further

Cons:
1. Some of dialog do not change even after significant events have happened.  Spoiler alert:  For example in the Companions, after finishing the quest line, and being declared as the ""harbinger"", the people still talk to you as a noob and still treat u as a noob and give you noob repeating quests.  Minor but kills story immersion.
2. Game balance.  At high levels, you can virtually kill anything in one shot even at the hardest setting because you can exploit certain skills to be that powerful, for example you can creation potions which gives you 20K% damage, or u can forge weapons that do this much damage.  But at low levels where u pretty much rely on weapons and armor u pick up, u die pretty much every step (at the highest difficulty) due to the huge power gap from u and similar level enemies.
3. Lots of bugs.  As can be expected from a huge game, but, some bugs from day of release are still here years after so they are likely to stay.  Luckily there are a lot of info on the web to overcome this especially for the PC version.  If you think some of the quest progression does not make sense, its likely you have hit a bug.

But despite this, overall great game. By itself, and even better game if u add some mods.  Fair warning, u will lose countless hours in this game for sure.","Easy math, 3 stand alone DLCs cost u 45$",1460505600,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

I've been burned out on just about all games for quite a while now. I decided to give NLF another chance and I'm glad I did. This is the first game I've finished in about two years. None of the others recently have been able to hold my attention. NLF did in spades.
The levels are desinged very well and none of them too complicated or too large. It's nice to be able to play for only 30-45 minutes and still make some head way. Granted if you have the time to do marathon sessions, NLF can definately keep you occupied. You don't have to lose contact with all your friends and family while you try to finish it though ( unless of course you want to ).
The graphics are very good and I've played on a few different systems. Granted a Celeron 400 w/ a TNT can't swing 1280 x 1024 and won't play any game at the resolution at an acceptable rate but even on a 400 640 x 480 and even 800 x 600 were playable. The game looks awesome at the higher resolutions if you have the hardware to run it.
I don't often comment on music in a game but in this case I will. I'd compare it to SSX for the playstaion 2. Besides sounding very very good, the music is dynamic. When you round a corner and get into a shootout with some gaurds, the music reflects this. The tempo becomes a bit faster and the horns sound more on edge. The music adds a lot to the game.
Over all this is a very good game. I was reminded a lot of half-life. There wasn't anything in the game that was stolen from half-life. I was reminded of half-life due to the very solid game play. I'd call this half-life with more personality and not so hard puzzles. Had this game come out 2 years ago this would be a ""break through 5 star you life will never be the same unless you own it game.""

2.0,False,"11 25, 2010",A1W18JD0GDZ6IL,B002BSA1C6,Public Enemy,"After 5+ years in development GT5 is finally out, and feels like a 5 year old game, way behind the curve.

Understand that im a huge GT fan, and this is not easy.

If you played GT4 you have played this game.

GRAPHICS: GT5 is basically GT4 with higher polygon cars. HD textures, i think not. The tracks feel like they were lifted straight from GT4, meaning that the trees are 2D, and the textures are flat, no grass, just a blanket of green. It just lacks behind all the other racers like NFS Shift and Forza 3.

A good comparison is the Nurbergring, Its very flat compared to other racers like NFS Shift, and Forza 3. This applies to almost all the tracks, i figured with such powerful hardware like the PS3, we would get highly detailed tracks with beautiful textures, but no. I kid you not when i say, GT5 tracks are just GT4 tracks in HD, flat textures and very disappointing.

GAMEPLAY: Once again, if you played a Gran Turismo game before, you played them all. What was once great 6 years ago, is not great anymore. What im talking about is the progressing system. There are no season in the game, you just pick a track and try to get to first place. There are levels now, meaning in order to do a certain cup, or a race, you have to be ranked a certain level. This really keeps you from doing higher level races when you feel you ready, and when you have a nice car.

This leads me into A.I. it just awful, if feels like im racing a bunch of zombies, again. The problem that GT4 had with its boring AI, has not been solved, but luckily one problem has been solved; the AI finally are aware that you exist and won't drive you off the road like in GT4.

This whole AI issue spills into other areas as well. When you are racing them, and you bought a fast car, the game does not scale the AI cars to relatively same lever cars as your, so your always end up being way ahead of them all, with no struggle or excitement of trying to get to the 1st spot... its just you, all by yourself, way way upfront. This has been common in all the Gran Turismo games, but you would think that with the 5th iteration the game would boast many improvement over the previous version, but no. The only thing they fixed is the AI being aware of you.

This is what bring me to the ""Way behind the curve"" part of my review. This games is just so outdated, i just can feel the ignorance fuming from this game. This game with its 5 years in development falls way behind Forza 3 and other racers like NFS Shift. It has no progression system, It has dumb boring A.I. What was once a staple in graphics and beautiful tracks, is now just flat boring port of GT4 tracks.

With its 5 year dev cycle, there has been 2 iterations of Forza series, and each one boasted huge improvement over the other, and had only a 2 year dev cycle each. What the heck were the Developers doing all that time, oh right, putting in boring cars.

1031 CARS: Yes, wow lots of cars... but you know what? most of them are just plain old boring, and there is a huge lack of American cars. The 1031 cars consist mostly of Hondas, Mitsubishis and other Japanese cars. There are NOT a lot of Lambos, or Ferraries. Want a Porsche? Foget about it Mario. I would not say there are a lot of exciting cars in GT5 when i compare it to Forza, Forza has cars that you actually wana race. Yes, Forza has so far 500 cars, but they are fully detailed and ALL OF THE CARS HAVE HIGHLY DETAILED INTERIORS, unlike the 200 ""premium"" Gran Turismo cars...

ONLINE: These days its a standard to have online capabilities to race other players around the world, but the Online in GT5 is terrible and confusing, there is a huge lack of options, and its just hard to figure it all out.

BOTTOM LINE. Im so mad at this game, 5 plus years in developtment, and you get Zombie AI, tracks that are very borring and Last Gen, Lack of none Japanies cars, No progression or seasons system. Its just the same old recycled game we have gotten before, but now with higher polygon system.

Its just a disappointment, i wish you readers knew how let down i feel.","A long wait, ends with a dissapointment.",1290643200,23,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

In sequential order, this would be the first game.  Im sure, by now, any GoW fan knows this, or has already played the game.

A couple of years later and you get a better game with better graphics.  IMO, this game has the best story of the franchise.  Very strong, very emotional, and very hard game to play.

I have an older desk, somewhat narrow, and with a large Samsung monitor on it there just is not room for this keyboard.  It extended over the edge of my desk by several inches.  I did not buy this as a gaming keyboard.

I constantly had problems with dropped letters or words, inconsistent connection.

I went through another 3 or 4 before I decided to invest in one I thought would last...

He had been asking for a mechanical keyboard for years.  He loved it, still does, so I thought I would look over the Razer keyboards for myself.  My needs are different than his.  I use mine mostly for writing, but wanted solid construction, backlighting and (unnecessary) but was very taken with the colors on the chroma.  Amazon had a sale on Razer keyboards and I got this one at a very nice price.
I think it is great  to type on, love the colors and found set up etc very easy.
At the same time I purchased the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corsair-K65-RGB-Keyboard-Cherry-Red/dp/B00P7Y4618/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corsair K65 RGB Keyboard - Cherry Red</a>&nbsp;which was also on sale albeit at twice the price, but it is mechanical, more solid (or so my son told me).  He loves Razer, but also prefers mechanicals to membrane keyboards.  I had read that the Corsair was difficult to program, and fully expected to be keeping the Razer and returning the Corsair, but one fit on my desk and the other didn't.
The Deathstalker also takes up only 1 usb port while the corsair uses 2.  Were it not for that wrist rest I would be keeping this keyboard.

Frankly, I HATE the wrist rest.  what is the point of a hard plastic wrist rest?  It might work for some, but.. why is it not removable like it is on the corsair?  I personally prefer both the beanbag wrist rest I am currently using and my old gel pads to the hard plastic extension on the Deathstalker.

Long story short, mom is learning programming again.  My son did offer to set it up for me, but I asked him how he would feel if I called him next year at CalTech to ask him how to reprogram my keyboard if I wanted a change.  LOL.

For others who might be looking at this as a standard keyboard for writing (but nicer than average) the 10 key rollover is a double edged sword.  I have never had to do so much editing: accidentally brush a key (or keys) and it is part of your document.

I am sure this is a terrific gaming keyboard, very fast, easy to set up and use, and Razer synapse is very simple.  Great hardware and software, but... be aware that the wrist rest makes this almost double the size of a standard keyboard, and it is not removable (as it is on the corsair) which is also a compact keyboard, and mechanical, and very durable.  For those who are comparing (and I know from reading reviews that a bunch of people are) the Corsair also has a more  solid build, or seems to.  The Corsair software is also not as hard to work with as you may have been led to believe, after all, mom can handle it.

4.0,False,"12 30, 2011",AN2WDDRGJTSML,B001CWXAP2,Jetpack,"TOR is an interesting game.  Now, of course, a review of an MMO this early is a bit useless, but I'll toss my thoughts in.  I can see the points of the entire gamut of reviews from 1 star to 5 (except for the sub. whining.  The horse left the barn in about 1997 on that one).  If you like an alt heavy, story driven game, and are OK with WoW style combat, you should like TOR.  If you are a heavy PvPer, crafter or single player character, then may not be your cup of tea.

I'm very much enjoying reading the story as it unfolds.  The voice acting is good, and I'm enjoying the quests.  Especially like the bonus quests that pop up.  The map turns transparent as you run, and the area loot option is great.  The game feels like Star Wars to me, so that's a huge bonus.

It's been easy to run duo's with my wife, so happy about that.  The game has done a good job of teaching us the ropes as we've gone, also.

Now, I'm not a PvPer, not since my DAOC days, so I'm not up to speed on that, but I've heard that it isn't working well.  If you are PvP heavy, I suggest doing more research first.

Haven't had an issue with the queues, as we picked two East Coast light servers.  Got the names we wanted also.

While this has been a great choice for us, it's really going to depend on what you want.  If you want PvP or SWG crafting, then TOR probably isn't for you.

We have encountered some bugs, and some lag issues, but that's a new MMO for you.  If that is a concern, definitely wait a few months.

Edit - they really do need to bump up the CSR support - the bugs and lag are building over time - hopefully they get that 9000 issue under control soon.

Edit 2 - I've run out of interest for now in TOR.  I lasted 3 months, but heading back to an old MMO.

The first thing I noticed was that the gameplay was barely improved from the 2010 version (I had recently played it in anticipation for this one). Better, but not significantly. However, the graphics are noticeably better.  In that moment, I would have given this 4 or 5 stars. Hours of gameplay later, I got to the final squad selector, where you choose your final squad. At this point I saved in case I want to play again later with a different squad. The first thing I noticed was that selector was ridiculously confusing, especially without a game manual. After 10 minutes of trying to figure it out, I finally was able to get a squad that I was okay with, although not necessarily happy with. So I advance to the final tournament. Now I have to set my lineup for the first match, but wait, where are the players I grudgingly accepted? Somehow, they got replaced by other completely random players. The starting 11 I had used through qualifying was there but my bench was different. Great! I've invested hours into qualifying and training to increase the form of players I planned on taking to the World Cup, many of whom I was unable to select in the final 23 selector.

5.0,True,"03 13, 2007",A1QV5459EXH96B,B0002XL3BA,A. Torres PR,"The greek culture and the stories acient greeks came up with to understand their existence fascinates me. God of War completely builds itself around that train of thought ancient greeks left behind. The Minotaurs,Cyclops, Cerberus, Zues, Hades, Poseiden, Athena, Satyrs, etc... All these things in this game make it seem like this was a story told long ago and made into a videogame. This game and  the upcoming God of War 2 which is released today will be the last great PS2 games to end the 6 year reign of the PS2.

What is it that gives this game good Marks.....Lets talk about creativity, character and story wise. Kratos is a fictional character created to further the history of ancient greeks. He is a fierce spartan warrior that has sold his soul to ARES, the god war, to maintain his prideful right as the most ruthless warrior. As told by ancient greeks, the Gods were tricky and ruthless themselves, also playing and manipulating the lives of humans. Naturally the same happens with Kratos where he is tricked throughout one of his battles for ARES and kills his Family Accidentally. ARES felt it was the best thing for him to do to throw out any feelings Kratos had so that he can be the ultimate warrior. From here we have an epic adventure involving you fighting legendary creatures told in Greek culture to exact revenge against ARES and if need it be as far as all the gods. The Creatures are so uniquely designed in this game and scaled massively at times that you'd swear thats how they looked if the Fictional ancient greece were real. The story mends all of these creatures together to form an all new story that can be thrown in with the rest of ancient greek documents and stories. The famous tale of the PANDORA's BOX is thrown in to further story and help you exact your revenge when the time comes. Two of the best created creatures was HYDRA and ARES themselves. Both look menacing and evil as the titles and stories put behind them. The enemies you fight were created well but you end up fighting them repeatedly throughout the game. One Character i found that wasn't repeated quite often were the ""Half Man/half Horse"" creatures(Sorry forgot the Name), if anything you saw them at least 3 times in the game.  Unfortunately their aren't alot of spectacular bosses in the game considering the many gods and creatures that ancient grecians mentioned in stories.

Gameplay was so simple and to the point. Controlling Kratos himself was with the Left analog stick, and the right analog stick were dodge moves. Combat was a matter of holding down some buttons and pressing others to form more combinations. As you leveled up, your blades of chaos and magic powers, you would get a list of even more button combinations to vary the combo ballet you would form.  Many combos existed but the one thing that looked a tiny bit awkward, to me, is that the combos looked as if they could not link fluidly. Their would be this split second where you could tell the computer had to pause kratos to start another combo but nonetheless everything responded very quickly. I just thought a game like this would have everything link 2gether to look more graceful. It was no bid deal anyway. Boss Fights were very limited to the same combos that were given, but when given the chance to grab on to a boss or an enemy the game would engage to a mini game, similar to the dance dance games, were you would have to press the correct button that lighted on top of the enemy. What would happen after every press of the button is a spectacular midair move to cause more damage to the enemy. But I often felt i wasn't doin much to the enemy but hurting him till he gets dizzy so i could grab him and do the same minigame. It wasn't annoyin but i thought it could have been more frantic and more involved. Unfortunatly the same minigame system has been kept in GOD OF WAR 2. Overall everything is top notch. The things i mention are just small quirky things that i noticed along with other people.

Puzzle wise, I found the game to be decently challenging and it did not need to be harder. Some people found the puzzle with the rotating spikes, in Hades, to be hard as hell. For me the thing was to keep moving and take advantage of every open spot that the spike Column would give me. Yea i fell plenty of times but I got it very quickly.

Difficulty on the game at the Hard level was ok. The only problem I had with the hard difficulty is the last fight with the copies of the multiple Kratos's to defend the wife and kid. Damn was that crap hard with the difficulty that high. After finally being able to beat it and putting it on God Mode, God mode was a cake walk till i got to that last level to defeat the multiple Kratos's. NOW I CANT BEAT THE DAMN LEVEL....LOL. SOME ONE HELP!

Other than that the game is solid. I think i touched on the fine points of the game on this review. I totally recommend this game along with GOD OF WAR 2. Get them both and play the last great games of the PS2. 5, 10, 20, 100 thumbs up.

The graphics are equilvant, if not better, and the idea for a 3D controller was neat. The problem with this system is GAMES! Nights into dreams, a port of 3D Blast, and a few others. They didn't even make a full Sonic game on it. Sonic 3D Blast and Sonic R don't count. They were developing a 3D Sonic game called Sonic Xtreme, but it was a disaster. It had already been moved from Genesis to 32X, and then the Saturn. The directors of the game were being switched constantly, the final one almost died from stress. At one point Xtreme was using the Nights Into Dreams 3D engine, but then they got in trouble for it and had to start from scratch. So Sega made a console and never had an actual Sonic game on it.

Shouldn't that be enough reason for ""Tales of"" fans to buy the game? In any case, this won't be much of a review if I just ended it there, so I'll continue:

This game probably has the best use for cel-shaded graphics for a next-gen game seeing as when I first saw the intro, I found it a bit hard to tell which is in-game graphics and which is an anime cutscene! Although that doesn't really hold much weight compared to the graphical prowess of other games, this is probably the only true demerit of the game, because otherwise, this is a magnificent game!

One thing that I feel the ""Tales of"" series has a definite edge over RPG series, it's the fun, real-time, combo-driven battle system. As mentioned in my other reviews of ""Tales of"" games, this is the series that makes me look forward to the next battle, and am intentionally going into one because of one thing that makes games something you look forward in playing: it's FUN! The heated, intense battles, the combos! The battle system for this game is the best and most refined of all the ""Tales of"" games too, given its status as its current flagship game of the series! This alone puts other RPGs to shame with their unexciting, boring battles that rely too much on flash and graphics (you know those games).

It's also quite a treat that the skits are now voiced! I actually love the skit system. It is a very interesting way to explain a lot of minor and a few major aspects of the story of each character, world, event, etc. without creeping into the main storyline's scenes themselves (seeing as they are optional to view). This both allows a person to understand more of the story or play through the game with little interruptions!

Speaking of the story, each character plays a major role to the story, unlike most games where the ""hero"" or ""heroine"" are the only ones that matter since the rest of the characters are extra fighting bodies that are just there. You definitely know something deep is rooted for each of your pary members, which makes the story fleshed out and gives this sense that you really need to know what's up and what's in store for everyone later.

Although story-wise, I'm not sure on whether Tales of Vesperia is better than Tales of the Abyss or vice-versa since I haven't finished Tales of Vesperia late (My 360 broke a couple of days before I got the copy mailed in to my house. Argh.). I still look forward to this game!

After having said what I think needed to be known, I could not contain my love for the series much longer! I LOVE THIS GAME! If I have all day, I'd lay back and play this game all day, just like I did with Tales of the Abyss! It's a no-brainer that ""Tales of"" fans should get! As for the rest of the fans, they simply could not do wrong on purchasing this game for their Xbox 360s! And for RPG fans who are planning to get a 360, this is the very first game you should get! Oh and be sure to get the Special Edition of the game if you can. You'll see later on heheh...

Did I mention before that I love this game? Magnificent!",This is the reason why the Xbox 360 got sold out in Japan!,1224115200,5,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

However, if you have the patience for that, there is a very worthwhile game in there. It is my feeling that good heavily outweighs the problems, and I continue to enjoy playing regardless of them. However, if you are a stickler for such issues I highly recommend picking this title up at a later date after the developers have had a chance to repair some of these issues - possibly a few months from now or when the new installments of Reel Deal games come out in September. I would point out that there are no problems with the offline game, only the online MMO play.

This game is slots only, no casino table games. (For those you will need to additionally pick up Reel Deal Millionaire's Club). The Reel Deal games have the best slots I've ever seen in a video game, and are better than many brick and mortar casino games. 2 new ones are available for download every month also, to add to your collection. The art for the slots is top notch, and the bonus rounds play out as fun minigames.

Online you can participate in a 3D casino MMO world where you create an avatar, walk around, play the games, level up, and get rewarded for your experience earned. It's as close to going to a real casino as you're going to get right now on a video game, and without having to spend your real world cash.

If you want a slot game, this is the one to get. If the technical problems are an issue for you, either wait to buy or plan to play offline only for a while.","Has problems, but good outweighs the bad",1236729600,,,

If nothing else, Taiketsu succeeds somewhat in capturing the simple visual charm of the show. The large characters look clear and visible on the tiny GBA screen, but overall they can't compete with the superior graphics of GBA champions MK:DA and Street Fighter, and Taiketsu's herky-jerky animation is also particularly distracting. To save battery juice, go ahead and mute the muffled background music and scratchy sound effects-since the game lacks character voices, you won't miss anything important. Taiketsu's button-mashing gameplay is shallow and simplistic, even for a kid's fighting title. There are 15 characters total, including favorites from both the series (like Cell and Goku) and the movies (including the popular Brolly). Aside from the occasional super-move, each character boasts only a meager handful of attacks and combos. Worse, there's very little difference between the various fighters. Players can also occasionally take to the skies during combat, but that gimmick burns out quickly. On the plus side, the game thoughtfully includes several play modes (like Tournament and Endurance) to help extend the replay value; unfortunately, none of the game types are interesting or particularly enjoyable. Another nice touch is the Soul Calibur-esque secret system, which allows players to earn Z Points to unlock bonus modes, settings, and pictures.

 First off, let me say that this is the only Final Fantasy game I EVER RETURNED! Thats right, i keep all my games, even the average ones. This one however I had to return due to its ""piece of junk-ness"".

 FF 10-2 revolves around a trio of girls, 2 of which were characters in the previous FF 10 game. They go off on their adventures doing this, doing that, and in general, you don't really know quite what they are doing. Unlike regular Rpg's where you have a story, and a plot, this game sorta starts with you in your little flying ship able to go everywhere. Its like gigantic minigame. The places you go to don't really have any story, you just land at place A, fight monsters, get some item, and your done. Saying this, there are some awesome mini-games in FF 10-2, which was surprising since most recent Final Fantasy games have failed with minigames.

 Now, onto the irritating part. You get to play 3 girls as characters. 3 annoying, teenie-bop girls. Girls who are what, late teens? Except they act like they are 9. They run about saying ""oh poo"" and other similiar phrases. Plus they take baths in skimpy underwear, and massage other girls, and walk about in thongs and skin tight outfits. MMM as a 40 year old gamer, I immensely enjoyed it (NOT!). The game looks like it programmed by experienced Japanese gamers, but created by their 9 year old daughters, and designed by their 11 year old horny sons. To gain abilities and powers you have to change into outfits. Thats right, you change your girl's clothes to gain abilities. And each outfit is tighter and more revealing than the last.

  The game looks beautiful, definitely as great or better graphics as FF 10. But thats all the game excel's at, graphics. No plot, no story, very very bad dialogue and character development (unless you count bra's and thongs as development). There are some very good minigames, and of course the grapics look stunning (did i say that already?). But if you aren't a 11 year old kid, you will hate this game. I couldn't even push my way through the dumb parts, I got disgusted with the game half way through and had to return it for something decent.",Oh what a letdown from FFX,1200009600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Here's a simple pro/con to help you out:

Pros:

1. Great graphics

2. Plays basically like its larger counterparts

3. It's a lot of fun, once you get the hang of the controls

4. The story basically follows the console verions (i.e. it's good)

5. The multiplayer is fun (if you have someone to play with)

Cons:

1. Graphics, although impressive, aren't the fastest-it's playable (although you probably won't be using the thermal goggles much, the night vision is o-k)

2. The lack of a ""knockout"" or real knife attack (you can only cut throats after you grab someone)-it would've sped up the gameplay a little, but I can see why the developers would want to keep the pace of this game a little slower-it's a handheld game! Lots of grabbing isn't that bad anyway-plays much like  the first game!

3. The controls do take a little getting used to-but after going through the training mission 2 or 3 times and playing the first level, which is fairly easy, I felt like I was playing Splinter Cell on my xbox-the controls are intuitive enough, once you get the hang of them.

4. All text-no speech in game It can be a little annoying, but I know the voices from the console so I just read the lines in my head with their voices and it seemed basically the same

All in all, i would strongly recommend this game as it really is fun and the main problem most have with it, the framerate, is NOT as bad as it seems and is quite playable.

1.0,False,"03 4, 2007",AXKULY1DUDE3N,B000B43OY4,mg111,"I bought this console 7 months ago and it has had mild to moderate use. It probably gets played or used three to four times a week including gaming and DVD use.

As a whole my impressions were that it was somewhat mediocre. I had heard about how loud a console it was and all of the issues with overheating and would say both are true.

Gameplay is pretty good but in my opinion the number of games which sport both excellent gameplay and excellent graphics are fairly anemic. Instead I've seen too many games that look great but just don't live up to expected standards of gameplay, frame rate, realism, etc. However with Rainbow Six and the Call of Duty series providing some fun I rated the console a two in this area.

Now for my real issues with the console. After 7 months a red light began blinking on the console and an error message reporting the console required service appeared on my television. Called customer service and was told to unplug it, this despite telling the ""technician"" what the message said and the corresponding instructions in the manual. Nonetheless I tried it and as expected the problem continued. Good news though, its under warranty. I only have to wait a week for them to send me an empty box to pack it in and an authorization number. Then I get to wait an additional 4-6 business days for them to repair it, then an additional week for them to return it. Yes essentially a refurbished machine that was flawed to begin with so it can fail again in 6 months - after the warranty has expired.

The bottom line: Microsoft is clueless and a bunch of crooks. They released a product that they knew had problems. They've been in the software industry since the 80's and therefore should understand product development and therefore had to have been aware that the size of the processor was not adequately cooled by the machine. Yet they did nothing and continue to do nothing to rectify the problem.

Furthermore, Microsoft has been promoting this product as a ""media center"" for your home. So I'm supposed to be without my ""media center"" for three weeks because they build inferior products. In addition, this media center has been touted as being superior to the playstation3 and so much less expensive. Well here's the next suprise. If you purchase it it will support high-def gaming, but this fabulous ""media center"" doesn't support high-def DVD. You have to spend an additional $199 to get that feature making the total system cost $598. Playstation 3 comes with blu-ray (high-def) capabilities built in at $599. Furthermore it would appear that the HD DVD format is not going to survive and that Blu-ray is likely to become the medium of choice. So while Microsoft has been berating the price of the competitor's system and promoting their own as this great media or home entertainment center they've been peddling an inferior product.

In general I'm greatly disappointed. I purchased an extended warranty for the product when I purchased it and have been given the option of getting a new system or store credit. I'm undecided whether to get another one or take the credit because I've invested in several games at quite an expense and after only seven months I was hoping that the software makers would continue to improve their products. However for someone contemplating a purchase I would recommend waiting a year or so until all flaws are worked out and it becomes clear whether playstation will establish themselves as the leading system and then purchase a plystation 3.",Do NOT buy this console!!!,1172966400,7,{'Edition:': ' Pro Console 20GB'},

But it is pretty cute!  I've been a video game fan for years and since the beginning of Nintendo in the 1980's, Luigi hasn't really had his own video game before.  It seems Mario is always the star.  Mario is the main character, Mario rescues the princes, get's the girl and Luigi is always player number two, with the exception of Mario Brothers 2, where you can pick Luigi as your Main Character.  But for the most part, poor Luigi has always been shoved off to the side.

Not this time!  This time, Mario has gotten himself in some deep stuff and needs rescued himself!  That's right, Mario has been captured by the ghosts and it's up to my Main Man Luigi to save the day.  You guide Luigi through the mansion, sucking up ghosts Ghostbuster style.  I'll admit, this game can be quite difficult and it took some time to finish.  You're in a mansion and several doors are locked.  It can be tricky finding your way around, even if you do have your map.  Many of the ghosts can be difficult, too.  Before you can even fight a ghost, you have to figure out a way to bring it out of hiding and fight you.  Finding the exact procedure to get the ghost to come out and fight you can be hard to figure out and battling the ghost can be difficult as well.

The game is very similar to D2 and, in my opinion, that's a good thing. I remember late nights at college when I needed to be studying but D2 kept sucking me back in. There was something addicting about magic finding and trading with other players. Unfortunately, I haven't been bitten by the D3 bug (yet). It just doesn't have that same luring nature.

Another drawback is the game already feels outdated. If you've been spoiled by cutting-edge titles, such as Skyrim, with gripping graphics and riveting story lines, you'll get the sense that D3 was released too late. Don't get me wrong: it certainly looks better than D2, but not by a whole lot.

I'm not going to knock Blizzard for the launch issues. Obviously, I believe they should have done a better job preparing for the mass number of users but I can understand there are limits to server hardware.

Pros:
- Amazingly fast and efficient UI. Much like its predecessor, the XMB, it's neat, organized, and even easier to navigate.
- Boot up speed has never taken more than 15 seconds (from a ""cold boot""). I could immediately jump into a game right after boot up.
- Wonderful controller; the DualShock 4 serves as a complete improvement over the DualShock 3, brimming with neat new features!
- Ventilation is powerful, and noise from the fans are very low (much quieter than my PS3 Slim). Even disc reading sounds are  noticeable only upon initial load-up, and unnoticeable shortly thereafter.
- Using the mono headset plugged into the DualShock 4, voice commands worked flawlessly despite my horrible diction. [worked just as good with a PlayStation Camera that I bought separately]
- Knack is a simple, straight forward game reminiscent of the classic PS1 games, but also leaves a very welcome challenge for those who try out the time trial mode and play the more difficult modes.

Cons:
- Although insignificant, the disc was loose inside the Knack case. However, the disc did not get scratched, and the game played with no errors.
- The 30 day Music Unlimited voucher code did not work for me, but the PlayStation Plus 30 day and $10 PSN credit voucher codes worked fine.
- Only froze once, while updating Warframe.

Although a very young system at the date of writing this review (only a week old), the PS4 is an excellent system and I couldn't be happier owning an outstanding piece of PlayStation history thus far. I feel very optimistic about this system's future and the potential features that will be added to the system software, such as system theme features (like the dynamic themes for the XMB on PS3), more intricate voice commands for launching games and applications, etc.

5.0,False,"12 4, 2012",ANJP63IOCGMNQ,B00007KUU8,Smolderin&#039; Stu,"""Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty"" is the PlayStation 2 sequel, released in 2001, to the critically acclaimed ""Metal Gear Solid"". Following the groundwork laid by the previous game, ""Sons of Liberty"" continues to provide a heavily cinematic experience with the same unprecedented gameplay.

Immediately noticeable is the vast amount of detail to graphics (at least for the time on the current console). The game's framerate stays consistent, and models and environments are smooth, with little to no graphical issues. The musical score, composed by Harry-Gregson Williams and Norihiko Hibino, is outstanding, with a contrast between symphonic and orchestral arrangements for cutscenes, and industrial and ambient tracks for in-game music.

The gameplay has evolved from what the original ""Metal Gear"", and even ""Metal Gear Solid"", used to be. The game plays similarly to the top-down view of the previous entry, but uses a lot of different angles for each area of the game. It retains the stealth element, encouraging sneaking through the levels without anyone noticing, and enforcing harsh consequences to those who happen to get caught. Enemy AI is smart and consistent, reacting to even the slightest noise or strange sight. They're also a bit more realistic than before; instead of Alert Mode activating immediately when caught, guards have to call for back-up, which gives you ample time to react and hinder, or possibly altogether stop, their progress. Guards are viscously brutal and tactical during Alert Mode, so much so that even the smartest player will have a tough time taking them down or even escaping them.

The game's story initially revolves around Solid Snake, but quickly switches it's focus to an original character named Raiden for the majority of the game. While a great deal of Metal Gear fans were upset by this, Raiden proves to be a interesting character on his own, backed by a tremendous voice cast and great supporting characters. The story contains many elements, such as betrayal, censorship, mind control, and conspiracies, with a constant, looming feeling that everything isn't what it appears to be. The game has a lot of backstory, and even tends to discuss future possibilities quite often. As the story progresses, old characters meet up with new ones, and the story manages to stay strong with a good balance of long, dramatic cutscenes and exciting stealth gameplay.

The attention to detail in this game is astonishing. There are thousands of small things that make the game so realistic, even by today's standards: Snake/Raiden can catch a cold which will cause them to sneeze, capturing guards' attention; laying across a pile of bugs for a while will eventually cause them to enter your inventory and slowly consume rations; the contents that come from shooting a fire extinguisher or even a bag of flour can reveal infrared lasers; you can hinder guards in many different ways, such as shooting their limbs to prevent them from shooting, or busting their radios to prevent them from calling for back-up; you can complete the game without using lethal force against anyone -- the list goes on and on. This game has so many possibilities that most designers today wouldn't even consider putting some of them in a game.

Concerning the re-release, ""Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance"", it contains the original game while including extra content. This content includes a variety of Virtual Reality missions (ranging from sneaking to photography), Snake Tales (new side-missions involving Snake in the areas of the game he wasn't in before), and a skateboarding mini-game (based on the company's game Evolution Skateboarding). The VR Missions are plentiful and extremely challenging, therefore offering a fair amount of replay value. The Snake Tales are also challenging, and are interesting what-if scenarios involving Snake in missions that take place throughout nearly the entire game with plenty of different challenges. The skateboarding mini-game, however, is confusing, frustrating, and extremely linear. It has several different goals, but the entire mini-game has a time limit; abysmal controls do nothing to help. Overall, this is pretty much the same package as ""Sons of Liberty"". Those with the original probably shouldn't feel out of place without it, but those who don't have either would probably be better off to pick up ""Substance"", as the majority of the extra content is worthwhile (if possible, I would recommend ""Metal Gear Solid: HD Collection"" for the best version of ""Metal Gear Solid 2"").

""Sons of Liberty"" isn't the longest game ever made, but the engrossing and extremely emotional story combined with varied gameplay makes this a revolutionary title. The story is exceptional by itself, but Hideo Kojima, creator and writer of the Metal Gear series, has gave it a life of it's own. With so much focus on government distrust, anti-war sentiments, personal freedom, and many other controversial elements, it feel's like a revelation; one that can open a players eyes to outstanding issues even outside of the game. It doesn't feel preachy or biased, but informative. I'm sure I've forgotten many things I wanted to mention, but this game has an abundance of content for having a linear style. In conclusion, ""Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty"" is even more of an accomplishment than it's predecessor, as it improves on all of the previous elements and provides many new features that push the game to it's limit. It stands the test of time, as it's enjoyable today as much as it was when it was first released. This game is truly a work of art.",A masterpiece,1354579200,,,

But, something about it stuck with me and I bought a copy recently and have been playing it.

First off, the music and atmosphere are fantastic.  Games don't usually have this atmosphere that sucks you in and keeps you interested, and Persona 2 pulls off the dark atmosphere very well.

Second, if you've ever played an RPG before, you know you get into battles.  But, when is the last time you've entertained a demon and got him to make a contract with you, or give you items in the middle of a battle?  That's just the kind of oddity that makes this game great.  It doesn't stop there of course.  No, you can have demons give you tarot cards, you can summon them later, have them give you information etc... it's all very detailed.

The cities and people are also pretty expansive.  It's one of those video game landscapes so large you almost don't want to waste the time checking everything out... this is where Persona 2 shines.  It's very odd and fascinating so you want to see it all no matter how much time you've already spent.

2.0,False,"08 19, 2010",A1MB5HUA3WYEJC,B000RVB3XK,Mike,"After many years in development and missed release dates, Rig n Roll was finally released. With a passing interest in truck driving, tycoon genre, and/or simulation, 18 Wheels of Steel fans (who might be disappointed with the way Extreme Trucking direction went and for those looking for something more than American Long Haul) may see this as a challenge to the truck driving sims namely the 18 Wheels of Steel franchise. It's  a different take on a business sim/trucking game. I was a fan of all the 18 Wheels of Steels games with the exception of Extreme truckers ( because of its new direction which I didn't like) and Big City Rigs which was just god-awful!

Rig n Roll was billed as a truck driving sim tycoon game taking place only in the state of California with one city in Nevada. You are a truck driver for a company that you own.  You choose what to haul as there are different types of goods ranging from fruit to cars. You start off with a basic rig that you can upgrade. At your company, you can also tradein your truck for a much better one.  For the most part, all of this takes place in California. On a side note, it looks like Las Vegas (in Nevada) might be added in the Fall as some billboards on the freeways are hinting. The Rignroll, website still hasn't been updated since the game was released. This drives me insane as I would like to know if there are any updates and possible add-ons. You have to dig to find out that Las Vegas is in the works but no release date has been set. The graphics look very nice. The billboards look nice and realistic as do the roads also. You even have to play a toll at the Bay Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge; nice touch! I think I read when this game was in development, the game designers/developers went to California and mapped out the roads and drew the scenery. The developers of Wildlife Park 2 did the same thing (obviously at a zoo instead). Very nice! There is an interesting storyline in RignRoll with some interesting twists and turns. I won't divulge on it because I don't want to spoil it!

The graphics are very nice. I would say, better than the 18 WoS franchise. The streets, freeways, interstates look good. The map is not a good tool as it's not helpful (not useless, just not helpful. In 18 WoS; the map was terrific. In RnR,  I found myself on dead ends which the map never hinted to. The same issue in 18 WoS Haulin and American Long Haul persists in Rig n Roll; empty cities with no people. There is a glaring omission in RnR. I cannot understand, comprehend, or understand why! WHERE ARE THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS? A game with nice graphics and designers who drive around California to map out the land, you would expect the traffic lights (as well as different types/shapes). I couldn't believe it. This makes for interesting intersections. No stop signs either. The rigs are nice and lifelike. A nice touch is when you go to a gas station (press enter when there) you get out of your rig and pump (as well as use a slider to either fill it up or as much as you want). The downside is that you have no control of your character, it's automatic. You can customize your rig (paint, engine, brakes, wheels, etc. The only place to accept a job is in the warehouse. Your company must have a contract with the warehouse you are at, or else you can't start a job such as hauling a harvester, rocket fuel etc. Some jobs involves you being in a race to a designated city (warehouse). Usually it's against 4 other rigs (the AI). When you reach the border (fence) of a warehouses, it is automated (very disappointing to see). You watch the rig (with or without cargo) automatically be driven into the warehouse and a crane automatically unhooks your load. Why can't I drive in the warehouse, perhaps get out, and use a crane to unhook my load? When you pick your job, the load is automatically placed on your rig and you are automatically driven out. You have to be careful, because when you reach the boundary of the warehouse you are on your own and sometimes if you aren't paying attention you could quickly crash. By the way, if you crash, there are nice visuals of your rig taking damage. Your rig looks hurt! Also, why in the world is there a key for, unhooking or hooking your load? You don't even get to attach (or detach) it to your rig. If you crash and your trailer falls off, that's one reason. Also, from time to time, you might get a phone call asking you to pick up a trailer. On your jobs screen, it does tell you how to get to your destination.

The traffic is nice. Strange that California is known for it's traffic, yet it seems very quiet in the game, no matter what time of the day that it is. To get the true California traffic, you need to move the traffic slider all the way right (yes there is a slider for traffic in the menu. The day/night timing is a nice touch. The police are weird. If you commit a infraction, it seems like the police always try to run you off the road, however, if you slow down, you get pulled over and arrested....almost always. I did drive on the wrong side of the road not knowing a police cruiser was behind me and I was ticketed. So that's good, not everytime is an arrest :) Driving is more real in RnR than the 18 WoS series. But, at least in the 18 WoS series, you back up at your destination and unload your cargo. In RnR, you either go to a designated spot (along the road) and unhook the trailer (while going (under 10mph) or reach the warehouse where you rwach the warehouse border and it's completely automated.

All and all, this is game is about 2.7 stars. You wonder with it in development for so long, you think, ""this is it?"" If this game improves, I would change this rating (simply by erasing this review and redoing it. As of right now, the best thing to do is to try the demo first. There is no life in the cities and when you reach your destination, it's pretty much automated; everything is almost automated. It is a nice touch to be able to get out of  your truck and go into a diner, pump gas, fix your truck, and go to a motel. The only problem is that all of this is automated. you have no control (you have the option to fill as much gas as you need in your rig; it's a slider). The truck stops are nice but they are devoid of any action/people/other trucks in real time. At the truckstop, you can go into the diner and find work in the newspaper. When you play this game, you'll feel like this could of been a hit but it is a miss. Maybe in the future, if this game is supported, it could be a hit. Right now, it's got a lot of options to grow on and hopefully, it's supported. If you love truck sims, try the demo first. It might seem terrible at first, then it grows on you. I'm very close to erasing this review and upping the rating to about 3 stars although, as I said before, it's not quite there. If it's true, Las Vegas will be added, I will see how that goes as well as if anything else is added, ie. fixes, updates etc.

+ Scenery is very nice (better than 18 WoS)
+Truck interior and animations are nice
+Truck interior view is very nice/more accurate
+Cities don't all look the same
+Traffic is more realistic during the times of the day
+The AI won't crash into you, you have to be aware
+The police will pull you over if you commit a infraction if they are driving behind you. The police aren't static, they drive around.
+Good amount of cargo to haul
+Story mode is interesting
+Tutorial is nice
+Dolby Surround sound is nice
+ Guess what? When you drive up to a toll booth; you have to pay!
+The Truck Stops look very nice
+Good amount of options when upgrading your truck
+The radio is a nice touch; music actually isn't bad. I was tired of hearing,"" Anyone got the 10-13??"" (from 18 WoS)
+ How fellow employees, businesses contact you and the talking business is a nice touch
+ The animation when filling your tank, going to the motel, getting something to eat, fixing/upgrading your truck is nice as is the animation of how your truck looks if you get into a crash
+ steering is more realistic
+shifting/use of clutch/going in reverse is more realistic
+ The truck stops are nice
+ Besides going to the warehouse, you can go to a truckstop and get out of your truck to go into a bar/diner to find jobs in the newspaper.

- I've been to several cities and I have seen absolutely no traffic signals. California with no traffic signals???? Very careless.
-The cities are void of people.
- Reaching your destination, at the warehouse is automated. You don't back your rig to the loading/unloading zone. When you reach the border of the warehouse, you are automatically taken in, point and click what you want to haul, and the trailer is automatically attacked to your rig.
-sometimes when your task sends you to a specific location (not the warehouse), the directions are very vague. Sometimes you have to pick up the trailer on the side of a freeway but you will not know specifically where until it pops up on the right side of your screen.
- Would be nice if you can actually drop off goods and pick up goods at the seaport and airport.
-Realism- No speed limit signs on the freeway
- The journal, info screen is not very helpful
- Would be nice to be able to control your character: pumping fuel, washing your rig, sleeping in a motel, talking to other truckers at a diner/restaurant, unloading/loading trailers in the warehouse or pickup point.
- Sometimes you can get arrested for what seems to be minor infractions",Could of been a hit!,1282176000,32,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Ryse is by far the most gorgeous game I've seen so far on the next gen consoles. I feel this game is a perfect example of being a demo for the Xbox One. This game feels like it was made specifically for launch to show off what the Xbox One can do. A very short game with very repetitive gameplay. I'm actually kind of glad it was so short, as the game was far too repetitive for me to want it to continue further than it did. The story was interesting, but nothing amazing. The combat system felt like a poor man's version of the popular batman arkham series but with the addition of visually stunning and gruesome executions. If you felt the arkham series combat was repetitive and disliked it, you'll HATE this game for it.

Game was short, done maybe in about 5-6 hours. Story was entertaining enough to bear thru the game's repetitiveness, but not long enough to get emotionally invested into the game.

The graphics are a big difference which is always a plus. The controls are the same with classic nothing changes. Passing in the game still sucks as last year which i hope that gets finally fixed. I aim and press everything correctly and it passes somewhere completely different, but you learn how to adjust and get pass that.

The really downfall of Fifa recently for me IMO is that this moving away from a sports game and becoming more of a strategic game when it comes to free kicks, corns, penalty kicks etc. You now have to learn how to kick the ball pressing a combination of buttons to get it to do what you want, i understand where EA is going to make this look and feel more realistic but people just want to play a football and enjoy it. Not get stressed out because they can't get to figure out how to do a curved corner kick. That is my only con for this game.

Also one thing i think needs to be balanced its the whole FUT. It's crazy the amount of money people ask for certain cards, again you want to create a team and have fun, yes make it a bit difficult but when every Spanish player in La Liga cost over 30k is a bit ridicules which is why i didn't get the deluxe version this year and holding back on FUT.

There are smart enemies, who take cover, outflank your position and take over machine gun nests when their buddies get hosed. There are dynamic environments and fully fleshed-out battlefield environments, with tanks, planes, mortar shells and such. In features it outdoes other shooters at their own game.
There are drawbacks, though - the enemies are sometimes _too_ smart. They always know where you are and when you're going to stick your head out. There are missions where you're given a silenced pistol with nowhere to use it, as cover-or-no-cover the Nazis spot you blocks away & start shooting.  ""Frontline"" could have taken a page from ""Metal Gear Solid 2"" here. Another problem is typical of shooters; although the first few levels are blissfully open, eventually the game descends into ""tunnel-shooter syndrome"",  where the only way to go is forward, through piles of enemies, until you get to the end of the tube.

I tried everything from a fan blowing on it to alot of other crazy contraptions I thought up in my head.  One day I saw this and thought...  well if it doesn't work...  I can just send it back.

I also want you to know that I did something a little different than most.  I purchased a thermometer for a fish tank (the sticky strip ones you put on the outside of the tank) and put it on the XBox 360 near the top on the outside of the unit by the CD Tray.  My reason for this is because the CD's were coming out RED HOT!

This test is without the cooler.  I started up my XBox 360 at a room temperature of 68 on the thermometer and within 15 minutes the XBox had a tempurature or over 100 degrees farenheit!  The air coming out the back was just swealtering hot and the back (underside) was almost too hot to touch.

Now a test with the Glow Stand Cooler with Fans.  I started it up and it had a room temperature of 68 again and in 15 minutes...  it was only at 72!!!  Not only that but it stayed there the entire time I played for over 2 hours!  The air coming out the fans in the back was mildly warm as was the backside of the unit!  When I took out the CD it was luke warm at best!  Does this unit work?  You bet it does!  Intercoolers (first or second generation) are harmful to your XBox 360.

5.0,False,"02 2, 2010",A3TP31S61PPE3G,B002CZ71SU,AlexJouJou,"Although on the surface this game looks to be a direct Puzzle Quest Challenge of the Warlords (PQ or PQCOW) clone there are actually many differences once you play the game for a while. The actual puzzle gameplay is different--this one is more of a blocks falling Tetris feel. It is not a match 3. It is a match 4 game but with several twists. Admittedly much of the rest of it will feel familiar with a few slight alterations but there is an element of freshness here. That's a great thing!

In the game the most common puzzles are either dropping blocks (create match 4's underneath before the space fills up) or the grid based (sideways ""drop"" of blocks). You can grab the 3 unit big block (they are mixed so it might be all one color, one regular block, one rage block, one wildcard block, and so on to many many combos). You then go right with it, or let it make its way right, and you try to arrange blocks so you get things like 4 of a kind which turns into one giant block of goodness that (once it gets full energy/power) lets you release an action (spell, rage, etc). In effect like the spells in Puzzle Quest. This part is actually pretty basic as you are trying to push the mid point of the grid over to your opponents side. Like tug of war. Eventually if you are good enough it will move over and he won't be able to get any more blocks out and you win. Victory! I'm not good at describing puzzle gameplay so you might want to watch a video of the gameplay to get an idea.

I will say I am still figuring out exactly the effects of certain things like weapons and armour and accessories. I think they have an effect but because of the way the game continues and you do not get any break to think it's hard to pay attention to both the regular block gameplay and all the other pieces. IMHO it is more complicated than PQ COW because in that game you could pause to think about what move you wanted--there is no pause in this game which creates a different feel to the action. The blocks do not stop coming nor do they wait for you!

Graphically it reminds me of manga or anime or comics. Exagerated features and lots of line shading creates some sharp angles. No voice acting. When you start your hero (I got the guy..not sure there is a girl as I was only offered a boy. BOO on this--I want a GIRL hero!)has very minimal things on. As you add equiptment he gets outfitted. It's quite hilarious to watch him fight in battle with the items (albiet very small) and see him on the top screen with all the items you've equipped--particularly as they are often brightly colored--and they don't all match. So there is a kind of thrift store look to him but with higher class weaponry LOL. You do get a war beast early on to help you fight and you can train him up with a falling blocks game to make him have certain characteristics. It is very similar to your mount in the PQCOW game.

Music is good. However there are some hiccups between scenes where the music abruptly cuts off and takes a few seconds to shift. There isn't a real pronounced lag but you'll notice it. There are lots of loadings screens--not as much as something like Galactrix but more than other games of this type. The game also has auto save and it does that frequently. Overall the mood of the music is appropriate. I really like the battle tunes.

You won't have any problem figuring out where to go and what to do. It's very linear. There are a nice set of tutorials you can do first that are very helpful. That's good because the manual is pathetic. Konami should know better.

Difficulty level is a bit uneven. I am playing on casual (easy) and it is very easy. Because I want a before bed relaxing experience that is o.k. with me. I've not lost any battles yet. I did try on medium and lost several battles -- now I am not that great at the whole Tetris falling blocks type puzzles -- I prefer the more match 3 type puzzles so I can't say that this is indicative of how it would be for you (unless you don't do well at the falling blocks one either!). I would think most could play on either casual or medium--and you can switch it if you like as well--very comfortably. Medium has some extra drops. There are harder settings but like I said I play to relax-I likely won't ever both with those and can't review them. Someone who is far better at these types of games than I can have that honor!  Edited to Add: I've been playing on Medium lately. It does stretch out the battles a little and they are more challenging. I've got the hang of it now though and I seldom get defeated. I think Medium is completely doable for a play through.

As for the story--well it is all right--all dialogue is in the form of boxes and it is very bare bones. So if you want to play a very character based game you should opt for something else--this one has enough to move the story but the driving action force is really the puzzle fun. Basically (at least as far as I am) you are working on finding your lost villagers who seem to have been raided/sold into some sort of slavery. Along the way other interesting characters join you but, to date, I have not noticed that they have a huge effect on battle. Not like your companions can in the original PQ.

My bottom line: I really waffled on a 4 or 5 star rating--in reality I would say 4.3 or maybe 4.5 or so. I rounded up because, after several days of playing, I'm finding myself picking it up every night for that 1/2 hr to 1 hour before bed. That tells me it is addictive enough for me to continue to be charmed by it.

If I had to rate the PQ type games (RPG/Puzzle hybrid's) I'd say the original PQ Challenge of the Warlords along with the Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes are still best followed by this one and then Puzzle Kingdoms from last year. PQ Galactrix would come in dead last due to all its issues. While it does lack some of the charm of the original PQ Challenge of the Warlords and, on the whole, it feels about 1/2 a grade below that game, it is still loads and loads of addictive fun. And, after all, is that not why we play puzzle games?","Very fun, very addictive and not a complete PQ clone",1265068800,23,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo DS'},

1.0,True,"04 16, 2010",A1B0ZF5BUDA1QT,B000UZVLBW,Swamiji CH,"The XBox360 version, of Anniversary, started out pretty well, but quickly went downhill.  First, a key movement required to procure one of the treasures, simply does not work.  Fine.  So, keep on, keepin' on, and go to the next.  So, when the next level comes up, the first thing to happen is an attack by a very large bear.  On the screen, is a help line that comes up (halting the game play), explaining how to do a dodge --and, in turn, an adrenalin head shot.  When the text goes away, I immediately try the key sequence required ...and it, too, does not work!  That being said, I tried playing, several times, the same sequence, as well as a couple others requiring that same sequence ...and in ALL CASES, the required key sequence does not work.  Consequently, the bear bests/dinasaur (or whatever else) best lara ...game over.  Or, if one is persistent --and has a chance-- one can run past the bear and keep on keeping on ...for awhile, at least.  (Not past the dinasaur, however.  One MUST best the dinasaur to continue the game ...so, game TRULY over, in just a short while, with many levels left to play.)

Comes a pole, in the next segment, which Lara is supposed to climb.  She first jumps onto the cement base, out of which the pole emerges, and climbs.  Right?  Nope... not gonna happen.  Lara performs the classic 'I'm not supposed to do that' jump, and she goes past the pole, ten or fifteen times.  Finally, she lands on the base, and when the key is pressed for the climb... she does the 'I'm not supposed to do that' jump.

Having tried, several times, to get past the first couple segments, I have finally given up.  I have to say that this is the worst Tomb Raider I have ever attempted to play.  The second-worst, is 'Underworld', which begs another scathing review, unfortunately, because of several bugs.

Poor programming, apparently, since I have raided since Tomb Raider 2, and had little trouble compared to the latest Xbox releases.  All others, were for PC.  I think that's it, for my brand new Xbox.  I thought it would be less expensive than getting a computer to play these new ones, but I was incorrect.  I sense that it isn't Xbox's fault, since Legend is the ONLY one that works the way it is advertised, to work.  At least, on that one, the only broken sequence is, guess what!?: The dodge/adrenalin head shot.  All else, works.

4.0,False,"08 17, 2009",A31QHSQO12Z33L,B001AWIP68,IJ+,"I think that this game is so much fun and it shows that Treyarch really knows that they had to step it up to keep up with Infinity Ward on these games. What I would have recommended is that this came before Modern Warfare because there wouldn't have been the disappointment that Call of Duty was going back to WWII. Although it was a disappointment that Call of Duty went back to WWII, they did not disappoint with the quality of the game.

They made the missions continuous with 2 different views of the war fighting as either a Russian fighting the Germans or an American fighting the Japanese. Each mission had various stories and different guns and objectives. Whether the mission was hiding and playing ""cat and mouse"" trying to use a sniper to kill a person in another building, or going full out force with tanks, each mission keeps you wanting more. It took me a little while to finish the game, but not as long as some other games (which is known for the Call of Duty series.)

The thing about this game that really gets me is the multiplayer modes. In this game, there is cooperative and competitive campaigns so you can play all the missions from the game with up to 3 other people so instead of making someone watch you play, they can play alongside with you. You can also do that online with 3 other people (its an xbox achievement...hint, hint!) What I thought was very creative about this game is the Nazi Zombies mode, which is when you are trapped and it is the zombie apocalypse and you try to fight off the zombies while getting points for killing nazi zombies and boarding windows. You can then get weapons to kill them faster. As levels get higher, the more zombies there are and the harder it is to kill them. There are also things that pop up after killing zombies, like a bomb or nuke that destroys all of the zombies, insta-kill which kills zombies in one shot or stab, and max-ammo which is self-explanatory.

The online experience is just like Modern Warfare, which is different game modes like Team Deathmatch, Free-for-all, Search and Destroy, Headquarters, and Domination. Then there are also new modes like War and the return of Capture the Flag. There are also many new maps that are included with the game that have many different environments and is meant for different types of people (snipers, attack, defense). There are perks again, levels up to 65 this time, 10 prestiges again, all different guns based to the time period, kill streak perks are there again but with 7 kills dogs come and kill the other team. Long story short, the online experience is almost identical to Modern Warfare with a few extra things.

If you want to spend a little more money on this game, there is now downloadable content that Treyarch has made available. Currently, there are 3 new map packs available for $10 each and each of them include 3 new multiplayer maps and a new nazi zombies map. In my opinion, they are definitely worth the money especially if you like nazi zombies. The new nazi zombie maps include many new places with new features to each. They include even better ""futuristic"" guns, actual perks like juggernaut, slight of hand, quick revive, and double tap. You can even upgrade weapons to make them better and easier to kill enemies. Transporters and large maps are the new pieces of the new nazi zombies. They new maps for the most part are very open spaced and very interesting to play when you go online. I would definitely go for these maps if you want the continuous new experiences that World At War can give you. I believe that there is supposed to be one more map mack to be available later this year.

If you don't want to go back to World War II, this is very interesting and only the weapons would really give away the time period. If you don't want this game and you are reading this review, Modern Warfare 2 comes out in November and you should wait for this, but I would definitely pick this game up if you enjoy the Call of Duty series.",So much fun...you can keep playing!,1250467200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

While the gameplay is very enjoyable and each individual gameplay element is well implemented, it's the game's style (the art, the environments, the colors, the animations) that kept it all together and made it very unique.

That's why the game is a little hard to review for me, and it's weird to write a recommendation even! The problem is that describing the game makes it seem boring and uninventive. Almost all critics I've listened to describe this game as a Zelda-clone with hack & slash combat, and while that is an apt description, it fails to emphasize the fact that you won't feel like you are playing a Zelda-clone during the experience (at least, I haven't).

While the story isn't bad by any means, the game makes a point to not indulge in exposition... And that's GREAT! I wish more games would use their story only to give a simple context, rather than overemphasizing it and creating a split between gameplay and story. Cutscenes in this game are short and you will actually be playing the game for more than 95% of the time.

The gameplay consists of you visiting different areas, getting to a dungeon, getting through the dungeon, and fighting the boss at the end of that dungeon all while fighting enemies along the way. You'll be engaged in combat for a huge chunk of the game, and I am happy to say that the combat is interesting and challenging enough that it never becomes a chore. It's no Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden, but it's not a button masher by any means. You can go as deep into the combat system as you want, meaning you could potentially create long combostrings and feel like a badass, or you could just execute the same standard combo and wait until the enemy is dead. Combat upgrades are unlocked frequently and you are given the choice of choosing what you want to learn, meaning you will always have something new to try out during skirmishes.

Besides the combat, there is puzzle-solving, exploration and light plattforming. The latter works well as the controls are precise, and movement in general is a joy as you unlock new ways to traverse the environments. That also makes exploration a lot of fun since unlocking new abilities means reaching more places! Going back to collect all the Heart Stones, Rage Shards and Abyssal Armor Pieces is rewarding and, again, create a great feeling of constant progress. The puzzle-solving revolves around using your newly acquired items to solve very simple environmental puzzles. The 'puzzle-difficulty' (if you will) is comparable to any Zelda game, meaning that getting stuck is very uncommon, but it's still challenging enough to make it feel rewarding when you get through a dungeon.

DarkSiders is not flawless, however. My biggest complaint is the second third of the game (I would say between the 8th-12th hour mark) because it felt padded out. There is a section in the game, the Tower, that you are stuck in for quite some time! It's not a bad dungeon or anything - in fact the puzzles there were probably the most fun ones to solve -, but it came at a bad time. It's not that the whole game feels too long (I beat it in about 17 hours), but that particular section just lacked that feeling progress that I felt before because the setting stays the same. I am sure some would say the same about the next section of the game as well as it tasks you to backtrack, but that didn't bother me at all as it simply required teleporting to previous areas to solve a quick puzzle.

Besides that, it's hard for me to point out any more problems! Yes, I wish the combat was just a little deeper, but all in all DarkSiders turned out to be one of my favorite games to come out in the last generation of consoles. It feels fresh due to it's distinct style, and all of its parts come together very nicely to create an enjoyable experience. Absolutely recommend this game, and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. It's a memorable experience, and it'll definitely stick with me as I move on to other games.

Also, if you are worried about the rating, just a quick note: The violence is very cartoony, so I wouldn't say that the M-rating should scare parents away from purchasing the game for someone who is around the age of 14. There is lots of blood gushing out and War generally does 'cool stuff', but it all reminds me of the Hydra fight in the Disney movie Hercules in terms of violence... It's just cool, and the blood is just kind of there to emphasize how much War overkills enemies, basically. Check it out for yourself first, of course, but that's just my opinion.",Very Stylish Action-Adventure Game!,1430092800,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

The graphics were terrible, even for playstation, the difficulty was ridiculous and through the roof, your teammates were slow and stupid and the enemies all shot far more accurately then you could.

The difficulty was even backward, from everything I have read on the game- easy was hard and hard was easy. It was like the game wasn't even finished.

Now the game might not be that bad if it just let you relax and stealth through a mission. But, no, every map has an absurdly short timer, forcing you to run headlong from start to finish, shooting wildly at everything around you, trying to get to the end before your team gets slaughtered or the time runs out.

I only ever managed to beat the first mission once- and im pretty good at shooter games- but the second mission was only that much worse.

I have a rule, that I keep every game I own (rather then trading it in) forever and ever because you never know when one day you might want to go back and play it again. This is probably the only game I've ever owned that broke that rule. When I think of what the worst game I ever played was, this is usually what comes to mind.

The sound was terrible, the graphics were terrible, the controls were terrible, the difficulty was terrible, the TIMER was terrible, what little I seen of the AI was not impressive- teammates killing themselves like always- and even the lighting was terrible, forcing you to stare at this strange vista of green and black all the time.

You want a playstation one stealth shooter? Try Metal Gear Solid, or syphon filter, or anything. Anything at all.

So when I found out that there was a remake coming out I immediately went out and got a 3ds (NES edition, oh yeah) and bought the game. Omega Ruby is extremely fun and has aged a lot better than I thought it would. The game and story are the same as always but there are a few big changes that make this probably my favorite Pokemon to date. First off is having full 3D Pokemon, which is so good that I can never go back to 2D sprites. Then there's the DexNav, a device that identifies pokemon in the wild and, the more you use it, shows you their abilities and attacks (perfect for finding rarities like a Machop that knows Thunder Punch). Last of all is the trading system that is apparently ported over from X and Y, along with the really fun Wonder Trade, which lets you put in any Pokemon and get a random one from another trainer. Sometimes people on WT screw you over (players from Japan have been the worst in my experience, followed by Germany) but every now and them you will get something rare like a Ditto or useful like a Kadabra. People online have been making a big deal about only putting in good pokemon on WT, and I agree with them (I release any Zigzagoons or Wurmples that come my way). Overall Omega Ruby is a great game that I loved as a longtime fan of the series and can't wait to see what there is to find after beating the elite four.

The unit is designed very simply. You sit your 360 into this stand, and it cools the unit from below. You can put one game box to the right side, and your remote to the left. Really, that's not why you get the unit though :) It's all about the fan.

If you haven't been watching the news or hanging out with other gamers, the XBox 360 is VERY prone to crashing and completely melting down due to heat issues. Part of this might be that gamers lay their XBox 360s down on the ground - blocking all the vents so the system can't get normal air flow - or they jam their unit into a corner where the heat builds up. This system really needs to have ample air cooling around it and be in a vertical position. This stand helps to make sure you get that vertical position and that you have extra cooling. You REALLY want to keep the unit - like any computer or electronic device - away from lint, dust and other air-junk. Hopefully you are vacuuming frequently - and if you have a carpeted floor - have the unit on a piece of wood or something else to protect it.

By default the unit is USB powered so that you can plug it into the XBox 360 and then plug an USB item into the fan. However, it's sort of silly to make the XBox 360 work harder (and get hotter) to then power a fan to cool it down :) It's much better to plug the fan into the wall directly so that the XBox 360 gets as cool as possible while the fan draws its power from the wall. Most gamers have the necessary USB wall plug to handle this pretty easily - and if you don't, it's a cheap item to get.

The only real down side is that the fan has a manual on switch, but in the grand scheme of things, that's not a huge issue especially since you want it to turn on and off independently of the XBox 360. Also, I suppose you could complain about the fan's quiet noise, but since the XBox 360 is already a noisy machine, that's pretty much a wash.

It's been more than 5 years since the world was reintroduced to the Street Fighter franchise through the Street Fighter IV Series (SF4). With a new generation of consoles Street Fighter V (SFV) seeks to create an E-Sport experience why finally connecting the story line and fan bases of the different Street Fighter series. With SF4 being the current champ, SFV has a lot to live up to, and in some ways it does, while in others ways, some will say it suffers for being rushed out in order to make the Capcom Pro Tour and biggest Tournament in the world, EVO.

Gameplay 

The gameplay of SFV is a throwback of sorts. Gone are the one frame links, focus attacks and extended combos from SF4. Instead we have a game that feels slightly faster with attacks that feel more deliberate, there is more of a commitment as throwing out light punch in succession is not a powerful option like (SF4). The combos are shorter and the damage is higher so it feels a lot like Super Turbo (ST) mixed with just enough Street Fighter 3 Third Strike (SF3) creating something that feels good at all times. There is no longer an Ultra system like SF4 so players are no longer rewarded for losing. The closest thing to a comeback mechanic is the fact that you can no longer die from chip out on regular attacks. So if you have no life but the character is still fighting, you cant lose on a blocked attack unless it is a Critical Art. SFV also brings back the stun meter and fan favorite feature from SF3. Its very helpful to new players and experience player alike to always have understanding of where your character is in terms of danger.

The newest gameplay feature in SFV is the V-Trigger/V-Skill system. This helps to differentiate SFVs already diverse cast even more by giving them individualized special abilities to take advantage of during the match. Ryus V-Skill allows him to Parry like in SF3 while, his V-Trigger makes his Hadouken Denjin mode causing more stun. Nashs V-Skill allows him to absorb projectiles and his V-Trigger has him teleporting around to get out of danger or extend combos. This system makes even characters that are similar like Ryu/Ken feel even more different and helps to individualize playstyles since overall SFV does have fewer options compared to past games. The characters only have one Critical Art which is the SFV version of the Ultra form SF4 or Supers from SF3, and of course the game has few characters overall.

SFV has 16 different characters, ranging from the standards like Ryu and Chun Li, the return of Alpha standouts like Karin and R. Mika, and four brand new characters. The roster may sound limited and feel unappealing considering there is a chance your favorite from a past game didn't make it in. But definitely give it a chance, all the characters feel different and viable and you might be surprised at what characters you gravitate to.

Story 

With SF4 Capcom walked all over any type of canon and continuity that they had between previous games. With SFV Capcom attempts to repair that, the problem is the main story isn't available and won't be available until June. So what we have in its place isn't even an Arcade mode. For some reason Capcom removed that and instead we have individual character prologue stories. The Prologue stories sound good on paper, as they are designed to set up the story and connections the characters have before the cinematic story is released and connects all the games up to SF3 in the timeline. The problem is the prologue stories for each fighter are 3 or 4 one round fights. Before the start and end we are greeted with static low quality comic book style artwork with voices speaking over them. It feels like a big downgrade from SF4 which features anime intros and endings. The style of the story is similar to MK in away as in that game you will fight with one character for only 3 or 4 matches before changing character or chapter. SFV would probably get less flack for the layout of the prologue stories if they had been more connected to each other and played in one session.

Graphics/Sound 

SFV is a good looking game, it is bright and colorful, with exaggerated character design that makes them look more cartoony similar to SF4. There is some clipping and some people have experienced issues with scan lines and screen tearing, but these cases seem to be few and far between.

The Sound design is better than past games. Also the English voiceovers are actually good and much better than SF4. You still have access to Japanese voices if you prefer and the music is fits the game very well. The remixes of classic themes really at to the old yet new feel of the game has going for it.

Play Time/Replayability 

In a lot of ways SFV is a barebones fighting game. The current story mode is extremely lacking, they removed arcade mode, and the only other single player mode is survival. Survival allows you to fight 10,30,50, or 100 fights. This mode is the only way to unlock character colors.

Trials, Arcade, Story, and other modes are supposed to be coming as free downloads in early March, but these items should have been available day one.

The online play works very well as most of the issues from the launch were fixed within a day or two. I've had over 200 matches and only experienced lag in about 15 of them. But again much like in 2009 with SF4, what is wrong with the online play is that there is no penalty for disconnecting. Capcom says they are working on a solution but this is not acceptable, in too many ways this game takes steps backs in terms of features. The current lobby system is limited in player count, there is no spectator mode, and no additional mode options like Team Battle or Tournament, etc Once again Capcom is supposed to be patching them in, but these should have been here day one.
What Capcom does do with the online is the Capcom Fighters Network (CFN). With CFN you can easily see all your stats and matches in one place. You can also view leaderboards, view and follow top players, and watch all their recorded matches.

Taking a moment to talk about DLC and feature disc. Capcom has made it a point to talk about how SFV will offer a service type experience. During the last generation with SF4 when the Super version came out, your vanilla SF4 disc was more or less useless as you could not get the new characters or modes without buying Super. Capcom fixed this issue with later upgrade releases being compatible with Super but you still had to pay for them.

This time around Capcom is offering players the option of buying all the DLC with Fight Money (FM). Fight Money is earned as you play SFV; you get it for wins in ranked online play, and for completing the story and survival modes. When the Story launches (again in March) you will be able to unlock additional characters and costumes with your FM. The problem with this system is that FM can only be earned when you are connected online. So lets say you are working through Hell mode in survival, If you lose connection then you lose all the FM you would have earned. Or if you have Fight Request on, and anything happens to your connection during that online match, you will be kicked back to the menu instead of your position in the single player mode losing FM again. Also lets not pretend Capcom is going to make this easy. They want you to spend money, so while right now the FM rewards are good and most of us already have enough to unlock the first DLC character Alex (From SF3), it is not going to be this easy going forward.

Final Recommendation 

Based just on the feeling you get when fighting Street Fighter V is an amazing game. The problem is the game was obviously rushed out to be EVO eligible for 2016 and it suffers because of it. The game is lacking features that cater to the casual market, as well as features that have become standard for the competitive market. So what should have been an amazing package feels lacking. Down the road when all the features that should have been day one are released SFV would probably be a 9 or 10 package, but based on what we have now, the game is merely very good.",Coulda been a contender for all.

I have 04 and I played it to death, so I was ready for a change, not just roster updates, but a change in the game to make it fresh and appealing. Yes, as you read above, the new Owner Mode will keep you playing until you're in a nursing home, but the the big addition this year of course is the ability to take your skills on XBOX Live which is a big plus compared to 04 and if you have XBOX Live, this certainly gives it more replay value by allowing you to play with anyone anytime.

 Putting it to the test, I looked for some other changes in the game. E.A. added the ""batters or hitters"" eye feature. It gives you a quick glimpse with a flash of light right when the ball leaves the pitchers hand. The ball changes colors as it's thrown to show you what type of pitch is being launched.  The ball leaves a contrail, a lot like a comet that helps players to tell the the speed and trajectory of the pitch. The better a player's batting attributes, the longer a pitch will retain its color and contrail as it comes down the shoot. It gives you a split second to determine where the ball will probably end up giving you the chance to swing accordingly. It's definitely in favor of the batter and can be turned on or off in the options screen. For me,  its just for a little glitz and something new, but I don't feel it's a neat or cool addition to the game. I also don't seem to hit better with or without it, I suppose in the end, it's up to you.

The graphics are better than last year, this time supporting 780HD TV's and people with wide screen will be in love. The graphics overall have also been heaved up the mark. The players faces looked quite bad last year, flat faces, with no character.  E.A. listened, the players faces look more lifelike and show more emotion than ever and you can recognize the big name boys at first glance. Signature batting stances are also more pronounced this year and each year I see them getting closer to the real guys signature moves and stance. I'd like to see a little spitting and player mannerisms before they go to bat, but the stances will have to do. Crotch grabbing also is not one of E.A.'s focuses this year either, thank goodness. I noticed a few more diving catches and some fantastic motion captured throws and dives than '04. I really couldn't notice them at first glance, but the more you play, the more you appreciate the time spent in the varied and countless motion captured moves througout the game. The most important part of any baseball game is fluid gameplay and MVP baseball plays as smooth as you could want especially when you field, it just seems so natural.

The sound is right on the mark, teriffic sound effects, sounds of the bat smaking the ball, trash talking in the stands, screaming fans, good announcing and great Digital Music, they got that right. The owner mode is right on mark too and is the dynasty mode for baseball. It's a bit different than other E.A games though, it's more or less about pricing tickets for your stadium, concessions, and  trying to get fans to the games that don't bring in revenues usually. Owner mode is about making money and keeping your players happy. If you got the time, and shame on you if you do, the game allows you 30 years to make your organization successful. 30 years of gaming, hmmm, how do people find time to do this??

But don't cry, sports games is about multiplayer action anyway, and with the ability to go at it online and play with a friend on your couch, that is how the game should be played anyway.

Anyhoo, as many people know, this could be the last MVP baseball, at least for some years anyway due to the licensing issues with other companies, but since E.A. stole the NFL license in return, I'm happy to see someone else do it to them. I find it appauling the world allows rich game companies to buy out licenses to keep other game companies from competing. E.A. may say otherwise, but that is basically what they are doing. Mind you, I love E.A. but with less competition for the future, does this mean less quality for their games? Let's pray and hope not.

Back to the game, this game is very fun. The graphics are a lot better than 04 and I was happy to see it on XBOX Live too. I have to say it plays great so far, and I have not seen any XBOX Lag issues for it yet. I just hope more people join the bandwagon, (I think everyone is playing NBA Street)  If you don't have XBOX Live, the Owner mode will keep you happy for 30 years though, so don't think this game doesn't have any replay value.

I think Indiana Jones is the best of all of them, and I like the Lego games a lot because of their user-friendliness, and ability to go back and redo levels as your favorite character. But Ice Age is in a close second. Now for the review: If you want a game that is easy to play for all ages and superbly fun, pick this up. You won't regret it. Also, I haven't played this game extensively yet, considering that I only got it yesterday.

Levels: so far I have encountered levels in caves, out in the wide open, and in the thick of a jungle. There are ""Ice-Agey"" snow levels briefly at the beginning, but you move to the jungle parts quickly. Scrat's levels are two-dimensional, and simpler than the rest.

Characters: So far I have used Sid, Manny, Scrat, and a new character, Buck.

Sid: Kind of an all-around guy with simple skills such as attacks and slams.

Manny: only used for certain types of levels where you need to move heavy objects.

Scrat: Like in the movies, Scrat is a crazy idiot who's constantly chasing his beloved acorn. His attack moves remind me of a kung-fu fighter on a sugar rush.

Scratte: A girl version of Scrat. She fights with her tail and is a little less hyper with her movements.

Buck: My absolute favorite! He is awesome! The moment you see him in a cut scene, you think Indiana Jones/Zorro. He's got this neat little eye patch, made out of a leaf. But the best part comes when you use him in a level. He's got this AWESOME whip, which is his means of attack, and swinging across big gaps. He also has this gun thing that shoots fire or something, one that shoots honey or water (whichever you fill it with), and some type of grenade. He can also slide on vines and on the backs of large dinosaurs. He is indeed an awesome character. I love him!!!!

The bad parts of this game are quite small: The multiplayer mode is pretty pathetic compared to the singleplayer story mode. It's basically a lot of minigames. I think they could have done an alternate story for two players. That would make this game considerably better. The minigames themselves are eerily similar to the fantastic ones in Crash Bash. But if you want to burn some time with your friends, it's okay.

Nothing else to say as yet, but I will definitely have some regular updates.

--Update--

As of this update, I have used one new character, Scratte (see above) and also done two levels where you use Buck flying a pterodactyl, with Crash and Eddie as passengers. The first flying level is two-dimensional, the second is 3D and a bit easier. So far, you use Buck in four levels, not counting the pterodactyl ones.",Great Game!!,1262995200,4,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

5.0,True,"11 6, 2009",AVX1L42T98R8P,B000XJNTPG,Benjamin S. Sprague,"Brutal Legend is a great game. So great in fact it's only down fall is it concludes very fast. The saying goes ""Time flies when you're having fun"" and no quote could be more genuine when summing up Brutal Legend.

To be honest I was excited about this game until I found out that in addition to the action oriented hack n slash game play it was also a real time strategy game. RTS has never been a genre that appealed to me. I'm more about being a loner or in a small group as opposed to dictating the actions of up to 50 or so troops  with different strengths and weaknesses. Yet somehow Double Fine had me addicted to the RTS ""battle of the bands"" set up as well as the driving escort missions, gunning death rack tower segments, and even helping my head banger bros score beer and babes. Getting a gamer to be captivated by genres he normally dislikes is no easy feat. As a matter fact to date I'd say Brutal legend is the only title that had me enjoy types of game play I'd normally be insanely frustrated by.

While Brutal Legend is influenced by Heavy Metal I don't necessarily think you have to love that genre of music to be enthralled by what is offered. It tells a decent fantasy tale with its' own unique mythology.  Despite the fact Brutal Legend throws Grand theft auto, God of war,  Zelda Ocarina of time, and Over lord into a blender it retains being original and non confusing.

Starting off Eddie Riggs is a likable hero. When I saw the first Brutal Legend trailer I thought maybe Eddie would end up being like Kratos aka a dumb enraged testosterone jock covered in leather and spikes. Instead Eddie cares about others, refuses to be a glory hog, and is more akin to that lovable best friend you knew in high school whom despite looking ""scary"" was very charismatic, generous, and optimistic.

However Eddie does not start out our tale as a happy camper. Pretty much the game drops us into a scene where Eddie's talents as a roadie are being exploited by a tween pop band trying to pass themselves off as the new equivalent of heavy metal.  Eddie's awesome stage is referred to as ""ironic in a retro sort of way"" and one of the rockers gleefully enjoys breaking  guitars just so Eddie has to fix them. In a humorous kind of way the scene reminded me of Cinderella only Eddie is a guy and instead of having 3 wicked step sisters he has to contend with three jerk wad step brothers. Most of us would understand if Eddie cussed out the manager and quit on the spot but instead he selflessly saves one of the band members from plummeting to his death. Eddie's heroism is ironically rewarded by having a stage prop fall atop his burly frame. Riggs' martyred blood mingles with his magic belt buckle summoning an angry yet noble monster of yore. With a mighty roar Omigodan the fire beast slays the blasphemers stopping their terrible music than it whisks Eddie away to an enchanted dark fantasy world influenced by the awesomeness that is ""True Metal"".

Yes, I realize this sounds cheesy. We can draw parallels to it being similar to Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonder Land. However the rock n roll death metal studded presentation of the tired ""Stranger in a strange land"" plot device works perfectly.

Upon arriving in an alternative lifestyles version Never Ever Land Eddie slays a bunch of blood thirsty occultists with an axe he finds then meets a sweet yet fierce young woman named Ophelia. She tells Eddie the robed weirdos he decapitated are the servants of the demon emperor Deviculous and that there is a human resistance trying to over throw their evil master. Equipped with his battle axe and electric guitar that can raise relics of ancient power or melt faces Eddie constructs a hot-rod on the spot, riding off into the sun set with the mysterious yet hot Goth girl to save mankind.

You will proceed to interact with the lovable yet eccentric guardian of Metal Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy the hellacious biker healer, Lita the spirited Amazon, and Lars the golden haired hero who fast becomes your new best friend.  If these famous real life cameos were just thrown in to sell a bad product I would have felt cheated. As it stands they are woven in seamlessly with the world they are apart of. Every person in the game has good motivations for being the way they are and they seem more concerned with contributing to a good yarn than with out-staging each other.

Brutal Legend has a sand box world. In truth you can blow through the story line as fast as a guitarist riding the lightning but if you go that route you are going to miss out on a lot of land marks, extra missions, hidden music tracks to play while driving around in your Druid Plow, world folklore, and secret guitar riffs which grant Eddie arcane war-spell techniques whilst battling making victories come much easier. Unearthing these mementos of the forgotten age likewise increases ""fire tributes"" which you use to upgrade your hot rod and fighting combos within Ozzy's motor lodges.

The thing I really hope developers learn from Brutal Legend is its' perfect balance of campy humor and emotionally driven sincerity. While it can be stated Tim Schaefer's newest offering doesn't take itself too seriously it also doesn't undermine itself with an over abundance of bad ham and moldy cheese. Jack Black whom voiced Eddie walks the delicate line between satire and tragedy with perfect harmony. I honestly  have more respect for him now. I'm hoping future movie producers see Jack's true potential and stop giving him roles that undermine his hidden talent.

By this point I've explained enough. I cannot say anymore without edging dangerously close to spoiler territory. This game is one that has to be experienced instead of merely read about. Words alone fail to express the creativity, awe, and mirth packed into this sour yet sweet nostalgic road trip through Heavy Metal heaven!

Pros

+Breath taking twisted yet beautiful world to traverse.

+ Good blend of RTS, driving, exploration, fun mini games, and visceral combat.

+ Acting and sound track are the best in the business.

+ A tale that is not too grim yet not ridiculously silly either.

+ Fun multi-player RTS battles over Xbox live

+ The enemy types are scary yet outrageously hilarious at the same time. Every creature encountered is some sort of parody or tribute to the various kinds of heavy metal music.

Cons

-Game is a bit short but to its' credit the ending brought a smile to my face. (Unlike Fable 2. Cough.)

-The upcoming down-loadable content is ""meh"" if you are more intrigued by the single player story line than you are the RTS aspects.

  -Tim Schafer is not renowned for making sequels. For those like myself who want a sequel we may have to bite off  a bit of bad tasting disappointment.

-Side missions get repetitive and there are only around 4 types of them. For what its' worth these mini quests extend the game and they're fun for what they are.

-Though I took to the mish mash of game styles some may be more puzzled than pleasantly surprised by BL's patchwork Frankenstein of genres.",Perfect for me but on the short side all the same,1257465600,6,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},
4.0,False,"11 9, 2013",A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B00BU3WVM6,AUTISTIC WEREWOLF,"I liked the game actually.  The game is trying to be sort of a poor man's Bioshock.  The METRO LAST LIGHT graphics aren't all that great certainly no where near Bioshock graphics quality.  METRO LAST LIGHT graphics has that unfinished line drawing quality that is its ""style"" not owing to a lack of quality per-se.  Its just the comic book drawing style loses it punch over time.  The look and feel of the graphics is not lush, detailed and realistic.  The graphics do excel at playing with light and darkness on a level few other video games equal.  The story while good is nothing to write home about.  The games idea of difficulty is pretty much give you inferior weapons and throw wave after wave of bad guys against you which starts off fun but gets real old, really quick.

The METRO LAST LIGHT story line has some bright spots but they are not developed to their full potential.  I did not pay full price for this game so I don't exactly feel ill used in its purchase.  METRO LAST LIGHT  is easy enough to play provided you don't mind the rather predictable strictly linear fashion of gameplay. METRO LAST LIGHT game play is a throwback to times when there was no such thing as a sandbox game.  The gamer has almost no input on how the story develops.  METRO LAST LIGHT is a totally scripted game that has only one action track which is what makes the game boring. when compared to games open environment games like Bioshock.  Don't get me wrong  METRO LAST LIGHT is not a bad game but it is not worth paying full price for.

Pay twenty dollars for this game and you won't be disappointed, Pay more than twenty dollars for METRO LAST LIGHT and you might not be a happy camper. What takes a star off for me is that METRO LAST LIGHT is just a alien\enemy wave generator which is the cheapest game developers ploy. Games that have little substance to offer substitute wave after wave of monster hoping this will destract the gamer from the absence of real immersive plot and character development.  A sophisticated gamer soon see's the ineffective\barely effective weapons you use while pitted against waves of enemies with vastly superior weapons to be the cheap ploy it obviously is.

METRO LAST LIGHT falls victim to its developers lack of vision proved by so many places where the game just throws enemies at you scant reason that does not move the story forward in compelling ways.  I liked  METRO LAST LIGHT  because; it took my mind, heart and gaming experience to a new fictional place the post apocalyptic Moscow Underground but make no mistake on the METRO LAST LIGHT journey you are flying coach in the gaming.  METRO LAST LIGHT is not the first class gaming experience Bioshock or Dead Space delivers.

He does a good job of explaining how to do it.

Here it is in a nutshell:

install the game
find, download, and install SystemShock2_patch.exe
in the installation folder, rename sshock2.exe to sshock2.old
find and download SystemShock2_xp_2000_fix.zip
copy the exe from the above zip file to the installation folder

in the installation folder
open shock.cfg with notepad
at the end of that file, on a separate line, add this: safe_texture_manager
save and exit the file

Windows XP boot.ini changes (BE CAREFUL!)
go to control panel, system, advanced, startup and recovery, settings
click edit
add the following line under the [operating system] section:
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS=""Microsoft Windows XP - System Shock 2 Game"" /noexecute=optin /fastdetect /numproc=1

save the boot.ini file
reboot
when prompted, select the ""Microsoft Windows XP - System Shock 2 Game"" option

Windows boots like usual
play the game

After you play the game through to its ending, be sure to remove the ""numproc=1"" line that you added to boot.ini.

4.0,False,"10 30, 2006",AJDTDS2IJ4L2G,B000CBZPDO,He who has no name,"Before I start, I'd like to first say that this is an actual review of the game by someone who owns and plays the game, not like the above 'review' of someone copying out of the Chaos Theory instruction manual, and saying how good Double Agent WILL be.

This game has three major parts to it- Solo, Coop, and Versus, just like Chaos Theory. I won't really be talking much about the Co-op, as it is basically just a continutation of the Chaos Theory coop. However, this time, it feels like there are actually enough missions. There are some new moves, but basically, it feels the same as the CT Coop. So, now, onto single player,

Single Player-

I haven't quite beaten the game yet, so I can't really comment on the heavily hyped multiple endings gameplay (Check back in a week or two for details on the endings). So, to start off, you are in iceland with a dumbass computer partner. You do a bit of preliminary activities with him, then are boosted into a secret underground base. I personally despise this level, as it is repetitive, not very graphically suprising with its settings (with the exception of the ice caves at the very beginning), and you are not faced with any hard choices, or special challenges. I begrudginly finished the level, crossing my fingers that the game would improve.

My wish was granted. As soon as I hit the jail level, the game took a suprising turn for the better. There was a trust meter, and although at times it didn't make sense (the JBA wouldn't nessicarily trust you less for something they didn't know about), it added another level to the game. In one sequence (""Scripted Moments""), I was confronted with the choice to kill a jailyard bully, or to merely knock him out. I chose to kill him to please my new freind, and the consequences were with me almost three levels later (I'll explain this below). For one, I was given a higher amount of JBA trust, and thus, a lower level of NSA trust. I was given a gun to fight with in the jail level, but in the level after it, my boss's boss cut me off from some equipment, making that level harder to complete. Getting back to the jail level, the lighting was beautifully designed, and what happened was plausible (there was a riot, creating a diversion, etc). There were many ways of going about things, making that level seem more open ended than most Chaos Theory levels. Also, the optional objectives now have meaning. In Chaos Theory it was the percent completed of the level (your score) that you got at the end, but in Double Agent, your mission ends if a trust level goes too low on either end- so you need to carefully weigh out your optional objectives, and usually complete all of them. Some of the levels you will undoubtably tip your trust level to one side, which angered me a bit, considering  you don't have a choice about your primary objectives. There is an odd ""HQ"" mission where you are not allowed to kill anyone, and are pretending to be someone else, so the JBA doesn't suspect you are a double agent. I liked it when a guard would yell at you to surrender, then come to arrest you, and you would rip the gun out of his hand, and preform a pretty cool knockout move on him. Mostly  the equipment is the same as CT, with a few added things, like the C-13 somthing launcher (in the HQ missions), and the EMP grenade rounds that disable electronic devices permanatly, but mainly, your kit is the same as in CT. And that is the biggest flaw of this game, and the reason I gave it a 4 out of five stars- there isn't enough new about this game. There was the first splinter cell, which had amazing graphics, a pretty new idea, and was amazingly executed- then there was chaos theory, which had ridicuosly good graphics, better than any other Xbox game I've seen, as well as an added touch of realism that perfected the package, in addition to the amazingly beautiful lighting, and original settings. Unfortunatly, this game wasn't a leap forward- it was just a few steps. The graphics are very similar to Chaos Theory, with precious few changes, and the other game elements react in very similar ways to before. However, the trust meter system, the amazingly well done Oshtosk level, and the amount of plot (it actually matters, unlike previous splinter cell games) make for a gigantic amount of replay value, and overall, an enjoyable single player experience.

Versus Mode-

Now this is where Double Agent really makes a breakthrough. I think they sensed at the right time that the old Spy V Merc gameplay was getting a little old, and spiced it up with this new, action packed game. You can play the Multiplayer in many differnt ways, unlike before. The basic game is Spy v. Spy- two teams, or many individuals- all armed with a reasonably powerful sub-machine gun, and amazing physical abilities are pitted against each other. The gun has a small ammo capacity, and slow firing speed, but it gets the job done at shortish ranges. This game is way more fast paced, and the characters are much more agile than before. There are also a ton of lethal close combat moves, which are very fun. For example, you run up to an enemy, you both grab each others throats, then whoever wins a really short minigame first, gets the kill. This ranges from kicking the opponent in the face, to elbowing him in the neck, to snapping his neck. Then, there's my favorite, if someone comes up and grabs you from behind, if you're fast enough, you toss them over your shoulders, their head hitting the ground hard, killing them. It definintly makes for a more fast paced, and less stealy game, with the usage of weapons, and the lethal close combat moves. It is definintly fun, and the sheer number of maps and game possibilities, makes it fun to play over and over again.

So, all in all, despite the lack of a huge amount of new substance, single player and multiplayer together make for a great gaming package, definintly worth the $40 if  you are a fan of the Splinter Cell series, and want to see where it is heading.

This is a role playing game with every aspect under control. You don't just run in a mad ax-flailing rush as quickly as you can move your controller. Instead, each character can only move X blocks a turn. This gives you plenty of time to explore the room, evaluate your options, determine exactly who should move where to get the best results.

The graphics are rather impressive for a game of this style. You get the torches in the corners, the campfires, the chests and various types of monsters. However, the game goes a bit overboard in this area. They are going for a dark, gloomy look. The result is that you literally can't see what is going on on the screen. I would get alerts that I was being attacked - and I would see something swinging - but I would have no idea where they were, what they were or how I was arranged around them. I would try to navigate for a better view and be unsuccessful. Some times I literally had to move my characters to a clearer area of a room just to be able to see what was going on.

The menu system is a bit overwhelming. They try to stuff a lot of information into the game and it ends up being a pain to wade through. What's ironic is that D&D fans are going to find plenty of important things that were left out. They definitely could have done another month or two of tuning on this to make the game more intuitive to play as well as including a few more aspects that D&Ders have come to expect.

There's also a problem with how tasks are laid out. If you happen to kill Monster X, suddenly you can't go loot the rest of the dungeon. You have to be very careful to do things in order.

Still, for real D&D fans this is about as close as you can get for a D&D experience on a PSP. Well recommended as a fun game to get your D&D fix, as long as you can be patient and tolerate some of its issues.",Great Detail - Some Issues in Implementation,1247443200,,,

Rather than introducing a lot of new features, Civilization IV tends to stick with the tried-and-true aspects of the series.

Those familiar with the series will recognize the gameplay. The player takes the role of a civilization - one of many real-world empires, such as the English, the Greeks, or the Japanese.  The game is turn-based, with each unit moving a certain distance - and getting a certain amount done - each day. The focus is on infrastructure as much as warfare, with most of the units having to do with building cities or maintaining the land around them. Settlers build cities, which serve as a hub for a local network of farms, villages, and mines. Cities can build specific structures or units, and each has its own happiness meters to take care of.

Outside of cities, the major area is research - various technologies (with descriptions narrated by Leonard Nimoy) in fields like architecture, agriculture, literature, and religion that boost your civilization's power. Of course, if you can't resort to peaceful measures with the other civilizations, there is always war, conducted in a fairly simple tactical manner (mostly just consisting of unit strength and any bonuses).

New to Civ IV is the expansion of governments. There are now several key parts to the government of your civilization - the leadership, the distribution of labor, the enforcement of religion, and so on. Religion, also, is new to the game. Different religions have different effects on your empire. Furthermore, there can be a difference between what your ""state"" religion is and what individual cities' religions are. Generally, you have better relations with people of the same religion, so you should try to use missionaries to expand your chosen religion. Another new feature is the concept of ""Great People"" - individuals who are summoned by researching certain advances in the fine arts or whatever field they may specialize in. These people can give several sorts of one-time bonuses and are fairly rare, so their usage is very important.

The graphics are decent, but kind of minimal in usage. There aren't a lot of visual indicators, so really it's just more like a board game with little pieces. It serves mostly a utilitarian purpose, just to show where stuff is and not really have any sort of epic scale or embellishment. One part that is pretty neat is the option to zoom out and see the entire map as a globe, dotted by the various cities and empires. But, other than that, there's not much to the graphics. The music is nice, with different songs for each leader and each civilization. Music increases as you are over empires depending on their point in the timeline - a medieval civilization has the proper music, for example. This is a nice ambient touch and the music is well-executed in general.

As a whole, this game is more of the same. For some people, that's a good thing, but I personally felt like there wasn't enough depth in the game as a whole. It concentrated too much on the entirety of history and lost the enjoyment of being in certain periods. It is a good game, yes, but it just didn't really feel as deep as it could or should have.

So I jumped on it when I later found out it had been released, and got a good deal on the collector's edition.

As the title says, I really wanted to like this game. I'm a fan of the Resident Evil & Silent Hill series, as well as other titles on the genre spectrum like Siren and Fatal Frame. Add to that the location setting of Tibetan mountains and Far East mythology, and it sounded like an awesome entry into my library. Alas, I was to be disappointed.

Some people have stated the game was slow, but I agree with others that say that for survival horror, it's pretty standard, so I didn't have a problem with that. I was even enjoying the story and main character, for as far as I got. What killed my enjoyment was the controls and laggy response in the combat system. Encounters with one or two monsters was manageable, but the controls were clunky enough that more enemies than that made it extremely difficult to keep going and eventually I got frustrated and stopped playing it.

The game mechanic of 'slashing' the enemies with the Wii-mote was intriguing, but the way the programmers implemented it, was far too twitchy to keep the game fun. I would vastly have preferred something like the glyph system in Castlevania: Dawn Of Sorrow. For those not familiar with it, different monsters were defeated by a particular glyph you drew with your stylus. Something like that would have been fairly easy with a Wii-mote. Instead the game had trouble registering basic movements with it, probably due to poor programming.

It really was a shame, because I was looking forward to this game. Perhaps some day I'll go back and try again, but I have a lot of other things to play first so it doesn't look very likely. I'm sure plenty of 'hard core' gamers out there will think I'm just a wuss with poor skills, but I literally own about 800 games across a dozen consoles and the PC. I'm not a top-tier 'twitch' gamer, but I think my skills are pretty good most of the time.

Well I was initially a little disappointed and felt that they released the game too early but once I got to tweaking the camera, cinema playback and controller options it solved or eased alot of the problems I was encountering.

I'll keep this short by giveing the good points and bad.
Bad points first. There are frame rate issues if you have the auto cinema feature turned on they can get really bad when a lot of people are on the screen attacking you at one time. If you turn it off you probably won't see a problem with frame rates again.
Second problem is the camera, this can be a problem but you can manually adjust or speed up the auto adjust rate in the options menu and this helps a lot.
Graphically speaking it's a little inconsistent. The particle effects are great but at the same time some of the backgrounds are pretty bland. It's kind of a mixed bag but due to some of the things they've done regarding retaining chopped body parts long after you've left a room in the game it takes a toll on memory usage and thus taxes the 360 quite a bit. Add that to the size of the environments, the number of characters on screen at once and this game pushes the 360 pretty hard.
The other problem though not really a problem, but more of an annoyance is that the enemies are a little on the cheap side this time so you are forced to be a little more creative.

Now for the good:
Believe it or not they have actually improved the gameplay. You start off now with a long list of moves as opposed to hardly any in the original. Countering has been refinded so that you can properly time it. Weapons are now very varied and don't overlap in terms of usage. Enemy AI is incredible you can actually notice the enemies adjusting to your attack patterns. Granted this makes things more difficult but ultimately more satisfying when you win. The level design has gotten rid of a lot of the platforming and focuses much more on the fighting aspect of the game. Secondary weapons are chargable and are actually useful, can anyone actually admit that they used the bow much in the first one?

The story is actually a little more coherent now and makes a bit of sense, though not much. Last but not least It's a great game but a new Missions mode and a little more refinement of the default settings would have made this a classic.",Not a classic but still great,1212710400,18,,

In detail:  I've been a Mario Kart fan since the first version on the SNES. I can't count hour many hours I've dropped into this series over the years, but there's no game franchise I love more than the Mario Kart universe. This version of Mario Kart is almost perfect, and the few small flaws don't take away from it enough to give it a bad rating in my book.

What I love:

They've brought 16 classic tracks back, with a bit of updating that feels natural for the Wii. The new bikes and karts all seem to blend in to these older tracks like they were always meant to be there, and I loved playing with them.  The 16 new tracks are great and several of them are downright fantastic.  The bikes and karts can do stunts now, and while I've disliked some of the gimmicks they've introduced in the past (Double Dash driving for example)...the stunts actually add fun to this game.

The online mode is wonderful. Although it's difficult to find your friends at first, once you've swapped 12 digit PIN numbers and waited the required period of time for Nintendo to verify that you actually want to play together, you'll be good to go.  The Mario Kart channel is packed in with this game, and it's a must if you like stats.  The channel records your records, allows you to race your friend's ghosts...and the ghosts of the best racers in the world. I've had great fun just jumping into a race with 11 strangers and trying to win gold coins.  The coins you win (or lose) in each race are added to your total overall racer score, which everyone sees when you enter a race.  This essentially helps you figure out who the vets and who the new folks are....and new folks are awarded HUGE bonuses if they beat someone with a higher racer score.  Nice touch!

What I didn't love:

Battle Mode.  They've completely ruined what I loved about the old battle modes by turning it into a team-based game. Gone are the days when you and 3 friends could challenge each other to a free-for-all balloon popping match, now you must team up with a partner (sometimes a computer controlled teammate) and try for the highest score.  If you're playing with odd numbers of friends, this is just the worst.

The Wheel.  It was fun for 5 minutes, but after trying all the other controller options, I rate it dead last for accuracy.  If it wasn't free with the game...I'd highly recommend buying a version without it.  The only good thing I can say about it that it's great for new players.  Two friends who had never played Mario Kart were able to jump right in on the wheel and get going.  Veterans will be more comfortable with the classic controller, their Gamecube controller, or even the Nunchuck/Wiimote combo (my current favorite).

Overall..this is the best version since the N64.  It's everything the DS version was, on a big screen with fantastic online play and no snaking.  If you own a Wii, you must buy it.",Mario Kart is a must have for the Wii,1210204800,,,

It's inexpensive enough that there aren't any of the bells-and-whistles, like macros, which tend to break compatibility.

The buttons, d-pad, etc, are all basically in the top 75% of the ones I have used, and work well for FPS games, puzzle games, emulators.  Basically, when you need a gamepad for your PC and don't want to futz with settings and updates and bluetooth syncing, pick up one of these and plug it in.

5.0,True,"11 8, 2015",A3G973ZIQTRGJX,B001E27DLM,Jeffrey C Matthews,"Chrono Trigger is a true classic that is regarded by many as one of the best RPGs of all time. It is my personal favorite, and I still consider it to be the greatest RPG ever made. It is the RPG by which all other RPGs should be judged by, in terms of gameplay, story, sound, and overall quality.

[If you do not want to read through the ENTIRE review, you can read the last paragraph where i briefly summarize some of the higher merits of the game]

[You may skip this first paragraph if you want to get to the review proper]

The Premise of the story and plot is centered around the concept of time. It is the year 1000 A.D. You play the role of Chrono, a spiky-haired teen who lives with his mom and cat in the kingdom of Guardia. At Guardia's Millennial Fair, he meets Marle, the king's tomboyish daughter. Together, they go to see Crono's friend Lucca's new invention, which is a transportation device that will beam someone from one pod to the other. Marle offers to try it out, but the mysterious pendant she wears reacts to the machine's energy, and she is pulled through a portal opened up by the pendant. Crono goes through the portal to try to bring her back, and ends up 400 years in the past! Thus begins a long journey to stabilize the time stream and put the universe back in its working order before the day of the apocalypse.

 If that does not sound interesting to you already then rpgs just may not be your cup of tea. This is merely just the prologue of the story. The main party of characters will grow as you travel across many time periods, and even alternate time lines in an attempt to save the future from the past. The plot becomes very rich and deep, which makes it very easy to get into and create a truly immense world for the gamer to delve in to.

The gameplay in Chrono Trigger is some of the best in any RPG. Ever. Being an RPG, it has the same basic formula of other games in the genre during the SNES era. There are two parties, and you take turns attacking each other. Thats pretty much where the similarities end. Like some other RPGs, the battles are not random. Instead, you see the enemies on your screen before battle, and you can avoid them if you please (Grandia, Secret of Mana, and others use similar systems). When you begin a battle in Chrono Trigger, the first thing you will notice is that the parties aren't lined up in straight lines across the field like in so many other RPGs. During the fight, your characters will move all around the field, which makes for a more realistic experience and even adds to the strategy. The next thing you will notice is the bar below each of your characters names. This is what is referred to as an ACT bar. When a characters ACT bar is fully filled, they can perform an action. In Chrono Trigger, the three actions are Attack, Tech, and Item. Choosing attack will have your character unleash a standard attack on an enemy of your choice. Item will have them use an item. Now that the obvious is out of the way, lets move our focus to the Tech option, and the real innovation of Chrono Trigger. This is one feature that really sets this game apart from anything else out there. The Tech option opens a list of special attacks (all character specific) that can be used by your character. You can wait until your other characters have filled their ACT bars and unleash a bigger Tech attack. Combinations of different characters have different Tech attacks, and each attack has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, Crono and Frog can perform the X Slash attack together after they have both learned certain Techs, while Marle and Crono can perform Aura Whirl together. As each character learns new Techs and the game progresses, new Dual Techs and even Triple Techs will be added to the list. This adds a lot of strategy to the game and makes the battles very intense. Although the amount of 3d animation effects will not live up to games like Final fantasy VII or Final fantasy IX, obviously because these are from the 16 bit era. But during their time, I cant stress enough that Final Fantasy VI and chrono trigger are two games that really pushed the power and the boundaries of the SNES in regards to graphics.

The graphics in CT are absolutely wonderful, perhaps only being passed by those found in Seiken Densetsu 3 for the title of best looking SNES game. Everything is gorgeous. The character designs done by Akira Toriyama give the characters an anime look and feel to them. The environments in the game look very detailed, colorful, and extremely fitting to the atmosphere. On more than one occasion, Ive found myself gazing at the rich 2D world in awe. This is what 2D games should look like. Chrono Trigger sets a benchmark for all SNES games, and all 2D games in general. Every single person, house, enemy, and blade of grass has its own touch to it. It brings the story to life in a way that cant be matched.

Chrono Trigger is also relatively short, which helps when playing through multiple times. There are many side quests in the game. I guess you can say thats one flaw if I had to put any complaint at all on this title, is its a bit short, in comparison to most Final fantasy Games like IV, VI, VII, VIII, and IX. Most of them aren't necessary to finish the game, but you can get some very valuable items if you take the time to complete them. But being a little on the shorter end gives you more of an incentive to want to replay the game multiple times to unlock all that extra content.

Speaking of extra content, Chrono trigger has an immense amount of extra stuff you can do either during game or post end game. There are so many extra side quests an stuff to accomplish, probably not as much as Final fantasy XII but still very close to it. Each little extra scenario also comes with its own plot threads that help resolve some character background story and adds to the plot, its not just a bunch of typical fetch quests, or hunting monsters.

Chrono Trigger shines in all aspects, but one area where it really shines is music. Famed Composers, Yasunori Mitsuda who also worked on Chrono Cross by himself and Nobuo Uematsu come together to bring you the best music of any game and of any generation that will live on in your memory for years to come.

Out of all my years of playing video games, I've never played a game with better music than Chrono Trigger with the exception of Final fantasy VI. [See my review] Comparing and contrasting musical scores from both games is just extremely difficult for me. Both of them are absolutely stellar, any fan can tell you this rather they knock the game because their a western audience fanbase and they think all jrpgs fall into niche clich category, lots of little minor faults that people point out all the time in video games, especially a small niche genre like jrpgs are accustomed to a lot of hate and debate. There is no denying MUSIC is absolutely both of these games strongest aspects If anyone tells you different or is argumentative and debates this matter, from my personal point of view most likely they are trolling. Every song in the game is well-done, and many of them are simply masterpieces. There are a large variety of musical styles in the game, and each song fits perfectly with its situation, conveying the feeling that it is supposed to just like the phenomenal scores used in Final fantasy VI and other games from the Black Mages

Magus's theme is dark and foreboding, perfect for his character. The song playing while in Guardia Castle is one of my favorites, with a triumphant feel to it. The music playing during major boss battles conveys a sense of awe, importance, and urgency. The imfamous Frog theme during the opening of his characters and the poetic lines of dialogue he uses gives you a sense of a strong personalized character with great leadership qualities much like Cyan's theme in Final fantasy VI. (I do want to stress for those that are probably wondering, the frog dialogue has been changed in the DS version of this game. It no longer has that poetic ancient eastern fantasy dialect that the original had)  The regular battle music is catchy, like many of the songs. The over world map themes are actually some of the best in the game, better than most other games. The music is so good that I actually have the Chrono Trigger soundtrack, and I highly recommend getting it if you can.

Chrono Trigger's replay value is another thing that i absolutly can't forget to mention, for a number of reasons. There are about 12 possible endings you can get, depending on what you do during the game. Playing repeatedly again just to get all the endings alone is worth it. A great feature that adds to the replay value is New Game + This feature at the time was a very unique idea only implemented in a very few selection of games, in fact im not entirely sure if chrono trigger was the first game to implement this feature, it very well could have been but it became so popular that now a days its pretty much used in almost any mainstream title of this generation and last generation and has diverted into various other genres of video gaming. This makes playing through again and getting all of the endings a lot easier. Same with Chrono cross for the playstation. This is also necessary in order to get some of the endings, which I won't spoil.

Chrono Trigger excels in all areas; its gameplay, its story line, its character, personality, graphics and sounds. If that weren't enough, there are twelve different endings you can watch, so there will be a lot of replay value to look forward to and a ton of end game content that make sup for the rather shorter main story. There's very few flaws in this game, that I would go as far as saying it's flawless. The game feels so comfortable, that it molds into you. And the battle system feels so polished; comparing from a visual point of view from many other games on the snes its clear which game has the better graphical quality. you'll never get bored of it. The beautiful cast in Chrono Trigger is unforgettable, and when departing with them, you'll feel kind of sad that the game finally ends.",... that is regarded by many as one of the best RPGs of all time,1446940800,,,

Even in a live class, if the professor were to prattle on like this the audience would be lost out of boredom and wondering what motivated it.  Explain it in the book or on a website, not page after page on the tiny screen.

But there is more on the positive side to say about this software than on the negative.

PRO: This is not a game.  While it could be more engaging and enjoyable I have to say it's extremely well done and really does provide a quality evaluation, drilling, and learning experience.

I do not agree that a mastery of word structure or a more sophisticated vocabulary makes for better communication, but in terms of linguistics this is far more than you could expect from a piece of software made for a handheld gaming device.  Praise goes to Nintendo of course for creating this subculture of handheld gaming as a learning device--and on the cheap--but the creators of this particular software deserve a lot of credit for the level and quality of the content here.

BOTTOM LINE: While I wouldn't recommend this as fun or agree with the premise that better communication is a matter of greater vocabulary, this is a great piece of software for those who want to develop their ability to understand even unfamiliar words, where it's more about your ability to reckon an answer rather than know it.

I love the fact that it teaches the student to think of the composition of words, because this is a valuable reasoning skill. On the other hand, if you're looking for a fun way to digest this material, it doesn't make the grade.

I recommend it for those serious about improving their linguistic abilities, but don't buy the idea that it will make you a better communicator and therefore do such magical things as increase your income or cause people to listen to what you have to say any moreso than they do currently as it seems to be claiming.

While games like Red Dead Redemption may seem hard to match with their high caliber story and gameplay, Mafia 2 is a game that is going to fly under the radar for most gamers. The game follows the protagonist, Vito Scaletta and begins in the early 1940's in the northeastern U.S. and spans across 12 years of his life. To highlight some of the games strong suites, it is evident that the developers focused on polishing the physics and story most. The game runs on NVIDIA physics, which really shines with fully destructible buildings and cover and fine details like the way Vito's suit naturally flows while he's running. Addressing the story, it's one of the best and deepest stories i've seen in a game since Uncharted 2. By the time the credits roll, you feel like you're saying goodbye to a couple of friends, not just a cast of bland and forgettable characters. Although there are some imperfections that hinder the overall quality of this game that are worth noting. One mentionable flaw is the aiming system, which is slightly flawed and generic and I felt like I didn't have as much accuracy as I should've had with a majority of the guns I used throughout the game. Another problem I had with the game was the cover system. There were several instances in the game when I would dig into cover and still take damage, which became somewhat frustrating.

The premise of the game is that Mr. Burns has bought the Springfield bus transit system and it's causing more chaos in Springfield than normal. So, the citizens (led by Homer) decide to fight back and buy back the bus system. They start their own taxi service and need to raise a million dollars to buy the buses back from Burns. There are a total of six levels, five of which can be unlocked as you earn more money. Also, as you earn more money you can unlock more vehicles. Different characters drive the different vehicles. As you drive along, you can smash into lots of different things: knocking over trees, billboards, mailboxes, signs, etc. This game is great to play if you're a Simpsons fan because you get to see Springfield in much more detail than you do on the show. The negatives about the game are that it is quite repetitive and it takes an extensive long haul or a tedious intensive amount of game play (depending on how much time you have and you're gaming style) to beat the game. The sayings each character says are funny at first but after the 100th time of hearing the characters say the same thing, it becomes somewhat annoying. Also, you have to have 2 game cards to play the multiplayer mode and when you only have one game card and two people want to play, it can be aggravating. The game also has a slow load up time so that after you finish a round, it takes about 3-5 minutes before you get to play again.
There is a mission mode on the game as well. It consists of 10 differet missions that are fairly easy to beat (I thought Grandma at the dam and Homer at Burns' mansion were the most difficult levels). If you beat all 10 levels a secret vehicle is unlocked.

THE SIMPSONS ROAD RAGE can be a lot of fun to play. It's basically an average racing video game that's more interesting because of the characters and setting. However, it would make a nice gift for any Simpsons fan and is fun to play on a rainy day.",Just an Average Video Game,1085529600,,,
4.0,False,"04 27, 2016",A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B000JLIXIG,blackaciddevil,"It's July, 1951. An alien race known as the Chimera have taken over Europe. This bizarre alien race has moved westward to infect the entire European continent with a virus that transforms its people into ugly gun-wielding monsters. World War II never happens in this story but humanity's cities still fell. In the midst of this, players assume the role of Sergeant Nathan Hale, a tough-as-nails American soldier that joins Britain's final defense effort. That's where your story begins.

At first glance, you'd be forgiven for thinking this game was a Medal of Honor or Call of Duty game. The land you see before you looks like something out of those games with rubble and steel littered everywhere around you. That's where it ends. When you face your first enemy, you realize it's something quite different. The atmosphere in the game is what makes it so special. At times, it's can be extremely creepy, especially when you're going through dark corridors amd maze-like tunnels. When you think you'll be facing the Chimera, you don't. When you don't think you will, you do. In that respect, Resistance will keep you alert and ready for anything. The weapons, much like in Insomniac's Ratchet and Clank series, come in a wide variety. I won't lie to you, though, Resistance is challenging..very challenging..as in hard as heck. I guarantee you that, if you stick with it, you walk away from the game feeling very satisfied. As for multiplayer, you will be pleased..it's absolutely amazing.

The only gripes I had with the game are that co-op can only be played offline when most games have went online with their co-op and that most of the areas started to look the same to me after awhile. You can count the ending of the game in there, as well. Considering there's a Resistance 2, I guess I could let that one pass.

At any rate, Resistance: Fall of Man is an exceptional FPS game. Considering what I went through to make it to the end of the game, I'm going to have to think about getting the second game in the series. I've played some hard FPS in my time but this one really challenged my expertise in playing this game. I think what I loved most about the game was it's old-school FPS style, Doom 3-like enemies and the fact that challenging yet addictive enough to where you'll want to go back into battle once more. Definitely a FPS that ranks up there with the absolute best of the them. My only gripes about the game is there was just too much grey and brown in the game. Everything seemed to blend in together in the game.",Resistance: Fall of Man.........,1461715200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,True,"01 17, 2012",A6BHE6E9VV5BE,B0029MAXVS,Nishi,"I have always been fascinated with samurais, and this series has always been really cool at allowing you to play as a samurai. You have over 100 weapons available to you, and you can easily find one that fills your play style. This game compares more to the first game than the second one, while obviously has changes between them. On top of those decisions you can create your own character and choose between different heads and outfits.

This games story plays out differently than most games, and it runs about 20+ endings I believe. You decisions and choices in conversations drastically changes the outcome of the game, and people respond better to some choices than others. The game runs about 6-8 hours per ending, but a lot of endings are related to each other (like one simple choice) so you can speed up other endings since you know what's going on. I like how they did this, while it's not Metal Gear or anything, it's a nice change of pace to play these games every now and then.

The game play is a mix of samurai action and arcade fighter. When you're fighting enemies you focus on one at a time, and when you take them out another steps in. with the variety of weapons available you can do sweeping attacks with some them and take out multiple people, even if you're just focusing on one. The map is broken up into a bunch of different areas, and you can visit all of them from the get go. Blue exclamation marks show the inklings (story) events you can see, and even the order as you see some of these changes the game.

You can kill every person you see in this game (Kids excluded), and this also can change the outcome of the game. If certain NPC's die that can mess up certain events you want to do, and people even get scared of you the more you kill and they run away. One interesting thing they threw in the game is that if you buy a bunch of stuff from one of the stores, and if you kill them you can get your money back.

The graphics are basically good PS2 era. While I know that the graphics where on the back burner for a fun game, I still would like some next gen graphics. It's not too bad though, and doesn't take away from the playability of the game. The sound swords make and what happens to the people when they get hit is pretty cool, but the remix main theme from the game is the best sound effect.

Not many samurai games are out there that let you make decisions and provide you with all these different weapons. If you can over look the graphics and some minor annoyances, this can be a fun samurai game that everything you do affects the outcome of the game. Just a heads up though, this is one of those games that are only on sale for a bit before they stop making them, so if your remotely interested pick one up before it picks up in price. I got mine on sale at gamestop, so I have a feeling that has already happened.

Length: As I said before there are multiple different ends and some can be done real fast, while others take longer to do. The game keeps a tally of the total hours that you have played, so that's nice to keep track of when you're replaying this a lot. If you like collecting items you can exceed over 50 hours or more trying to get everything.

Trophies / Achievements: These games trophies are pretty time consuming. Each different type of weapon group has a stance, and trophies are related to these stances. In order to get the complete move collection you have to collect Every. Last. Weapon. (102+ I think) This takes a long time to do, and keep in mind all the other trophies for getting all the endings, 100 chain kills, and so many others. I'm at 50-60 hours right now and I haven't got the platinum yet, so this can take you awhile to platinum this game.

They still sound great, fit comfortably, work properly and show almost no visible wear after three years of ownership despite near constant use.  HyperX is our first choice when buying gaming headphones.  My original review from 2014 is below.

I bought these for my son for Christmas.  He was previously using a set of gaming headphones that cost $250.  The sound of the prior set was good but he says these sound better.  He wears them constantly so I took a listen and the sound quality is very good.  I haven't personally tried the mic but he uses it on a constant basis and says it is clear and other people hear him loud and clear.  He was so impressed, he actually bought a second set as a gift for his girlfriend.  The one complaint/disappointment that I had with the $250 Sennheiser headphones that preceded these was the fact that they literally fell apart from regular use right at the end of the two-year warranty.  For $250, you'd expect a little longer life if despite regular use, you take care of a product and don't abuse it.  If these can prove they have equivalent or better longevity, they will prove to be a much, much better bargain.  Time will tell but for now, this headset is attractive, comfortable and sounds great.  I may very well be ordering a third pair for myself.  I'm not a gamer but looking for something decent for Skype and possibly VOIP apps.","Comfy, loud and clear, both cups and mic.",1419984000,,"{'Color:': ' Black', 'Style:': ' Headset'}",

3.0,False,"06 19, 2012",A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B00178630A,Moviedude,"Diablo III is possibly the most hotly anticipated PC game of all time, and considering the huge following of Diablo II, it had some big shoes to fill. The game we got has ended up being very divisive- a lot of folks don't like it much, as evidenced by its rating here. I love it to pieces, but a lot of the experience SURROUNDING the game is hugely disappointing. I'll spare you summaries and just jump to the key points:

GAMEPLAY
The area where D3 most shines. Gameplay feels a LOT like Diablo II, but a bit more dynamic and alive- knockback actually launches enemies (and you) into the air, there are dodge moves, and magic spells are a lot more diverse than in the past. The game feels even more arcade-like than its predecessor with big, flashy fights that are a lot of fun (if a little confusing at times). Purists aren't all happy with how skills work- unlike Diablo II you can unlock every skill for your character, and they level up automatically as you do. This means you probably won't build 3 or 4 barbarians for kicks, but it also means no more working on your character for weeks only to realize you built them wrong. Controls are slick and responsive.

GRAPHICS
Diablo III is a direct evolution from Diablo II artistically. That means you see everything from a locked 3/4 perspective; any zooming during cutscenes is lenticular and not physical. During gameplay you cannot zoom or rotate. This is all done to accomodate the clever use of sprites and low-poly models to simulate a much more detailed world than actually exists in-game. It works to a point. Outdoor environments look outstanding, and everything has a sort of painterly look to it. However here and there a tree will look a bit flat or a character model will show a rough corner. This game was in development a long time and it shows. I can't help but feel that the graphics also suffer so that the game can accommodate the weaker computers of Blizzard fans who thusfar have only played the lower-requirement World of Warcraft. That's great and all, but I don't like my experience suffering so Blizzard can double-dip on its fanbase.

SOUND
It's a Blizzard game. They do game audio better than just about anyone, except maybe Valve. Not really much else to say, if you played Diablo I and II you can guess about how this one will sound.

MULTIPLAYER
Here's where things begin to unravel a little. Multiplayer itself is fast and seamless- find your friends, join their game, PROFIT. But the general chat channel is full of spambots, and you will get constant friend requests from spammers. Welcome to the Blizzard social hell that WoW players have endured since the dawn of time. Crooked BS and suspect invites are so rampant that generally you will end up just playing with friends and gradually friending THEIR friends- a sad thing when starting a fully public game is pretty easy. But what should be a fun experience with neat strangers gets old fast when a couple scammers jump in your game.
Two more downsides are that multiplayer servers hold only 4 people (half of Diablo II's limit) and PVP, a much advertised feature, does not actually exist yet.

SUPPORT
The dealbreaker for many. Diablo III requires that you be logged into Battlenet to play. Battlenet undergoes more maintenance than Cher's bustline. If you were one of the thousands of people who skipped work to play on launch day you got a nice 6 hour break in the middle of the day when your game was unplayable. It's gotten better, but there are still outages, particularly in the EU. The number of times Diablo II went down for me? ZERO. Just saying. So far the always-online aspect SEEMS to at least prevent cheating, but then I only play with people I know.

THE ENDGAME
Diablo fans know you don't beat the game in one playthrough- it now takes 4 thanks to a new difficulty, Inferno. Unfortunately, somewhere in your road to victory you will probably hit a wall. At level 60 you stop leveling and only improve through gear, which means eventually you must stop by the AUCTION HOUSE. 2 are on tap, a cash one and one that uses in-game currency. Both are grossly inflated. A lot of people resent having to buy and sell in order to progress, rightly saying that the auction mechanic hurts immersion and slows gameplay. I don't mind it but I won't call those people wrong either.

OVERALL
Diablo III is in most respects the game I wanted- an action-packed hack'n'slash with adequate graphics, great sound, and fun multiplayer. Could it be better? Absolutely, and given Blizzard's reputation for perfection (everyone forgets Rock'n'Roll Racing) that may cost it more points than it would another game. It's hard not to balk at all the Warcraft conceits slipping into Diablo, or Blizzard's dodgy servers, or how many ways the game feels scaled back. BUT it's still a Blizzard game, it's STILL Diablo, and it's STILL better than 9/10 of what's on the market.

5.0,False,"09 5, 2003",AD5SBCRHOMAQE,B00009YEJY,Mike,"The first time I saw the review from IGN I knew that I have to get a hold of this game... I did, and boy am I impressed :D well I understand it's way better than FFT since this was made a while back but the innovations Nippon Ichi (published by Atlus) added to the game is way more and fun compared to FFT.
First off you can replay the game all over again with all of your items/lvl/characters etc. intact concerning the game has different endings depending on your actions in the game. Talk about replay value (more info why below).
Second, you have control on how hard the enemies are later in the game so if the bosses are too easy you can go to the dark assembly and make a vote to make the enemies harder or vice versa, same goes with items, special skills, weapons, and locked levels.
Third, character development has never been so diversed as you can upgrade a characters skills through an action called ""transmigration"" where you can change a characters class ie. a Ronin to a Ranger while keeping some of the original skills max of 95%. Item/weapon upgrades can be done also by going inside them hence called ""Item World"" where the further down you go inside an item the higher its lvl gets. Can you get to the bottom :D with this you can create a character who knows mostly every skills a character can have, but that is for people who wants to spend a lot of time with it as a character can go all the way to Lvl 10000 no more lvl 100 but all the way to lvl 10000, so you can see how deep this game is even after you finished it.
Fourth, the story line is pretty good as it starts where you get to know each of the characters in the beginning in a funny way and once further down the episodes (14 I believe) you get to see some drama as you uncover certain truths about prince Laharl and his vassals and the changes in them as the story progresses, I was surprised on how they were able to blend comedy and drama without tripping (thank Flonne and Etna for that Laharl is pure evil :) those 2 are there to keep him in check).... a piece or work and pretty good voice acting too I'm impressed. Also the original Japanese audio are all included just for info.
Fifth, Geo Panels, almost forgot those brain burners heh heh. If you want a more (thinking) challenge you can go and work on the geo panels and symbols and create chain hits so your bonus gauge will go up and receive more items after a battle. It's better to learn it in-game as it's a long process to explain how to do it. And when it reads ""Strategy RPG"" It MEANS it. The further in the game you are, the more you really have to think it through each battle as its not just out hack/slash win type of deal, you have to utilize lifting characters to avoid damages, 4x combo attacks, and area damage management, etc. (you learn this early in the game so its easy to understand) way deeper than FFT. Battle special effects when casting high level spells or skills are just awesome also it also shows some ""ahem"" air DBZ combos depending on the class you're using.
Sixth, the BAD part about the game (here we go) is the camera angle once in a while as its hard to see some level board when theres tall hills or towers when you're trying to adjust where your character is going to stand, adding a birds eye view or camera tilting would have helped a lot. Also, a higher resolution character images would have made it much better as whenever the camera goes closer the character sprites just starts to get blurry (compliments to anti-aliasing), it would be nice if they are the same resolution as Guilty Gear XX.
There is still more but all of these I typed are all based on me playing the game. I still have 1.5 episodes to go the time I posted this. So far the game hasn't slowed down a bit. So if you're into FFT, Ogre Battle, Hoshigami, Kartia heck Strategy RPGs this is a no brainer.",A lot of fun,1062720000,12,,

No one has made one that's as fun, has as gripping  a storyline and artwork, or depth and replayability of gameplay. It's a  work of genius. I've had it for two years and I still play it at least a  couple of times a week. There's even one mission left that I haven't  managed to conquer without cheating, so the challenge is definitely  there.
What you have to understand about Starcraft is that it's not meant  to be a cutting-edge feature-heavy supergame where you can customize the  behavior of your units and give them complex orders. It's meant to be more  of a strategy game like real-time chess, and in this it succeeds  brilliantly. It shares the quality of chess in that there are a limited  number of units with straightforward abilities, but there are an infinite  number of things and strategies that you can do with them. To this day  players are still inventing new strategies for these units and races.
The  artificial intelligence and pathfinding of the game is the best I've ever  seen. No RTS game has perfect AI or pathfinding (units getting lost or  tangled up on each other or the terrain), but Starcraft's is by far better  than any others out there. The computer will flatten you time and again  unless you're playing competently.
Multiplayer is a complete blast, and  more options are offered than any other RTS game. You can play team games  where you and your allies are actually controlling the same units against  the computer or others, in addition to a wide range of variations like  Capture the Flag, etc.
Blizzard's Battle.net service is free and at any  time of day there are literally thousands of people playing. Internet play  is smooth. I've played friends both nationally and internationally with bad  connections and low-end computers, and it runs solidly even with the  additional traffic of voice chat like Roger Wilco over 56k!
Blizzard's  continuing support for the game is also excellent. They release a new map  for the game every Friday like clockwork, so there are over a hundred new,  well-designed maps available for download and replay.
In summary, just a  solid, solid, completely fun game. You can't possibly go wrong by picking  up a copy.",..and I don't hand out 5 stars lightly.,959904000,281,,
5.0,True,"06 8, 2011",A2WPX0EE2DZGYK,B001SH7YMG,Axle F.,"(Single player review... As Always, I don't care about multi-player)

NOTE TO VIDEOGAME DEVELOPERS: If you want to lessen piracy, and make more money, then make more games like this one.

I just finished playing this game on the XBOX 360 system, and I have to say.... WOW! Now if only it would be released on PC for better graphics to make the immersion even better.

This is a long game, and worth every penny! I do NOT feel ripped off in any way like a lot of single-player games have done recently with short 4 or 5 hour campaigns put in just to sell to people that don't like the multi-player aspect, and scam them out of their hard earned money (or in the case of a large amount of console players, mom and dads money)... There were at least 5 parts in this game that I thought it was the end of the game, only to be surprised that it kept on going. This game is a great escape from reality and I love that!

The scenery is beautiful, and on a nice big HD TV, it is quite engrossing. There were many times I would stop playing just to look at a sunset, or a thunder storm off in the distance. It really felt like a proper western game. Taking place in 1911, I could ""feel"" the changes coming about in that particular time. It gave this great feeling of the end of an era; Rockstar clearly did their research with this game.

This game did NOT get boring for me, as there are tons of things to do besides just missions. I am a huge fan of non-linear games and this one delivers in nearly every way. From bounty missions, to hunting, to playing all manner of gambling and old west games, to stranger quests and challenges, to riding around and exploring for treasure or new places, just to name a few. If there is something you saw in a western movie, there is a good chance you can do it in this game... From robbing a train to a stage coach or protecting them... Getting into quick draw shootouts. Jumping from a balcony right onto your horse saddle and riding off... Jumping from your horse to a moving train... Climbing up a mountain pass overlooking a camp full of bad guys and then taking pot shots from above... And many more things. The game gives you a choice between being a good guy or bad guy and a few RPG like choices in the game that will affect other parts later on. so the REPLAY value is downright awesome.

This is NOT a game that I will play just once and forget about it. This is definitely a keeper! It even has some awesome single player cheat codes that can make it quite silly and fun and even less annoying in some situations. Nothing like a good old invincibility, and infinite ammo code to make for some interesting times in any game. ^_^ Though using cheat codes disables achievements for that particular save, but achievements on XBOX 360 aren't good for anything anyway so it's no big loss. The most recent patch now allows you to save and progress the story even with cheats enabled, so that is why I waited so long to buy it, even though I played through the first time without cheats.

The voice acting and writing in this game are top notch. You actually feel a bond with the characters in Red Dead and want to see their stories unfold. It is a truly immersive game, and that is not something a lot of recent games can lay claim to.

The controls took a little getting used to. This is where one of my only gripes comes up... Aiming is a pain and the vehicle/horse controls needed some work. There were plenty of times where I would try to aim at one target and end up locking onto a totally different one, sometimes accidentally shooting some random guy off in the distance instead of the skunk or coyote I was trying to hunt... Next thing I know is the coyote got away and now I have a bounty on my head and a posse trying to kill me for the guy I accidentally shot. Or many times I would want to free-aim at some object and instead lock onto a random person instead and end up getting a bounty or shot for pointing a gun at someone. To get a horse going you have to constantly hit the A button, but to stop you have to hold the RB shoulder button, and aiming while trying to follow a road while on a horse is nearly impossible, even though during the tutorial it said while aiming that the horse would follow the road, I found that to be a bit far from the truth. But that is all I can really complain about in this game. Oh! There needed to be BAR FIGHTS! That was the one western movie staple I haven't seen yet.

I had to post a review for Red Dead Redemption because, recently, very few games released truly make my jaw drop and get me to play the game in awe. It is a long game with hundreds, if not thousands, of things to do and a 100% replay value, at least for me. The atmosphere, graphics, physics, and effects are wonderfully done even if it is on an outdated console system (by PC standards). The characters are VERY memorable and well done. The writing and voice acting were spot on! This did not feel like a rushed game. I would have to say that Red Dead Redemption will go on as one of the greats in the videogame world.

Because of this game, I am now on a Western Movie kick. Ah Nostalgia.

I still find it a bit difficult to kill people but it got to be easier,Basically you have to counter attack them every time in order to kill them Like 6 or 7 stabs and they are dead which is unrealistic.

I find it very hard to kill people you have to strike them like 5 times for them to die, Where in brotherhood only once. The guns are very hard to shoot, And he walks funny Compared to Ezio with ezio I feel like I have control, If a guard spots you then it takes like 5 mins to loose them which is very annoying.

Pros:
1- Graphics, they are beautiful.
2- Side quests, the most original I have ever seen.
3- Character morphing, the physical appearance of both you and your dog will change according to your actions, as will the interaction of NPC's with you.
4- The dog, he never gets in your way, he can't die, and he helps in combat.
5- Family, I like having this option; you can have a wife, kids, its quite fun.
6- Multiplayer, you can bring a friend.

Cons:
1- Combat, while they did improve range combat from the first game, I think they took a step backward in melee and magic, they just aren't as fun.
2- Character customization, you can really only customize which type of combat your character will excel in, and since combat is boring who cares.
3- Boss fights, where did they go?  The first game had lots, this game has none.
4- Difficulty, there is only one setting and it is very easy, I didn't die once, there was no challenge.
5- Itemization, because the game is so easy it hardly matters what weapons you carry and there is such a small variety that it's really quite sad.  As for clothing, I like being able to wear what I want without wishing it had better stats, but why didn't the developers give each piece of clothing an empty augment slot and allow the character to put something in there like ""increase health by 5%"" or something...
6- Economy, money is way to easy to get, this makes every item in the game have no value.
7- Unique items, there should be more and they should be better than items you can purchase, to add to their value.
8- Tediousness, decorating houses is not as simple as the first game, adjusting prices has to be done individually, why can't I say `every house in Bowerstone increase by 20'?
9- Going evil, if you go completely evil every NPC will run away from you screaming, this is not as cool as it sounds since you won't be able to interact with anyone.
10- Multiplayer, your friend's character won't look like his character, what's that about?
11- Dig spots and chests, neither holds anything of value since money is easy to come buy, in the first game these had some meaning.
12- Story, the main quest was short and boring, the first games story was much more interesting in my opinion and also wasn't over so quickly.

3.0,False,"08 10, 2007",A1DOSVAXU8CMOO,B000FPM3HS,forweg,"As the teen and young adult male populations tend to consume the profit-making minds of game developers, anything (even superficially) deemed too ""kiddie"" or ""girly"" is often left out. Females that aren't either boring sex ciphers, perky and cute anime archetypes, or unrealistic, token ""strong women"" are a rare sight in the video game universe. Young children in active roles are practically non-existent.

It's encouraging, then, to see Rule of Rose break these two annoying trends. The player takes control of Jennifer, an English schoolgirl who arrives in a bus at a big, spooky house. The premise may seem entirely generic at first, but this is intentional. Absolutely nothing is know of Jennifer's past or even her life at the outset. However, as the game unravels, more and more is revealed until we learn her devastating history.

As a mystery/horror story, Rule of Rose is a sparkling success. Jennifer runs into and is basically imprisoned by the girls of the Red Crayon Aristocrats. Each girl has a widely different personality, but they are all sadistic yet vulnerable. The Aristocrats function as a sort of female version of Lord of the Flies. Those on top are treated as royalty, while those on the bottom are treated as sub-human filth.

This game achieves what so little others do: The player strongly feels for Jennifer and is worried for her. While playing, I felt as Jennifer felt, and desperately wanted her to escape.

The children accentuate this by being perfectly voiced, with not a rotten apple in the bunch. Everyone has genuine English accents, which is vital for believability. No one sounds as if they are simply reading lines, and I never even thought about the voice acting while playing. Which is as it should be.

Slow strings are the musical medium of choice for much of Rule of Rose, and they go well enough with the atmosphere. Slow, tense music plays during suspenseful moments, dramatic songs play during emotional scenes, and faster, intense strings play during battle. Again, it all fits the mood nicely, but there's nothing here that's memorable or of interest outside the game.

Clever visual motifs further engross the player into this strange world. Wiggly, child-like animations are used quite a bit, such as in loading screens, chapter introductions, and in books (which serve a similar purpose as memos or notes do in other horror games). These childish doodles often portray brutal content, making them eerie and surreal.

The in-game graphics are at about the standard for PS2 horror titles. There's nothing here pushing system limits, but nothing noticeably sub-par either. The main cast are understandably much more detailed than other characters.

With such a nice environment and theme, the developers had a real gem in their hands. It's too bad, then, that they actually make you play the game.

As Jennifer explores, she will inevitably encounter odd, child-like ghouls. Sadly, she will virtually only encounter these creatures. Lifeless, malicious zombie children? Sure, that's pretty creepy. Unfortunately, the scare factor is completely eliminated when you see them every other step.

Jennifer must use whatever she finds lying around to fight her pursuers. Not many guns or swords here. Sure, Jennifer shouldn't be a naturally gifted warrior, but she should cause damage when her entire weapon and arm go through a fiend's body.

Even worse, most foes can harm Jennifer with punches or stabs from several feet away! Or sometimes, even when they're facing the other direction! Horrid hit detection mars Rule of Rose consistently and significantly. This is an unacceptable game design flaw, as it makes combat almost unbearable.

This nagging problem particularly shows its ugly face during the few boss fights, which should be the peak of enjoyment in most games. The bosses in Rule of Rose are uniformly monotonous, cheap, and tiresome.

Most of these bosses are challenging for all the wrong reasons. They perform the same actions again and again and are entirely predictable. It doesn't matter, though, for along with the monstrous hit detection, Jennifer is as slow as a slug. Both in terms of running speed and arm swing, my 87 year-old grandma is faster.

These flaws make battles more a game of luck than a test of skill. Did you see that move five seconds in advance? Too bad, you die regardless. Did you work to get behind an enemy to stab him in the back? Oops, missed anyway!

The exploration elements aren't much better. The game is primarily set in a bizarre, 1930's-style airship, and that's where you'll be exploring most. While this airship is fascinating at first, you will quickly grow tired of it as the game requires you to traverse the same areas over and over. Jennifer's lethargic trot doesn't help matters here, either.

Jennifer is accompanied by her dog Brown through most of her journey. While he helps a tiny bit in combat, Brown's main function is to sniff out hidden items. You can let Brown sniff most items in the inventory, and he'll find something related. While this is a novel and interesting aspect, it can get tedious after a while. It does help the player feel affection for Brown, at least.

I often found myself struggling through the game in order to see what happens to Jennifer next. I'm not sure who's crueler: the Aristocrat girls for their evil antics, or the developers for creating such an irresistibly addicting yet agonizingly flawed game.

Judging games like this, ones which have disastrous gameplay yet are good to perfect in every other area, is always difficult. Should you play Rule of Rose? It ultimately comes down to personal taste. If gameplay is categorically the most important part of a game to you, with no exceptions, then absolutely not. If you're willing to ignore severe blemishes to witness a wonderful drama, then yes.

I had figured that there would be little to no chance of the game bearing any sort of resemblance to the franchise we all know and love.  Well, I was wrong.  Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is a stunning achievement in every sense of the word, as the series' debut on the DS not only manages to retain nearly everything that made the series so great and revolutionary on home consoles, but in some cases even improves on them.  Taking place in Liberty City, Chinatown Wars finds you in the shoes of Huang, who is looking to avenge the death of his gangster father.  While the game provides a good story and memorable enough characters, Chinatown Wars also features the tried and true classic GTA gameplay, which is a surprise and an achievement in themselves in translating all of these features to the DS.  Translating the Liberty City from GTA IV is also brilliantly done, and there are tons of side missions and optional activities, along with two-player multiplayer modes; all of which will keep you busy for quite some time.  The game's graphics can appear occasionally grainy in some spots, but for the most part, achieving these kinds of visuals on the DS needs to be seen to be believed.

- There's way, way, way too much talk. I love to read, and a certain amount of conversation doesn't bother me at all in a game. This was just over the edge, though. There were conversations that lasted more than 15 minutes, and ultimately weren't really very interesting.
- There's no good way to skip animation. April (the main character) walks from place to place, and you have to sit and watch her walk. You can make her run, which is a little better. You can also hit the escape key to skip the animation, but it only skips it ahead a little -- so to get her from one place to another fast, you have to keep hitting ""escape."" It would have been nice -- and pretty darned easy -- to make it possible to click from one location to another once they've already been visited.
- Some of the puzzles are entirely based on ""hunt the pixel"" -- success hinges on finding the one tiny pixel that's hidden behind something else. I want puzzles to require intelligence and flexibility on my part, not keen eyesight and infinite patience in moving the mouse over the screen.
The game *was* good. The voice acting was excellent, the graphics were pretty, and the characters were engaging. The story was also very good (though some threads never got resolved, which was annoying).
""The Longest Journey"" has very little replay potential -- it would be too tedious to watch April walk around and talk to people once you know how the story turns out.

It can easily hold some apps like Facebook/Netflix and few music albums. I can also download 2-3 game demos. The Content Manager can help move infrequently used data to a PC or PS3 to alleviate space issue if you don't need to have all content available at once.

I initially bought this thinking that's all I need. But after playing some of the games, it became obviously that the games are worthwhile to keep, and many have replay value and therefore best to be downloaded to minimize swapping. Also I really liked to try many games and downloaded plenty of demos. Given the amount of stuff I now want to download from PSN, I opt for the pricey 32GB card.

But your situation may only require this 4GB version then there wouldn't be a reason to spend more money buying bigger capacity.

I've never played the first two L&O games so I cannot compare Justice is Served with them but I can compare it to other adventure games. I didn't find the game interesting at all and I thought it was really cumbersome. Unless I missed something, in order to save a game the player has to access the Menu, select Save, choose a spot for the game (there were only about a dozen save slots), press Save which brings up the Menu again and then select Resume Game. That's an awful lot of steps when you're like me and saving every couple minutes. There is no autosave feature which would have made the process easier.

But the whole ""Save"" issue wouldn't be a big deal if I had liked the game. I just didn't find it interesting to spend most of the game asking people questions. Many questions/answers led to a new location to visit but when you get there there isn't much to do - minimal exploration (you find only a few hotspots and not all on them are relevant) and the puzzles are incredibly easy. Find something locked and you'll find the answer on an item you found at a hotspot - almost always at the same location you find the puzzle. The only puzzle I had a problem with was a musical one.

I got as far as the court room but the accused ended up being acquitted and I just didn't care enough to return to a saved game and retry the case. For me there just wasn't enough content to make the game interesting. I had just finished playing Myst III before playing Justice is Served so it is rather difficult to top that for gameplay.",Just didn't care for it,1099008000,6,,

Sadly, the previous owner didn't take good care of it, so I couldn't play it very affectively. I sold it to gamestop for someone else to be tricked into buying it.

  *Well, it's doom. Can't argue with that.
  *I hated the controlls, but you can pick a diffrent controll layout.
  *I haven't beaten it yet, but I found that most of my favorite levels were still there.

The Bad;
  *They cut out the cybie and spider battle.
  *The graphics are... balls.
  *The save and load screen tells you the level your on, not the name though. (Ex. ""L8"" instead of ""tower of babel"".)
  *I felt like even on Nightmare mode, that I was rushing through the levels in like 3 minutes a piece. (Of course, I'm beast at Doom.)
  *The music was terrible. (beep beep beep bop, beep beep beep bop) compared to (AWESOME GUTAIR SOLO) on the SNES.
  *It wasn't even it's own port! It was a direct port of the Atari Jaguar version I believe.

It is a game of you spending a trillion hours killing stuff and getting loot. Let's not make this game and it's expansion into something it's not, okay?  ROS makes D3 a little more tolerable and introduces a campaign that ""ties up loose ends"" that were seemingly unresolved with the ending of D3. And of course the ROS expansion establishes the need for a Diablo 4 or 20 more D3 expansions like WOW keeps puking out, whichever the developer feels with maximize profit with minimal effort on their part.

The main reason I say this improves D3 is simple: The loot system is upgraded and waaaaay more rewarding. I beat D3 several times (demon hunter, wizard, monk) and on the verge with barbarian. Each time I got very few legendary drops, and when I did the drops WERENT EVEN MEANT FOR MY CHARACTER TO USE. Talk about B.S. Well, get ready folks because that's a thing of the past. Now you get legendary/rare drops all the time (which makes me laugh at those idiots who spent actual money acquiring legendary stuff and now it's all worthless)!

I'm glad the auction house is gone. It became a wretched hive of scum and villainy. I see where the developers wanted to go with this, and this was in essence an apology for the lousy loot awarding system. However, it was quickly perverted, as most things on the internet into a nest of fat greasy virgins with nothing better to do with their lives than gain at the expense of others. As quickly as multiplayer makes a game more fun, it also makes it suck when you add the wrong types of people into the mix.

Pros: Love the graphics, love the animations, and really love the music. No more auction house, more epic loot drops, crazy monsters and beasts to slay and slay and slay and slay. Cinematics are purty as always.

Cons: Crusader is kind of dull addition. Malthael isn't the hardest boss to kill. Probably the first of either many expansions or a nice pivot to the next D4 game. Repetitive to the point where both arms will fall off from carpal tunnel. RAGE INDUCING ENEMIES WITH WALLING ABILITIES.
